<section id="jul-18" class="level1">
<h1>Jul 18</h1>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.</p>
<p>Thanks to JC, VAC, BE, and IA for sharing links and thoughts.</p>
<section id="testimony-on-the-hill" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="testimony-on-the-hill">Testimony on the hill</h2>
<p>(The testimony in front of the House Committee on Education &amp; Workforce seems not to have dealt any serious blows to any of the three leaders, including CUNY’s Chancellor – Stefanik’s predictable demand that he be fired has not been amplified, save for in the Times of India. The rope-a-dope style where responses fall back on policies and carrying them out while admitting individual tweets or comments may be reprehensible might be smart politics, but leaves a sour taste. The rope-a-dope is meant to tire people out for a counter attack, and the latter wasn’t the intent. I felt there were more than a few missed opportunities:</p>
<p>I thought Stefanik’s questioning on Abda had such a faulty premise – she had worked at CAIR so shouldn’t be employable – needed some push back. There was not a hint of suggestion that her work for CUNY has been problematic or compromised, yet people should be fired. Plus, the NYT reported her characterization of CAIR is wholly unfounded.</p>
<p>Her question about CUNY clear was so poorly framed as to require a reprimand by the ranking member in his closing – people accused deserve representation and the egregious examples of this particular case are so bad something could have been said beyond they choose their own cases.</p>
<p>The Hunter College questions involved showing someone’s email–doxxing–and was essentially a call for punishment for involving the police in a police matter. [thanks EI]</p>
<p>The questions about Jewish Faculty being represented by the PSC from one congressman who tried to get the Chancellor to admit it was unfair could have had much more pushback – this case was appealed to the supreme court which declined to hear it. Basically this congressman was asking the Chancellor to go against several judge’s opinions. Maybe pointing that out shows the ridiculousness of this and other questions.</p>
<p>The PSC positions were mis-characterized; the PSC Chair was personally dragged and mis-characterized–the rope-a-dope that the union is an independent group could have been turned into a counterattack to the assault on faculty unions in general.</p>
<p>If any good came out of this, hopefully it will be the republican majority realizing these hearings have totally lost their potency. Maybe the reporting next time will pick up the consistent message of the democrats that these aren’t seriously trying to understand a problem.)</p>

<p>The congressional hearings don’t appear to pack as much punch as they once did, when it felt like college presidents’ jobs were on the line.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Trump administration’s campaign is like The Wizard of Oz, he [Nosanchuk, former civil-rights official] said, because it’s “projecting an intimidating, demanding, and illusory image of action, but here the man behind the curtain cancels funds for civil-rights enforcement and cancer research.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Rep.&nbsp;Virginia Foxx, a Republican of North Carolina, mentioned the fact that the influential union has passed multiple BDS resolutions, and that it has been found responsible for discrimination against a Jewish faculty member by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In a statement Tuesday, the president of the PSC, James C. Davis, slammed Republicans’ “attempt to smear CUNY and our union as antisemitic.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“We do not accept the false premise that underlies today’s hearing that any campus activism in support of the Palestinian people is antisemitic, if not criminal,” Davis wrote. “As a union, we do not have a position on BDS and do not have Israel divestment policies.”</p>

<p>For the fifth time since late 2023, congressional Republicans on Tuesday interrogated a group of university leaders about campus antisemitism. But unlike previous hearings, this one was short on fireworks and viral moments</p>

<p>(Grill was the headline choice of many others, mostly the slanted right side of reporting)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Some of the toughest questioning of Matos Rodríguez again came from Stefanik, an ally of President Donald Trump who is reportedly considering a run for governor in New York after the president withdrew her nomination to be U.N. Ambassador to protect Republicans’ slim majority in the House.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>PSC president Davis then went on to decry what he saw as a clamp down on free speech across the university campuses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“CUNY administrators have investigated faculty for the terms in which they discuss the war in Gaza in their classes, limited the time, place, and manner for exercising the right to free expression on campus, invited police violence against non-violent student protestors, and even fired faculty in apparent retribution for their political activism,” Davis said. “It is still not enough to satisfy the new McCarthyites. Universities must stand against fascism, not accommodate it.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On Tuesday, Republicans accused the university leaders of fostering an antisemitic climate and failing to rein in professors and students the lawmakers said were antisemitic. Democrats on the committee argued the hearing was part of a crackdown on speech that attempted to scapegoat academia for a broader societal problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The university leaders, meanwhile, seemed to have learned from the past. They attempted, with apparent success, to avoid the kinds of viral moments that have characterized previous antisemitism hearings and brought down other university presidents.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>She [Stefanik] attacked CUNY for hiring a former employee of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights organization, inaccurately suggesting that CAIR had been a “co-conspirator in a terrorist financing case.” (The group was listed as an “unindicted co-conspirator or joint venturer” in a case against a charity, the Holy Land Foundation, along with more than 200 other groups and individuals. It was not accused of a crime.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Responding to Ms.&nbsp;Stefanik’s attacks on Tuesday, CAIR’s national deputy director, Edward Ahmed Mitchell, said the “spirit of Joseph McCarthy is alive and well.” “Representing Mahmoud Khalil and others targeted by the government because they advocated for Palestinian rights is not only our prerogative as lawyers at CLEAR,” said Mr.&nbsp;Kassem, the CUNY law professor who founded the legal clinic, “it is also our pride and privilege.”</p>

<p>(Cuz why? don’t ask – CUNY hired someone she didn’t like who in several years has no complaints mentioned about her work; lawyers represent people before they are proven not guilty or guilty?)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Republican congresswoman zeroed in on Chancellor Félix Matos Rodríguez over the hiring of a chief diversity officer who previously worked for a pro-Hamas, Israel-bashing group — saying that if the CUNY boss doesn’t step down, Gov.&nbsp;Kathy Hochul should bounce him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Stefanik also asked Matos Rodríguez if he knew that law professor Ramzi Kassem, the head of CUNY Law School’s legal clinic, Creating Law Enforcement Accountability &amp; Responsibility or CLEAR, was representing Mahmoud Khalil, the anti-Israel Columbia University protester who was detained by the Trump administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In a joint press conference after the hearing with Brooklyn Councilwoman Inna Vernikov in DC, Stefanik said Matos Rodríguez had to go, and claimed Hochul was part of the problem.</p>

<li>What Trump’s Bombast Reveals About His Vision for Higher Ed</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/15/how-public-attacks-harvard-harm-all-higher-ed">https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/15/how-public-attacks-harvard-harm-all-higher-ed</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Q: Do you think the administration has a vision for higher education in particular?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A: I think it’s a vision for America, and Trump has been remarkably clear on what that looks like. It’s an America defined pretty narrowly on racial, ethnic and religious terms. It’s an America that has a certain understanding of its history that aligns with those dominant religious, racial and ethnic groups. It’s an America that has doubled down on masculinity as its defining gender in terms of who should be in power and have power in public life. So when we talk about a vision for higher ed, it’s a higher ed that serves that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This is what you see in these very vague pronouncements about things like DEI. Anyone who educates or does research on anything that runs counter to that celebration of a very particularistic America is suspect and un-American. Higher ed is part of a whole set of knowledge-producing institutions in society—we can think about journalists and scientists, too— as being problematic because they serve accountability functions. They hold corporations responsible for things like polluting. They hold executives responsible for violations of democratic norms. Or, you know, they hold people in power accountable for not being good custodians of public trust. I think the administration wants to weaken that accountability function that can be played by universities because it undermines, ultimately, their ability to exercise power in the service of that larger vision of what they believe America should be.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Q: You mentioned vague pronouncements about things like DEI. What conclusions do you draw from this tactic of sowing confusion and using unclear and undefined language?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A: Ultimately, the end goal is control. They have a few tools to do so—legal means, regulatory means—and they have a lot of funding means to get institutions that are otherwise autonomous in civil society to comply with what they want them to do. But in the absence of those levers, what do you use? Well, you use publicity to get willing compliance or anticipatory compliance.</p>

<li>Why Universities Are So Powerless in Their Fight Against Trump</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The administration’s moves to slash federal funding are just one part of a concerted effort to force major research universities to change how they pursue their core missions. And yet the sector’s most full-throated response — an American Association of Colleges and Universities statement signed by over 600 academic leaders — makes only vague reference to “constructive reform” while rejecting coercive uses of public funding. Widely adopted faculty resolutions calling for mutual-defense pacts amount to little more than suggestions that have yet to bear fruit. The most successful instances of collective resistance to date are four lawsuits challenging agency indirect-cost policies. By my count, 23 universities have joined at least one of those suits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A decentralized organizational structure puts resources and decision-making authority nearer to the ground, allowing different units of the university to prioritize the things their work requires. Faculties in business, social work, or law can make curricular, hiring, and promotion decisions largely independent of each other and of colleagues in arts and sciences, each tuning their activities to their specific needs, goals, and vision. Decentralization also explains why universities rarely articulate detailed, actionable principles that unequivocally guide institutionwide decision-making — or at least why, when they do proffer strategic plans or mission statements, the results are often anodyne.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Universities are organized to hold contradictions, not to resolve them. Typical academic decision-making processes manage the ambiguities that multiple goals create in lieu of picking winners in the underlying conflicts. That works well in normal times, but it is disastrously bad for reaching, communicating, and acting on common priorities under threat. Yet universities’ public missions may now require them to do just that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Prominent conservatives generally agree that hardball tactics are necessary to compel desired changes in academe. JD Vance advocated for “honestly and aggressively” attacking universities. Leo Terrell, who heads the Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, wants financial pressures “to bring these universities to their knees.” As the conservative commentator Heather Mac Donald puts it: “The concept of academic freedom should be scaled back to allow funders — especially taxpayers — a say in how universities are run, including in what is taught.” The activist Christopher F. Rufo believes “existential terror” will provide the leverage needed to make an ultimatum stick: “Reform, or lose billions in funding.” That threat is now being carried out, and the administration’s will to back it up has been on clear display. As Robert Kelchen put it, “Every revenue source is at risk.” Federal research grants and contracts are just the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Columbia example shows that the decisions institutions targeted by the Trump administration face have far-reaching, complex implications that take them far outside the standard mechanisms of academic leadership. The most easily defensible choice for any institution may be to protect its interests by negotiating for the best individual deal. But, as one Harvard professor pointed out, “that might be quite bad for higher education as a whole.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Harvard case has, so far, revealed this administration’s willingness to flip every policy lever available to them to reshape universities. It suggests a more complex landscape and more wrenching decisions are in store — choices that will certainly pit a university against itself, further fragmenting and undermining coordinated responses.</p>

<p>Populists are anti-intellectual. President Trump isn’t pumping research money into the universities; he’s draining it out. The administration is not tripling the National Science Foundation’s budget; it’s trying to gut it. The administration is trying to cut all federal basic research funding by a third, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<p>“One reason the U.S. economy had such a good Cold War was that the American university had an ever better one,” the historian Hal Brands writes in his book “The Twilight Struggle.” Federal support for academic research rose to $1.45 billion in 1970 from $254 million in 1958. Earlier in that century, American universities lagged behind their “best” European peers, Brands observes; by the end of the Cold War, they dominated the globe.</p>

<li>New Report on the State of Academic Governance in Community Colleges</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>At most responding institutions, and especially at responding institutions with tenure systems, faculty authority is consistent with AAUP-recommended governance standards in decision-making about programmatic, departmental, and institutional curricula; teaching assignments; salary policies; and faculty searches, evaluations, and tenure and promotion standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>However, in several decision-making areas, including budgets, buildings, provost selection, and strategic planning, community college faculty have few meaningful opportunities to participate. In these areas, community colleges deviate from the principles set forth in the AAUP’s 1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities, which emphasizes faculty involvement in personnel decisions and budget preparation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Statistically significant differences in the level of faculty authority between unionized and nonunionized colleges appear in only three of the twenty-six areas, a finding that mirrors that in the AAUP’s 2021 Shared Governance Survey of four-year institutions. Specifically, institutions where the faculty engages in collective bargaining have higher levels of faculty authority in areas related to salary policies teaching loads, and, in the case of community colleges, full-time non-tenure-track faculty promotion decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Across most areas of academic and personnel decision-making, levels of faculty authority are lower at community colleges than at four-year institutions. However, faculty members at community colleges have more involvement in salary policies than those at four-year institutions; the difference is likely related to the higher prevalence of institutions with collective bargaining in the community college sector.</p>

<li>Texas just gutted free speech on college campuses. Is your state next?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/07/14/texas-campus-free-speech/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/07/14/texas-campus-free-speech/</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Across the country, state legislators have been racing to exert new influence over free expression in higher education. Now, Texas has surged to the forefront, closing its 2025 legislative session by passing two alarming laws that take effect Sept.&nbsp;1.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the new laws amount to a stunningly aggressive legislative crackdown on campus protest (S.B. 2972) and academic shared governance (S.B. 37) at public colleges and universities. The laws will not just silence dissent and undermine faculty authority in Texas; they provide a blueprint for how to dismantle academic freedom and chill speech on campus state by state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now, some of the same legislators have done an about-face. The campus protest law actually directs public colleges and universities to implement a version of free-speech zones and adopt sweeping limitations on protests. Encampments? Banned. Megaphones or speakers during “class hours”? Forbidden — if anyone claims your “expressive activity” is one that “intimidates others” or “interferes” with an employee’s duties. Even wearing a mask during a protest — something many do for safety — could land a student or employee a disciplinary hearing resulting in “sanctions.” And any expressive activity between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. is off-limits altogether.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>State law defines “expressive activity” as “any speech or expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment” — speeches, writing, art, symbolic actions, even just talking to your friends. It’s problematic enough that legislators seek to prohibit nighttime or early-morning protest activity, but the language could affect late-night art events, student journalists, and even assigned research, course or thesis work for students or faculty in the habit of burning the midnight oil. The new law is so absurdly broad it could theoretically be used to stop a group of students from discussing politics on a campus bench at night. That’s not security; it’s suppression.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And this is just half the story.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The second new law in Texas is an outright power grab dismantling shared governance, the cornerstone of U.S. higher education. Typically, higher education institutions have democratic systems to share power and foster collaboration among administrators, governing boards and faculty. Faculty senates, whose members are typically elected by faculty, exercise authority over curricular matters, academic policies and graduation requirements. In addition, they often play a role in general institutional decisions, such as related to planning, budgeting or the evaluation of administrators.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Texas legislature obliterates these traditions, stripping faculty of any meaningful decision-making role in how their institutions are run. Under this law, faculty senates at public universities and colleges can now exist only if permitted by the institutions’ governing boards — the oversight bodies whose members are politically appointed by the state governor. In mockery of democratic principles, half of the faculty senate members must be chosen by the university president, and administrators can remove faculty for not conducting their duties within vague “senate parameters.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To make matters worse, the law installs a governor-appointed “ombudsman” with sweeping enforcement powers. This political appointee will be charged with monitoring compliance with state laws and can recommend that a public university or college lose all state funding unless it complies.</p>

<p>The Joint Associations Group, or JAG, which includes the Association of American Universities (AAU), the American Council on Education (ACE), and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), announced its proposal on Friday. The coalition sees its plan as a middle ground, one that responds to long-held gripes about how indirect costs are administered while lessening the billions in lost revenue for universities under the 15-percent indirect-cost cap proposed by several federal agencies, among them the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Departments of Defense and Energy.</p>

<p>Universities are an easy target for right-wing populists. Polls show that a lot of Americans consider them too liberal, too expensive and too elitist, and not entirely without reason.</p>

<p>Today, the biggest beneficiary could be China and Chinese universities, which have been trying to recruit world-class scientific talent for years. Now Mr.&nbsp;Trump is doing their work for them. One indication of the success of China’s campaign to attract the best and brightest is Africa, the world’s youngest continent. Africans are learning Mandarin in growing numbers. Nearly twice as many study in China as in America.</p>

<p>Could America gamble away its scientific supremacy in the service of ideology? It has happened before. Under the Nazis, Germany lost its scientific edge to America in the space of a few years. As a German, my brain may wander too readily to the lessons of the 1930s, but in this case the analogy feels instructive. Several of my colleagues covering the fallout from the crackdown on international students and researchers pointed to Hitler’s silencing of scientists and intellectuals.</p>

<p>I don’t sense a big change in the mood in India yet. The United States still holds a lot of soft power and remains very attractive to Indians. In fact, many Indians are seeing something that is pretty familiar to them. They’re saying, “Welcome to the world as we have experienced it for the past few years.” The government under Narendra Modi has definitely cracked down on free speech. It has tried to quash dissenting voices, and it has also leaned on academics and has tried to squeeze certain research institutions that it considers too liberal. And there has been a demonization of the Muslim minority, which make up about 15 percent of the population. There are a lot of similarities to Trump’s America. Everyone in the world is just trying to understand what Trump’s actions mean for their own countries. So India’s experience can be instructive in making sense of this moment.

<p>China really wants to become a center for international education, because it sees that as a key ingredient for building its reputation as a global superpower. American universities have long been a source of American soft power. China wants Chinese universities to be a source of Chinese soft power. And now Trump is doing their work for them. You can see that in China’s rhetoric and messaging. It’s trying to portray itself as open and international, everything that the Trump administration is turning away from.

<p>(“his” What about just saying weaponizing …)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>President Donald Trump and his allies are using a little-known but powerful corner of higher education — college accreditation — to exert pressure on colleges and universities, an effort that threatens the independence of accreditors and the stability of the institutions they approve.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This week, the Education and Health and Human Services departments encouraged Harvard University’s accreditor to take action against the Ivy League school for allegedly violating the civil rights of Jewish students. The New England Commission of Higher Education, which accredits Harvard, said it has given the university until Aug.&nbsp;15 to respond and will take up the matter at a previously scheduled meeting in September.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The administration took a similar step in early June over Columbia University’s alleged civil rights violations. By the end of June, Columbia’s accreditor, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, issued the school a noncompliance warning. Middle States did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It’s unusual for [the Office of Civil Rights] to directly involve itself in accrediting matters,” said John R. Przypyszny, a lawyer who specializes in accreditation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While the Trump administration has no direct control over whether the schools remain accredited, it could punish accreditors for failing to act by stripping them of the authority needed to operate. And a recent move by the Education Department is raising questions about whether the administration is dangling that possibility over Harvard and Columbia’s accreditors.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A day after notifying Columbia’s accreditor of the Ivy League school’s alleged violations in June, the Education Department postponed a meeting of the federal advisory committee that oversees accreditors from July to October. The 18-member committee was scheduled to vote this summer on whether Middle States and the New England Commission should remain certified to accredit colleges.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By the time the committee meets this fall, the terms of six of its members will have expired. The House, Senate and education secretary take turns appointing members, and this time the secretary will fill all six seats. That gives the Trump administration a chance to select people who are aligned with its ideology on higher education.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It seems like they’re trying to fix the vote,” said Robert Shireman, a member of the committee who is also a senior fellow at the left-leaning Century Foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Several committee members said the Education Department flouted the rules of the panel, which says only the chair can set a meeting schedule. When Zakiya Smith Ellis, who assumed the role of chair in February, pointed that out, she said the department told her it did not recognize her as chair because she took over the position when the previous chair resigned.</p>

<li>Despite Reservations, Florida Approves New Accreditor</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The decision came after about an hour of heated discussion between board members and the State University System of Florida’s chancellor regarding details of the plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Chancellor Raymond Rodriguez argued that the new accreditor, called the Commission for Public Higher Education, would eliminate the bureaucracy that comes with existing accrediting agencies and focus specifically on the needs of public universities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The Commission for Public Higher Education will offer an accreditation model that prioritizes academic excellence and student success while removing ideological bias and unnecessary financial burdens,” he said. “Through the CPHE, public colleges and universities across the country will have access to an accreditation process that is focused on quality, rooted in accountability and committed to continuous improvement.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But before voting in favor of the motion, board members repeatedly pushed back, arguing that the plans for starting an accreditor from scratch were half-baked.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Last week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement served subpoenas to Harvard with sprawling demands that included payroll records, years of disciplinary files and any videos Harvard had of international students protesting on campus since 2020, according to two people familiar with the subpoenas, some of which were reviewed by The New York Times. The agency gave the university a breakneck one-week deadline for compliance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Also this month, the administration formally accused the school of civil rights violations, arguing that Harvard had failed to protect Jewish people on campus. The government also complained to the university’s accreditor, which could eventually jeopardize Harvard students’ access to federal financial aid.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harvard leaders are well aware that a long fight with the government is perilous, threatening jobs, projects, reputations and academic independence. Some inside the university have feared that civil inquiries could become criminal matters.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Before the lawsuit, the administration sent Harvard an extraordinary list of conditions, including new policies on hiring, admissions and faculty influence, compulsory reports to the government and audits of academic programs and departments. Since then, although officials acknowledged that sending the letter was a mistake, the government has barely budged from the demands.</p>

<p>The existence of a potential deal was confirmed by a third person, who, like the others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive negotiations.</p>

<p>(Methinks this may be a planted story to put pressure on Columbia, but what do I know.)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A university spokeswoman on Friday night did not confirm details of the deal or the potential White House meeting. “The university is focused on advancing the discussions with the federal government. There is no resolution at this time,” the spokeswoman, Virginia Lam Abrams, said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The deal could include $200 million or more in compensation paid by Columbia for alleged civil rights violations. Columbia officials are expected to meet with Trump aides next week at the White House to finalize the deal, said one of the people familiar with the discussions.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And Harvard, despite its litigation, has also restarted talks with the Trump administration regarding the return of billions of dollars in federal research funding that have been cut.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The current draft of the deal, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and The Free Beacon, does not go as far in exerting federal authority over the university as an earlier version that was circulated in April.</p>

<p>Ms.&nbsp;Shipman announced that the changes would include formally incorporating the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism into the work of a recently established office at Columbia that considers complaints of discrimination and discriminatory harassment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In addition, Columbia will appoint two new coordinators to oversee investigations into claims of discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Those coordinators will produce a publicly available report each year about discrimination investigations and their results.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The university will also institute new educational programs about antisemitism for students and faculty and staff members, including those developed by national organizations such as Project Shema, a training and support organization, and the Anti-Defamation League. And it will reaffirm that it has zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment based on protected traits, including Jewish and Israeli identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Joseph Howley, a professor of classics and supporter of the pro-Palestinian movement on campus, was critical for different reasons. The definition of antisemitism being adopted by the university, he said, “is not informed by scholarly expertise or even best practice. So it’s not the best framework for confronting hate speech, and it’s not going to solve real problems of discrimination or harassment.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To do the same thing over and over and expect a different result is one definition of insanity. According to Robert Shibley, a special counsel of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), it’s also Columbia University’s approach to addressing anti-Semitism on campus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On Tuesday, Claire Shipman, Columbia’s acting president, announced in an email to the community that the university would take several steps to quell anti-Semitism on campus. Columbia will appoint Title VI and Title VII coordinators to review allegations of discrimination. It will launch new programming around anti-Jewish discrimination, send out regular messages affirming its zero-tolerance policy on hate, and use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of anti-Semitism for certain disciplinary proceedings. In her message, Shipman promised that the university would continue making reforms until it had stamped out anti-Semitism. “In a recent discussion, a faculty member and I agreed that anti-Semitism at this institution has existed, perhaps less overtly, for a long while, and the work of dismantling it, especially through education and understanding, will take time,” she wrote.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The message was notable for how closely it resembled the communications that university presidents have previously sent out about other forms of discrimination. Replace the references to “anti-Semitism” with “racism,” and Shipman’s message could practically have been lifted from the statements of summer 2020</p>

<p>Now, the mission has gone off the rails: The Trump administration is coming for George Mason University, one of Virginia’s largest colleges, which has done more than almost any other campus in the country to become conservative-friendly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Sadly, George Mason’s course will likely be determined not by its president or faculty, but by politicians in Richmond and judges in courtrooms. A Fairfax County judge is expected to rule later this month on a move by Democrats in the Virginia Senate to block approval of Gov.&nbsp;Glenn Youngkin’s (R) nominees to the school’s board.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Today, we are seeing a profound shift in how Title VI is being applied,” he wrote. “Longstanding efforts to address inequality—such as mentoring programs, inclusive hiring practices, and support for historically underrepresented groups—are in many cases being reinterpreted as presumptively unlawful.

<p>The moral of those two stories is that the smartest approach to college may be precisely the one that its trajectory of late has conspired against: range widely across subject offerings and focus not on a skill that could become obsolete but on intellectual dexterity and powers of judgment with better odds of enduring relevance. “A liberal arts degree is a preprofessional degree — you just don’t know what the profession is,” said Zimmerman, who teaches a seminar for first-year students at U. Penn. called “Why College?”</p>

<p>But higher education as a blessing independent of any instantly redeemable credential bucks the zeitgeist. Under Trump, blunt materialism reigns, and such concepts as human rights, diplomacy and even democracy are suspect, the precious preoccupation of idealistic chumps. Do anthropology, philosophy and history stand a chance?</p>

<p>(As Krugman noted in a recent newsletter: “So in modern Republican rhetoric, anything to the left of MAGA ideology is communist extremism. And here’s the thing: The answers you get from AI generally don’t adhere to the right-wing party line. … it all goes back to Stephen Colbert’s dictum, almost 20 years ago, that “reality has a well-known liberal bias.” )</p>

<p>The order would dictate that AI companies getting federal contracts be politically neutral and unbiased in their AI models, an effort to combat what administration officials see as liberal bias in some models, the people said.</p>
