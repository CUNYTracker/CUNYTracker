<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Trump’s assault on the left combines the use of the available tools of violent conflict — the military, the Department of Homeland Security and ICE in particular — with the prosecution of critics (and people he just doesn’t like), cuts of essential funds for liberal institutions, the use of regulation to threaten businesses with bankruptcy, the criminalization of free speech and the blackmailing of corporate America into obedience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The assault has become increasingly brutal as Trump and his allies intensify their demonization of all things left of center, by which they often seem to mean anything to the left of the hard right.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Trump and his allies seized upon Kirk’s assassination to justify a sharp acceleration of their attacks on the left, which, along with a number of other commentators, I was worried about from the start. Now it’s getting worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard who has been closely tracking movements on both the left and the right, showed no hesitation in declaring that Trump and his allies “are trying to provoke protests and demonstrations that they can call ‘violent’ even if there are fewer destructive elements than after the usual big football victory or loss.”</p>

<p>Everyone I contacted for this column described what Trump is doing as a clear violation of democratic rules and guidelines governing peacetime activities.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Regrettably, the administration has continued to seek ways to impose its own ideologically driven vision for higher education through unilateral executive action and the coercive use of public funding. On October 1, it invited a first cohort of university leaders to sign a “compact” that would commit their institutions to the vigorous pursuit of the administration’s priorities. The compact is, in effect, an ultimatum: sign and receive “multiple positive benefits,” including “substantial and meaningful federal grants,” or retain the freedom to “develop models and values other than those” of the administration, and “forgo federal funding.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This is not constructive engagement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In renewing the call for constructive engagement, AAC&amp;U also strongly opposes any alternative that would erode or eviscerate essential freedoms and promote instability by making America’s colleges and universities subject not to the law and the principles that have served us so well for centuries, but to the changing priorities of successive administrations.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This is not a policy framework. It is a political tool meant to reshape governance at these nine institutions and, if successful, to serve as a model for the rest of higher education. It also comes at a time when dozens of universities already are under investigation by the Office for Civil Rights and the Department of Justice, turning what is labeled “voluntary” into something much closer to coercion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What is being proposed here is entirely different. It is not a bargain among equals but a one-sided set of conditions imposed by the federal government. Calling it a compact is deliberately misleading.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In truth, this document looks more like a consent decree — the kind of settlement imposed by a court when an institution violates federal law. Consent decrees typically follow litigation, require judicial approval, and are tailored to remedy specific violations. Here, courts have been bypassed entirely. This compact dictates broad rules on admissions, hiring, free speech, international students, and tuition. For the nine universities, signing would be a preemptive surrender clothed as voluntary compliance. It has the binding force of a consent decree but lacks all of the necessary safeguards.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The risks are enormous. The compact requires annual certifications from presidents, provosts, and admissions directors, effectively embedding the Departments of Justice, Education, and Homeland Security in the routine decisions of universities. Even unintentional noncompliance could require repayment of all federal funds received in a year and the return of private gifts if donors demand it. For a research university, a single disputed admissions decision or a protest deemed to violate loosely defined standards of political loyalty or “incitement” could trigger financial catastrophe.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The chilling effect on academic freedom would be significant. The compact authorizes the reorganization or closure of academic units that are considered to privilege certain viewpoints. Vague references to “anti-American values” and “incitement” could easily interfere with protected activities like scholarship, debate, or protest. Combined with the threat of severe financial penalties, this would lead to systemic self-censorship. Tenure would become worthless if entire departments could be shut down for ideological reasons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Mr.&nbsp;Trump will fail in remaking American politics if people and institutions coordinate against him, which is why his administration is targeting businesses, nonprofits and the rest of civil society, proposing corrupting bargains to those who acquiesce and punishing holdouts to terrify the rest into submission.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As political theorists like Russell Hardin have explained, power is a “coordination game,” in which everything depends on what the public believes and does together. Even the most brutal tyrant does not have enough soldiers and police officers to compel everyone to obey at gunpoint. Authoritarian regimes need civil society — the realm of people and organizations outside government control — to acquiesce to their rule. East Germany’s dictatorship collapsed when multitudes began to march and organize against it, collapsing the illusion that everyone accepted tyranny.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The struggle over regime change is about whether the aspiring authoritarians can subdue civil society. Their strategy is to play divide and conquer, rewarding friends and brutally punishing opponents. They win when society cracks, creating a self-enforcing set of expectations, in which everyone shuts up and complies because everyone expects everyone else to shut up and comply, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Universities have taken note. Although the Trump administration forced Columbia into humiliating subjection and has won some concessions from other universities, it hasn’t succeeded in creating the general sense of self-reinforcing hopelessness in the academy that it wanted to. Some institutions are negotiating, but few seem on the verge of folding to the same degree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that depends on fear of a credible threat. The administration would have played its cards differently if it had a stronger hand. … That this didn’t happen suggests that the administration’s threats aren’t enough on their own to compel submission.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On October 1, the Trump administration sent letters to nine universities asking them to sign a Compact for Academic Excellence with the federal government. This compact contains demands that are a direct attack on university autonomy and academic freedom. Beyond this, it crystallizes a problem with both the administration’s claim that there is insufficient “viewpoint diversity” in the universities and with the steps they demand be taken to address it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It is worth dwelling on the framing of viewpoint diversity within the document. In general, writing by the Trump administration does not repay close reading. But its inexactness and ambiguity is sometimes part of the point; the scope of what is being demanded is deliberately unclear or directly contradictory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>My point is somewhat different. “Viewpoint diversity” is reifying. It reduces scholars to static ideological viewpoints. It imagines that individuals occupy identifiable political positions aligned with stable and explicit beliefs that do not change over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Despite the misleading openness of the term “broad spectrum,” this directive asks the university to categorize its faculty, staff, and students in the manner that a naturalist classifies flora and fauna. It is then expected to publish (presumably anonymized) results, and then actively hire or admit individuals so as to broaden or complete the spectrum.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This investment in the empirical ideological classification of the living members of an academic community is incoherent, even bizarre. The whole point of an academic community is to engage in forms of inquiry that are open and unfolding, mutable and contestable. This is the whole point of being human, too. The idea that an academic has to register their political affiliation, in the manner one might register one’s political party, is anathema to the vocation of learning, teaching, and research.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What can be made to matter at present for academic freedom and for civic life is the conscious and active cultivation of habits that we are particularly well suited to protect and extend: a habit of ongoing inquiry; habits of direct argument and disagreement; habits of noninstrumental questioning and study. And in that context not everything has to be a litmus test about the flashpoints this administration has decided to impose on us. As Hannah Arendt said of thinking itself, cultivating habits of thinking may be decisive in those moments when the chips are down. Our very mode of conduct as academics is counter-authoritarian. Authoritarians want fixity, and they project it onto their opponents, but we remain open to change, self-critique, and revision. This is why we are seen as a problem — and we can take strength from this fact in each moment of our practice.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I am purposefully “belittling” a “conservative idea.” Or maybe I am not. I’m not really sure what the legal threshold of “belittling” is, and while I have a pretty good idea which ideas should be considered “conservative” (I studied American conservatism in graduate school with one of the premier historians of the subject), I am pretty sure McMahon does not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s important to note that this intervention into higher education is unlike the previous mob-like extortion moves on Columbia, Harvard, the University of California, and (again) my own University of Virginia. In those, the Trump administration told these universities they had to make specific changes in how they do their work or who runs the university under the threat of losing substantial research funding—regardless of the public value of that research.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This “compact” is more like an invitation to borrow money from the mob, with substantial control and future penalties assured. If any university agrees to this proposal, it will be under federal control and subject to some unpredictable, arbitrary, extreme penalties.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now, those who work at the Department of Education should probably know that every major, nonreligious, and state college and university in the United States has had policies protecting academic freedom since the 1950s, when state and federal leaders frequently purged faculties of professors who studied or proclaimed positions that ran counter to the mainstream values of the time. Academic freedom policies came from faculties, not the government. Governments are the enemies of academic freedom, not their protectors. This current administration is the greatest threat to academic freedom and scientific research since the ebb of McCarthyism. And this compact is just more evidence that it wants to dictate what we teach, what we research, what drugs we develop, and how we express ourselves.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The result of this shifting, amorphous justification for the terminations has been devastating to Clemson’s academic environment. Faculty, staff, and students no longer know what types of speech will be tolerated or punished. The larger upshot is a classic chilling effect — when people hold back from speaking because the boundaries of acceptable expression are unclear and the risks of reprisal too high. Reliance on elastic terms like “inappropriate” or “disruptive” leaves the community guessing what might cost them their jobs or their professional reputations. The result is self-censoring and silence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But it’s not just that our colleagues tell us that they are now much more cautious about what they say in class. They are also surreptitiously recording their lectures — insurance, they tell us, in case they get accused of saying something they didn’t say or their words are taken out of context. “I’m scared and I’m a tenured professor.” It goes the other way too: Faculty have learned that their lectures are being recorded without their permission and, understandably, think that students are “out to get us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Across these cases, universities appear less guided by consistent standards than by external outrage. Terms like “disruption,” “misalignment,” or “institutional values” function as catch-alls, invoked only after political actors or social-media campaigns generate pressure. The result is a chilling effect in which speech protections hinge not on content but on who objects and how loudly. This dynamic illustrates the broader breach in the academic social contract, where institutions increasingly forfeit public trust by applying principles inconsistently and privileging short-term reputational management over enduring commitments to truth and civic responsibility.</p>

<p>Months after Jim Ryan stepped down as University of Virginia president, state Sen.&nbsp;Creigh Deeds is still waiting for answers on whether political interference and external pressure played a role.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But so far, university lawyers have largely refused to answer the state lawmaker’s questions, citing ongoing investigations. Faculty members have also said they can’t get straight answers from the university or face time with the board.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Jeri Seidman, UVA Faculty Senate chair, said the board has declined to answer faculty questions about Ryan’s resignation and DOJ investigations. She added that the board has been less responsive since the Faculty Senate voted no confidence in the Board of Visitors in July.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Recent Faculty Senate resolutions include demands for an explanation on Ryan’s resignation, the no-confidence vote and calls for UVA leadership and the board to reject the proposed “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Virginia Democrats have also opposed the compact and threatened to restrict funding to the university if it signs on. That threat comes as lawmakers are ratcheting up pressure on UVA and waging a legal battle to block Republican governor Glenn Youngkin’s board appointments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Surovell warned that “the General Assembly will not stand by while the University surrenders its independence through this compact” and that there would be “significant consequences in future Virginia budget cycles” for UVA should the Board of Visitors agree to the arrangement.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Between 2002 and 2022, the percentage of students surveyed who said they expected to earn a bachelor’s degree or higher fell from 72 percent to 44 percent, according to a research brief the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Education published Tuesday.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The decline in college aspirations among first-generation students is deeply concerning,” Kimberly Jones, president of the Council for Opportunity in Education, which oversees the Pell Institute, said in a news release. “These students have long faced systemic barriers to higher education, and this data underscores the urgent need for renewed investment in outreach, support, and affordability—including through programs like TRIO and the Pell Grant.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But in his quest to shrink the size of the federal government, President Donald Trump has proposed cutting funding for TRIO—a set of federally funded programs that support low-income, first-generation college students and students with disabilities as they navigate academic life.</p>

<p>Faculty from the City University of New York system discuss ways to empower and educate students on climate, sustainability and green careers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hands-on work: CUNY has a variety of experiential learning partnerships in New York City that help translate climate research into insights for students and community members and make them aware of the issues impacting their city.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One example is the New York City Climate Justice Hub, which invites community members to set research agendas that would best serve their neighborhoods, such as investigating urban heat or improving sustainable transportation options, said Michael Menser, an associate professor of philosophy and urban sustainability at Brooklyn College.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The system also offers training for community members to engage in climate action themselves. Kingsborough Community College conducts free training programs in renewable energy and sustainable technology for environmental justice and disadvantaged communities, said Robert Zandi, associate director of renewable energy programs at KCC. Students enrolled in these programs receive wraparound supports, career navigation support and Metro cards to boost their success, Zandi said.</p>
