<p>Interview with Larry Diamond</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Right now, if you are not at a university, if you’re not at a law firm, if you are not a member of Congress who is getting death threats and warnings of political obliteration if you don’t vote in lockstep with the MAGA movement, if you are not a journalist getting abuse and potential exclusion from the government, if you’re not a career Foreign Service officer or a civil servant who has dedicated their lives to serving the country in nonpartisan fashion and you’re now being purged or fired — if you’re not any of those kinds of people, your life goes on, except maybe you’re paying higher prices or seeing your 401(k) fall because of Trump’s erratic policies on tariffs. So, you can say that, in terms of the loss of freedom, most people feel unaffected. But what we need to get our fellow citizens to see is that it’s all connected, and that when due process is undermined even for a noncitizen, ultimately it can put everyone’s freedom in jeopardy. What lessons do you draw from other countries such as Hungary, India, Poland, Brazil, the Philippines, Turkey and Venezuela, all of which have seen democratic backsliding over the past few decades?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p> The lessons are that people should unify and coordinate as quickly as possible. The more that institutions under threat try to just go their own way or duck for cover, the more they’ll be divided and picked off one by one. The sooner that people rally in coordination and in principled defense of the Constitution and the rule of law, the better the prospect that they will be able to contain and reverse the authoritarian project.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Timothy L. O’Brien, a biographer of Mr.&nbsp;Trump, said the president’s ire about the upper echelon of academia was not surprising. “He has a long track record of criticizing elites that he desperately wants to be accepted by,” Mr.&nbsp;O’Brien said. As far as the Ivy League, he said, “he could barely wait to get in himself.”</p>

<p>Conservative lawmakers, who control all levers of government, are advancing a measure they say would hold institutions more accountable and ensure curriculum is “free from ideological bias.” Faculty could be removed or face civil penalties for violations. Schools that fail to comply could be barred from spending state funds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Opponents say the result would essentially be a takeover of the state’s 126 public universities, community college districts and medical schools, with state officials even allowed to overturn hiring decisions. They fear it could damage the institutions’ reputations and lead to a faculty brain drain.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>His (Brandon Creighton) new proposal aims to decrease the power of faculty senates, requiring that half of their members be appointed by school presidents. All would be term-limited, advisory only and removable by top administrators for “political advocacy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Another provision would give the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board — composed of nine gubernatorial appointees — the ultimate say in faculty and academic screening. The board would pay special attention to schools’ required core curriculum, to ensure they “do not require or attempt to require a student to adopt a belief that any race, sex, or ethnicity or social, political, or religious belief is inherently superior.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Complaints lodged against professors would be investigated by a new state ombudsman and the attorney general, currently Ken Paxton (R), an ultraconservative Trump ally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Texas is as broad-reaching a legislative endeavor as we’ve seen,” he (Professor Peter Lake, Stetson University) said. And combined with Trump’s attacks on higher education, the legislation is likely to “embolden red states to experiment with even more control over institutional autonomy, right down to curriculum, hiring and firing, tenure, curriculum review.”</p>

<li>What Trump’s Proposed Budget Cuts Mean for Education, Research (aims to cut at least $163 billion)</li>

<p>(I’d argue even phrasing this as a planned cut, rather than merely an assault is a mistake, but….)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The proposed budget plan slashes nearly $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health, $12 billion from the Education Department and nearly $5 billion from the National Science Foundation. The skinny budget also eliminates funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, AmeriCorps, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has already made deep cuts at those agencies and put most—if not all—of their employees on leave.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To compensate for the cuts to programs that directly support students or institutions, the administration argued colleges, states and local communities should on take that responsibility. Other justifications for the cuts reflect the administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and higher ed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Again, “crackdown” is far too fair a term here.)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Additionally, the administration wants to cut the Office for Civil Rights’ budget by $49 million, or 35 percent. The budget document says this cut will refocus OCR “away from DEI and Title IX transgender cases.” In recent years, the Biden administration pleaded with Congress to boost OCR’s funding in order to address an increasing number of complaints. The office received 22,687 complaints in fiscal year 2024, and the Biden administration projected that number to grow to nearly 24,000 in 2025.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The budget cuts funding for: climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and programs in low priority areas of science,” the officials wrote in budget documents. “NSF has fueled research with dubious public value, like speculative impacts from extreme climate scenarios and niche social studies.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(There is too much there to even unpack; I’ll just note that this was preceded by “we must change course and reorient taxpayer dollars toward proven programs that generate results for American students.”)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The plan would consolidate NIH programs into five areas: the National Institute on Body Systems Research, the National Institute on Neuroscience and Brain Research, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Institute of Disability Related Research, and the National Institute on Behavioral Health.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The administration is committed to restoring accountability, public trust, and transparency at the NIH,” officials wrote. “NIH has broken the trust of the American people with wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In South Dakota, the OCR abruptly terminated its work with a school district that had agreed to take steps to end discrimination against its Native American students. The same office that helped craft the agreement to treat indigenous students equally made a stunning about-face and decided in March that helping Native American students would discriminate against white students.</p>

<p>Investigating cases that allege racism, discrimination based on sexual orientation or mistreatment of students with disabilities now requires permission from Trump appointees, according to a memo from OCR leadership.

<p>The Trump Administration expects affirmative action for conservative viewpoints:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Each department, field or teaching unit must be individually viewpoint diverse,” the letter said. So too must be the student body, staff and leadership. A failing grade, the letter warned, would result in corrective measures, including the deliberate recruiting of “a critical mass” of new faculty and students to correct the imbalance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harvard has rejected the Trump administration’s demands, calling them a threat to academic freedom and the political independence of higher education. But in a letter to Harvard affiliates informing them that the university was suing the government, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, echoed that vocabulary.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“We acknowledge that we have unfinished business,” Dr.&nbsp;Garber wrote. “We need to ensure that the university lives up to its steps to reaffirm a culture of free inquiry, viewpoint diversity and academic exploration.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harvard itself has been a hotbed of diverse views about the value of viewpoint diversity and its relationship to the bedrock value of academic freedom. But there’s broad agreement that the Trump administration is weaponizing the term — which its letter never defines — in a dangerous way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The term viewpoint diversity began gaining currency across academia largely through the efforts of Heterodox Academy, a nonpartisan national group founded in 2015 to combat what it describes as “the rise of closed-minded orthodoxies within scholarly communities.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In recent years, it has been picked up by Republican politicians, as a new tool to support their longstanding argument that universities have been taken over by the left.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“When the secretary says, ‘Don’t come to us for grants anymore,’ she means that, and she can enforce it,” said Adam Kissel, a visiting fellow in the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Education Policy. “The tone suggests that Harvard really needs to wake up and understand the dire nature of its situation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But by and large, this is the take they find</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, described Monday’s letter as a “particularly disturbing” and “unwarranted escalation of threats.” What the Trump administration has done since day one, Pasquerella said, is launch a “politically motivated attack, not only against Harvard, but higher education as a whole,” and it’s all part of a long-standing Republican playbook.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Multiple Inside Higher Ed sources have described the Trump administration’s approach to higher education as “fascist” or “authoritarian,” and Pasquerella even noted that the White House has positioned Viktor Orbán—Hungary’s right-wing prime minister who has long been known for his assault on academic freedom—as someone to emulate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The president is so bombastic and so over-the-top that it’s hard for me to see gradations,” Hess [director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank] said. “So, sure, the secretary sending a letter that declared ‘don’t bother applying for anything’ is an extraordinary declaration. And in other circumstances, I would have been like, holy cow. But given what the administration has done over the past three and a half months, it’s not clear to me that it changes the administration’s posture.”</p>

<p>McMahon’s letter displays an astonishing and frankly disqualifying level of ignorance — about Harvard, about how federal research funding works, and about the plain text of the U.S. Constitution,” Weld (AAUP President of Harvard chapter) said. “The entire higher ed sector must reject this crude authoritarianism with one voice.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The intensely hostile letter that Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent to the leadership of Harvard yesterday has a lot going on. But the most notable thing about it is what it leaves out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To hear McMahon tell it, Harvard is a university on the verge of ruin. (I say McMahon because her signature is at the bottom of the letter, but portions of the document are written in such a distinctive idiolect—“Why is there so much HATE?” the letter asks; it signs off with “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”—that one detects the spirit of a certain uncredited co-author.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What you will not find in the McMahon letter is any mention of the original justification for the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on elite universities: anti-Semitism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now, however, the mask is off. Aside from one oblique reference to congressional hearings about anti-Semitism (“the great work of Congresswoman Elise Stefanik”), the letter is silent on the subject. The administration is no longer pretending that it is standing up for Jewish students. The project has been revealed for what it is: an effort to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal.</p>

<p>But behind the scenes, several senior officials at Harvard and on its top governing board believe that the university is confronting a crisis that could last until President Trump is out of power, according to three people involved in the discussions.

<p>They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss school officials’ private deliberations.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The crosscurrents are unlike any that the university has faced in its modern history.

But Mr.&nbsp;Trump has reveled in unleashing chaos that many believe will be difficult to contain as long as he sees the university as a target.</p>

<p>The corporation [the board that oversees the university] has told the school’s lawyers not to engage with the Trump administration, according to the two people involved in discussions.</p>

<p>Complicating matters is whether the White House will honor a deal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Lawrence H. Summers, a former Harvard president, said … “It would be a tragedy if Harvard resolved this in a way that gave support and encouragement to the idea of extralegal extortion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Trump administration this week reiterated its aim to inflict as much damage as possible, when Ms.&nbsp;McMahon fired off a letter telling Harvard that it would not receive future federal grants. Although experts on government contracts and grants scoffed at the missive, the government can essentially blacklist contractors through a process called debarment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Aside from the research funding, there will be nothing to stop the administration from saddling the school with more onerous and potentially costly investigations, like the ones currently being conducted by at least five different departments and agencies, including the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>In April, I decided to make public a leaked letter from the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to the editor-in-chief of CHEST, a leading pulmonology and critical care journal. I did so because the letter represents an authoritarian threat to science, and I knew it wasn’t an isolated, bizarre incident. It is a warning sign, another move in a broader campaign to exert control over research, medicine and media.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The letter asserts that “publications like CHEST Journal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates.” It was written by recently appointed acting U.S. attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr., who gives no examples that might demonstrate partisanship; nor does he cite any laws or legal principles to indicate a matter that should concern the U.S. government.</p>

<p>Why CHEST? It’s a specialty outlet—not even among the top 50 medical journals. Is this a keyword-driven campaign like those we’ve seen at the CDC and NIH? Under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., terms like “diversity,” “minority” and “equity” have been systematically flagged.</p>

<p>Fried echoes this sentiment. “I spent 40 years in the State Department, and you didn’t collect names or demand email records,” says Fried. “I’ve never heard of such a thing”—at least not in the American context, he clarifies. It did remind him of Eastern European “Communist Party minder[s] watching over the untrusted bureaucracy.”</p>

<p>American higher education leaders, advocates and stakeholders must stand together to “defend the autonomy of college and university governing boards as a cornerstone of constitutional freedoms; and reject political interference that undermines academic excellence and fiduciary stewardship,” the group said.</p>

<li>A Looming Crisis for Public Colleges: If the federal government cuts Medicaid spending, state funding for higher ed will evaporate.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/a-looming-crisis-for-public-colleges">https://www.chronicle.com/article/a-looming-crisis-for-public-colleges</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The House Republicans’ plan for reconciliation includes a cut of about $880 billion over the next decade in health-care and energy spending and $230 billion from agriculture. A budget reduction of this magnitude will require significant reductions to Medicaid and SNAP.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>That would directly harm low- and moderate-income Americans across the country, but these costs will also be passed on to states, putting pressure on already-tight budgets. And, as history has shown us time and time again, a state-budget squeeze almost always leads to skyrocketing college costs and lower-quality public education.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Most states are required to pass balanced budgets each year. But some programs, like Medicaid, are directly tied to formulas and federal matching dollars. When revenue is tight, especially in tough economic times, states reduce the portion of their total budgets that remain “discretionary” — the portion that is not dictated by formula-derived expenses.  In almost every state, higher education is the largest discretionary-spending category.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For just one example, look to Pennsylvania, where I [Tanya I. Garcia] previously served as deputy secretary and commissioner for postsecondary and higher education. For the 30-year period from financial year 1991 to financial year 2021, Pennsylvania increased Medicaid spending by 227 percent and decreased higher-education spending by 28 percent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When state funding for higher education drops, it affects open-access, less-selective colleges the most, since they are more dependent on state appropriations and less able to raise their prices than their peers at elite public and flagship institutions. This is a crucial distinction, as 86 percent of all undergraduate students pursuing a degree in the United States do not attend selective flagships or research universities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Make no mistake: Such massive federal funding cuts would unleash mayhem on state budgets and public colleges starved for resources. Almost 40 states will have finalized their budgets by June 30 of this year. Will we have a raft of states calling special legislative sessions to revise their budgets when all is said and done in the nation’s capital? We still have time to avoid this.</p>

<li>NYTimes: I Know Trump’s Plan for Universities. It Transformed My College.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Trump has been watching what’s transpired in Florida. The architect of Project 2025’s education policies has said that Florida is “leading the way” on university overhauls. Already, Mr.&nbsp;Trump has threatened to pull funding from colleges that don’t purge language he considers woke. He’s demanded new oversight of certain regional studies departments. Next he could try to ban, as Florida has, “political or social activism.” He could weaken the protections provided by tenure and faculty unions. I saw this happen on my campus, and I know the toll it took. If the Trump administration has its way, my experience could offer a preview of what’s coming for other universities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Since Mr.&nbsp;DeSantis’s crackdown, I’ve seen my colleagues harassed and investigated for addressing topical issues, even outside the classroom. The climate of fear gives the government precisely the result it wants. Administrators and faculty members alike practice anticipatory obedience to avoid even the appearance of wokeness, stifling the sort of open and civil discussions that lead students to develop their own views.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Several professors have been subjected to efforts at entrapment. Last year a man posing as a student tried to encourage Muslim faculty members to criticize Mr.&nbsp;DeSantis and Israel. A similar incident happened to me. … That incident shattered my conviction that if I did my job well and followed the rules, I would be safe.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Teaching is, above all, the creation of a community in the classroom, a web of trust and curiosity that binds students and instructors in a shared intellectual project. Mistrust, fear and self-censorship make that project impossible.</p>
