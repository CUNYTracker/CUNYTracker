<p>CUNY – and higher school education more broadly – is a public good that is well worth the investment of public dollars.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>CUNY is an engine of social mobility.</p>

<p>Equally vital to this mission is the work of CUNY faculty, whose research spans disciplines and directly addresses pressing social, economic, scientific, and cultural challenges.</p>

<li>A different take on academic freedom.</li>

<p>(Thanks BE for sharing)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Rather than an individual right, academic freedom is, properly understood, what Stanley Fish called “a guild concept.” More specifically, it is a concept belonging to the incorporated guild of professors and students (and others). This theory bases academic freedom not on freedom of speech—a troublesome basis for academic freedom—but on the university’s corporate rights. These corporate rights, not infrequently finding expression in constitutions, are also sometimes constitutional rights. By substituting corporate rights for freedom of speech, we turn a foundation of sand into stone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that, in spring 2025, we may have entered the nadir of American academic freedom. Austin Sarat rightfully urged us, even before then, to find new ways to guard academic freedom “against external threats.” Now, in the face of ongoing hostility from both state and federal governments, it is imperative that universities deploy the full range of arguments at their disposal, including those based on their forgotten corporate rights. In other words, it’s time for universities to invoke their corporate rights. Allow me to explain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Incorporation,” David Ciepley has written, “is a powerful tool.” Corporations can sue and be sued in their own names, hold property, enter contracts, use their own seals and legislate. Importantly, the university’s corporateness bears no necessary relationship to its current autocratic constitution, whereby, according to Timothy V. Kaufman-Osborn, universities are “ruled by external lay governing boards vested with the panoply of powers customarily granted to corporations, including the power to adopt, amend, and revoke its basic rules of institutional governance.” Thus, we can use the university’s corporateness to rebuff external attacks, while also working, as Arjun Appadurai wrote recently, “to break the unilateral power of boards of trustees.”</p>

<p>The Trump administration has declined to release nearly $7 billion in federal funding that helps pay for after-school and summer programs, support for students learning English, teacher training and other services.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The money was expected to be released by Tuesday. But in an email on Monday, the Education Department notified state education agencies that the money would not be available.</p>

<li>A Decades-Old Government Program That Supports Hispanic Students Is Under Fresh Scrutiny</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For 30 years, colleges enrolling a certain share of Hispanic students have been able to secure a title that opens up millions in federal funding. Hundreds of them now qualify as Hispanic-serving institutions, or HSIs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But those programs are now in the line of fire.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The U.S. Education Department doled out about $350 million to Hispanic-serving institutions in the 2024 fiscal year across three competitive grant programs; the National Science Foundation awarded another $53.5 million. Colleges can become eligible when at least 25 percent of their undergraduate students identify as Hispanic or Latino/a.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Students for Fair Admissions, the group responsible for the lawsuit that ended race-conscious admissions policies at selective colleges in 2023, has brought a new complaint in Tennessee arguing that federal funding designated solely for HSIs is discriminatory.</p>

<p>Three months ago, DOGE employees wrested control of a key federal grants website, grants.gov, which serves as a clearinghouse for more than $500 billion in annual awards, The Post reported. For most of the program’s existence, federal agencies including the Defense Department posted their funding opportunities directly to the site, where thousands of outside organizations could see and apply for them — until April, when DOGE staffers changed the website’s permissions to give themselves power to review and approve all grants across the government.</p>

<p>But on Thursday, federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, according to emails obtained by The Post and the two people, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive situation.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Duke receives around $1.2 billion in research grants a year, and much of it comes from the NIH. In fiscal year 2024 NIH support totaled $580 million.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Most of the time, that’s a point of pride, a marker of success, but it’s also a point of challenge when that fundamental model is changing. This is what we’re dealing with now,” said Mary Klotman, executive vice president for health affairs and dean of the School of Medicine</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Grant Watch contains a field for “tagged_words” — which matches words from a list that The New York Times reported could trigger an automatic review of grants — to words used in a grant’s title or abstract. Noam Ross, a computational researcher part of Grant Watch, told The Chronicle that Grant Watch doesn’t know exactly how grants are flagged for termination, but “suspect that these words are part of a search process for selecting them based on [The New York Times article] and other reporting.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The 15 canceled NIH grants contained flagged words like “expression,” “disability,” “trans” and “systemic.” However, these words were not used in contexts to promote DEI initiatives, although some may have had diversity supplements including the two described below.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The grant that had the word “disability” in its abstract focused on identifying biomechanical and biological factors that lead to early onset osteoarthritis following a partial meniscectomy — a surgical procedure commonly done to remove damaged meniscal tissue following a tear. The grant had over $750,000 remaining in funding at the time of termination.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Furthermore, a grant that had both “trans” and “systemic” in its abstract was working toward editing neural circuits by engineering channel proteins to control the point of contact between two neurons. It had around $1.4 million remaining in funding at the time of termination.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In most other cases where “trans” was flagged, the term generally referred to other words with the trans- prefix, such as disease transmission, transgenic genetic material, translational studies or signal transduction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Most notably, the NIH ended Duke’s Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development, which was a $129 million program and a leader in its field. The program was in its sixth year of funding out of seven and was largely expected to be renewed for an additional cycle. Associated funding has not been listed as terminated in federal databases and thus was not included in the Grant Watch data analysis.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Should the bill become law, it would contain some bitter pills for higher ed, too: an increased excise tax on the endowment income of wealthy colleges, penalties for institutions that fail to deliver an earnings bump to their graduates, and the elimination of Grad PLUS loans.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But while advocates for the sector and its students decry those provisions, they may have dodged more damaging bullets. The Senate legislation underwent significant changes in the week leading up to its passage, several of which softened provisions in the House bill that had raised alarms across the sector. The Senate retained the House’s broad plan to raise the endowment tax, for example, but it limited the extent of the hike and opened up loopholes for small institutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Senators abandoned a House plan to eliminate subsidized federal undergraduate loans. Also out: a House provision that would have required students to take 30 credit hours per academic year to receive the maximum Pell Grant award, and 15 credit hours to be eligible for Pell Grants at all. Community colleges were particularly panicked about the provision.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Senate kiboshed a controversial risk-sharing plan introduced in the House bill, which would have forced colleges to kick money into a new pot of federal aid when their students defaulted on federal-loan repayment. Instead, it offered an alternative approach with roots in the gainful-employment rule, a cornerstone of the Obama administration’s accountability efforts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Senate-passed plan would yank federal-loan eligibility from programs that fail to deliver an earnings bump to their graduates. Senators tweaked the details in the days leading up to Tuesday’s vote so colleges would be judged on the earnings of their graduates, not dropouts.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Under investigation by the Justice Department, the university had a strong defense, if only it had the courage to assert it. Instead of fighting back against what I believe to be false accusations that the university was violating federal law, and the even more outrageous demand that Mr.&nbsp;Ryan resign as a remedy for those alleged violations, the university’s Board of Visitors pushed out a popular president. Instead of presenting facts and law, the board waved the white flag of surrender. Mr.&nbsp;Ryan’s resignation is a victory for intimidation and fear over the rule of law.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I served as university counsel at the University of Virginia from 2018 through 2022. During that time, it was my job to defend the university from unfounded allegations and investigations. The Justice Department has alleged that the university’s actions violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which states, “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” Had I been university counsel last week, I would have advised my client to challenge what I believe to be a false allegation that the university’s policies are unlawful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Title VI prohibits racial classifications, quotas or programs that are exclusive to any one race, gender or protected class. It does not prevent federal contractors, such as universities, from pursuing the goal of creating a diverse community, one that ensures all individuals can participate in the learning environment regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, national origin or political ideology. Eligibility for programs and opportunities based on those and other immutable characteristics is illegal. Programs that create a pipeline of diverse applicants are not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While the university’s compliance with Title VI is clear to me, it was challenged by the Justice Department. Informed by the advocacy of the America First Legal Foundation, an organization founded by the current White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, the department alleged that the university’s compliance efforts were insufficient, a mere relabeling of D.E.I. programs that broke the law. The department’s proposed remedy was the resignation of the university’s leader — a shocking move that reveals the personal animus behind the investigation. The administration would rather oust a leader than force compliance with a particular policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Why? By law, the university and all state agencies are represented by the attorney general of Virginia. The current attorney general has been an outspoken opponent of D.E.I. programs. He joined Virginia’s governor, Glenn Youngkin, in applauding the university’s dismantling of D.E.I. programs in March 2025. This means rather than having an advocate loyal to the university and its interests, Mr.&nbsp;Ryan and the university were saddled with counsel aligned with the other side.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The university’s governing board took a similar position. The majority of the current board was appointed by Mr.&nbsp;Youngkin, who has said, “D.E.I. is done at the University of Virginia.” In failing to assert these valid legal defenses, the board abdicated its responsibility to protect the university and defend it against unfounded allegations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Ryan was known to urge the university to be both “great and good” in all its endeavors. His departure will result in a less inclusive university community, which will harm all students who choose the University of Virginia. It is a sad day for the university, which will suffer the consequences of this bad decision.</p>

<p>In a letter to Harvard’s president, Alan M. Garber, on Monday, officials from four federal agencies said that the university was “in violent violation of Title VI,” a portion of federal civil rights law that bars discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin. In recent years, government officials have interpreted the provision to include “shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics” as within the law’s protections.</p>

<p>In their letter, the Trump administration officials said that Harvard’s “commitment to racial hierarchies” had “enabled antisemitism to fester” at the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harvard sharply disputed the government’s account, saying in a statement on Monday that antisemitism was “a serious problem” that the school had taken significant steps to address.

<p>But Paula M.

<p>The cyberattack that caused a widespread shutdown of Columbia University’s computer systems last week appears to be the work of a “hacktivist” — a hacker who also stole student data with the apparent goal of furthering a political agenda, a Columbia official said on Tuesday.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A cyber-forensics firm hired by the university reported that the hack appeared to be highly sophisticated and targeted in its theft of documents, the official said. The official added that Columbia had not yet determined the scope of the data theft and that it could take weeks to months to do so.

<p>Indiana Public Universities to ‘Voluntarily’ End 19% of Degrees</p>

<p>(Their quotes, not mine. Thanks VAC for sharing.)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Indiana’s public higher education institutions plan to eliminate or consolidate over 400 programs, equaling roughly one-fifth of their degree offerings statewide, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education said Monday. The announcement came just before a new state law took effect Tuesday setting minimum requirements for how many graduates individual programs must produce at the universities and Ivy Tech Community College, or face termination.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Republican state legislators passed the law—a state budget bill with major higher education provisions tacked on—less than two days after revealing it in April. It says institutions can ask the commission for approval to keep offering degrees that don’t meet the threshold of average annual graduates. But the universities “voluntarily submitted” the first wave of hundreds of programs to be ended or consolidated, the commission said, meaning they didn’t ask for exemptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>According to a list posted by the commission, among the 400 degrees to be nixed or combined into others are many foreign language and teacher-education programs. The list also includes undergraduate and graduate degrees in fine arts, English, business, economics, philosophy, history, anthropology, sociology, journalism, public administration, social work, labor studies, political science, American studies, Africana studies, women’s and gender studies, religious studies, and classical studies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>STEM and medical disciplines aren’t being spared, either; the eliminated or consolidated degrees include some in health, biology, chemistry, math, computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. Indiana University at Bloomington, for instance, is ending its Ph.D.&nbsp;in astrophysics. More than half the programs to be eliminated or merged are in the IU system. Vincennes University is the only public institution in the state that didn’t “voluntarily” submit programs to be cut or combined.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Indiana’s program slashing can be seen as another consequence of the broader push by red states’ legislatures to intervene in higher education by restricting teaching, attacking tenure and, now, dictating curricula.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Heather Akou, the president-elect of the IU Bloomington Faculty Council, said the council didn’t get to vote on these “draconian” cuts and mergers at the flagship campus. “Not only did we not vote, we were not even consulted with,” Akou said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Balthaser, the IU South Bend AAUP member, said, “This was done very intentionally to essentially change the mission of the university—to shrink it, to essentially destroy what we understand as the public [land-grant] university.”</p>

<p>I am writing, with a very heavy heart, to let you know that I have submitted my resignation as President of the University of Virginia.

<blockquote class="blockquote">

<p>Ryan’s ouster has turned UVa into an unexpected battlefield in the Trump administration’s political assault on colleges. For months, officials have wielded federal power to rebalance what they see as higher ed’s extreme leftward tilt and stamp out diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harmeet K. Dhillon, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, sees things differently. Ryan “has built his entire career on what was the academic vogue, which is DEI. Now, it isn’t,” she told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “And so I think it is time for new leadership that’s willing to comply with federal law.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Other faculty members see Ryan’s decision as a submission to political actors who have no inclination or tendency to compromise. The professors wish that Ryan, or the university, had fought back. Deborah McDowell, a professor of English, thinks Ryan should have forced the board to fire him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Capitulation is sometimes in order,” she said. “For this, I don’t think it was. This is spoken as someone who does not agree and would not represent myself as one in full agreement with the decisions Ryan has made throughout his presidency. I am not. But bullies cannot be placated. They are greedy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The targeting of UVa may seem somewhat arbitrary, the result of a random commonality in the curricula vitae of two of the nation’s top civil-rights officials. In May, The Chronicle reported a story teasing out the connections between Dhillon; her deputy, Gregory Brown, who attended UVa as an undergraduate and has sued the institution in the past over a civil-rights issue; the Jefferson Council, the conservative alumni group that has been calling on Ryan to resign for months; and the Board of Visitors.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The letter requested, among other documents, all admissions data broken down by race and ethnicity for the past five academic years, including applicant test scores, GPA, extracurricular activities, essays and admissions outcomes.

</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The reduction in international students presents a credit risk for universities heavily reliant on this demographic because of potential declines in tuition income, as international students typically pay full tuition fees,” the report states. “Additionally, with declining numbers of high school students over the next several years in the U.S. leading to fewer domestic students, universities intending to fill the gap with more international students may fall short.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Before Trump, the review process was based on merit and impact. Now, it’s like rolling the dice because a Doge person has the final say,” said one current program officer. “There has never in the history of NSF been anything like this. It’s disgusting what we’re being instructed to do.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Federal Reserve estimates that government-supported research from the NSF and other agencies has had a return on investment of 150% to 300% over the past 75 years, meaning US taxpayers have gotten back between $1.50 and $3 for every dollar invested.</p>

<p>“Disaster Looms”: Justice Jackson’s Warning for the Country – Mother Jones</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Once upon a time, there was a president who wanted to be king. His Congress was acquiescent. The high court approved. But lower federal courts held firm to the rule of law. Time and again, they blocked the president from seizing power and violating the nation’s laws. So the president turned to the justices on the Supreme Court for a favor: please stop these meddlesome little courts from getting in my way. And then one day in June, the Supreme Court granted his wish.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This is what happened on Friday in a case about birthright citizenship before the United States Supreme Court. The Trump administration’s blatantly unconstitutional executive order from January denying birthright citizenship to the children of certain classes of immigrants quickly ran up against lower court judges, who prohibited the Trump administration from violating one of the country’s most sacred Constitutional rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The Court’s decision is nothing less than an open invitation for the Government to bypass the Constitution,” Sotomayor warned. “The Executive Branch can now enforce policies that flout settled law and violate countless individuals’ constitutional rights, and the federal courts will be hamstrung to stop its actions fully.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Jackson warns, this decision has altered our system of government and, sooner or later, may destroy it. “Disaster looms,” she warns. If a court cannot command the executive to follow the law, then there exists “a zone of lawlessness within which the Executive has the prerogative to take or leave the law as it wishes, and where individuals who would otherwise be entitled to the law’s protection become subject to the Executive’s whims instead.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In this country, the Executive does not stand above or outside of the law,” Jackson writes. But her dissent is also a warning that this is becoming less true. A year ago, the Republican appointees exempted the president from the dictates of criminal law. Now, it suggests that even if a court finds the administration’s actions illegal or unconstitutional, it can continue to enforce them against those who haven’t challenged the action in court, either individually or as part of a class action. As a result, the president rises beyond the bounds of the law, and individuals slip from the embrace of its protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I have no doubt that, if judges must allow the Executive to act unlawfully in some circumstances, as the Court concludes today, executive lawlessness will flourish, and from there, it is not difficult to predict how this all ends,” Jackson wrote. “Eventually, executive power will become completely uncontainable, and our beloved constitutional Republic will be no more.”</p>

<p>The study, conducted by researchers at Columbia University, found that ACE students’ five-year graduation rate was 11.7 percentage points higher than the rate of students who were eligible for, but not enrolled in, the program.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The researchers also calculated that the net social benefits for each participant in the program equal about $48,000—or $3.06 per taxpayer dollar spent on the program—most of which comes from the students’ increased earnings.</p>
