<p>“At this moment in our country’s history where communities of color are so much under attack and immigrant communities are so much under attack, CUNY is absolutely more important than ever,” said Barbara Bowen, former president of the Professional Staff Congress, CUNY’s faculty and staff union. “I am very concerned that having a mayor with that history of lack of support and active undermining of CUNY would be especially dangerous at this political moment.”</p>

<li>Trump Opens Up Compact to All of Higher Ed. Now What?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On Sunday, President Trump told his 10 million followers on Truth Social that, “tragically,” higher education in this country has lost its way, and he touted his administration’s efforts to fix it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Trump’s open invitation to colleges to sign on to the document did not come as a surprise. Several experts predicted such a development, and a White House official told Inside Higher Ed last week that other institutions had already reached out. However, the timing of Trump’s post raised some eyebrows.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The administration is reading the writing on the wall that they wouldn’t be able to run the table on the nine and that there would be substantial pushback,” said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education. “And they didn’t want to own that, so they looked for more buyers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But who signs will affect how the document is viewed and the message it sends.</p>

<p>“Depending on the names, it might wind up looking more like Walgreens than some high-end boutique,” Hess said.</p>

<li>The Compact Calls for a Unified ‘F You’</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/columns/editors-note/2025/10/16/compact-calls-unified-f-you">https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/columns/editors-note/2025/10/16/compact-calls-unified-f-you</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Boards of trustees—not presidents—will make the ultimate decision whether to sign the deal. At the IHE event, one president at a public institution in a “candy apple–red state” said a trustee urged them to sign the compact to gain a competitive advantage on federal research funds. That decision might make sense from a business point of view, but it doesn’t for someone concerned about institutional autonomy. Two state lawmakers in Iowa asked the Iowa Board of Regents to join the compact “as soon as possible.” Several leaders said if their board of trustees or state leadership made them sign it, they would quit. But individuals quitting in protest won’t stop boards from signing the deal—they’ll just hire new leaders who will comply. Disruption at the leadership level harms the entire institution. Meanwhile, thousands of faculty and staff without F You accounts will be stuck at institutions that have agreed to the terms.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s very likely that some colleges will sign the compact, and that will erode the independence of the entire sector. Higher ed should look to media companies as a model of collective resistance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If ever there was a time for community colleges, independent nonprofits, public R-1s and the Ivy League to speak with one voice, it’s now. Trump’s compact compromises the foundations of higher education—free inquiry, academic freedom and institutional autonomy. The sector’s strength will be in a collective response, not individual presidents resigning in protest. Higher ed should pool its F You accounts and refuse the deal collectively.</p>

<p>On campuses and in Washington, professors and policymakers alike are weighing whether Mr.&nbsp;Trump, who has reveled in his campaign to upend higher education, has overreached.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Brown’s decision, in particular, is a case study of how the White House may have misjudged its own strength and academia’s nerve, especially once one of Mr.&nbsp;Trump’s top aides said that the nine schools initially chosen to consider the proposal were “good actors,” or could be.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The compact itself just so egregiously and blatantly violated our ability to function as the institution that we are right now that it is very easy for people to get fired up about it,” said Raya Gupta, a Brown freshman who helped organize opposition to the proposal on the campus in Providence, R.I.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The demands also reach farther, with conditions that include accepting “that academic freedom is not absolute” and pledging to potentially shut down “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle and even spark violence against conservative ideas.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“There are many colleagues who just think there is no way any president, with the possible exception of red state, public universities, could sign this,” said Michael P. Steinberg, the president of Brown’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It is not clear how the Trump administration will proceed if universities continue to reject the proposal. The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this article, though a spokeswoman, Liz Huston, warned after Penn’s announcement on Thursday that “any higher education institution unwilling to assume accountability and confront these overdue and necessary reforms will find itself without future government and taxpayers support.”</p>

<p>After the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill refused to proffer faculty course materials in response to an open-records request, UNC Greensboro officials made the opposite decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(CUNY syllabi have been FOILed)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In July, officials at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill determined that the documents are not automatically subject to such requests after the Oversight Project, founded by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, requested that the university hand over any course materials from more than 70 classes that contained one of 30 words or phrases, including “gender identity,” “intersectionality,” “queer” and “sexuality.” Officials ultimately denied the request, writing, “There are no existing or responsive University records subject to disclosure under the North Carolina Public Records Act. Course materials, including but not limited to exams, lectures, assignments and syllabi, are the intellectual property of the preparer.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The requested materials are protected by copyright policies, a UNC Chapel Hill spokesperson told Inside Higher Ed. “The university has a longstanding practice of recognizing faculty’s intellectual property rights in course materials and does not reproduce these materials in response to public records requests without first asking for faculty consent,” they wrote in an email.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It’s probably a matter of degree,” Stevens said. “Something that you post online for your class to read, it’s pretty hard to say those are not subject to [public records requests]. But on the other hand, the materials that you use to prepare to teach your class, but which are never published to anybody, are certainly, in my view, copyrightable and proprietary.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The opposing interpretations of the law from two universities in the same public system have left faculty confused and worried about their safety as right-wing groups rifle through course materials for any terminology they don’t like, usually related to gender identity, sexuality or race. Faculty members at Texas A&amp;M University, the University of Houston and George Mason University, among others, have been targeted and sometimes threatened on social media for their instruction and teaching materials. Bolton said he knows of several UNC Greensboro faculty members who have been doxed.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The compact’s demands that universities and colleges eschew foreign students with “anti-American values” and that they impose a politically determined diversity within departments and other institutional units are incompatible with the self-determination that colleges and universities must enjoy if they are to pursue their mission as truth-seeking institutions. So also is the compact’s demand that universities and colleges select their students only on the basis of “objective” and “standardized” criteria. Colleges may of course voluntarily elect exclusively to deploy objective criteria (such as standardized-test scores and high-school or college grade-point averages), but these standards should not be imposed on institutions which, operating within the law, wish to include consideration of nonquantifiable criteria in selecting students.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As recognized for over a century, faculty should be able to engage as individual citizens in extramural speech. Faculty should exercise these rights responsibly and professionally, but when they fail to do so, it is not the role of the government or the university to sanction them. Colleges that censor their faculty will quickly undermine the vibrancy and initiative so vital for teaching and research.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The power to punish extramural speech has been abused against both conservative and liberal speakers in the past. The requirement of the compact that universities and colleges censor students and faculty who voice support for “entities designated by the U.S. government as terrorist organization” imposes overly intrusive regulation of constitutionally protected speech.</p>

<p>Intellectual diversity and its analogues have been on the right’s agenda for 60 years. As Bradford Vivian observes in his book Campus Misinformation, “viewpoint diversity performs a deft linguistic trick,” modifying an old right-wing playbook of “unscientific partisan polemics” into a seemingly new and more palatable form. As scholars have analyzed, this ideology is propped up by pseudoscience (Vivian), error-ridden studies on supposed “liberal bias” (Charlie Tyson and Naomi Oreskes), discrimination claims that cannot “withstand serious scrutiny” (Sean Kammer), and “manufactured backlash” from a coordinated network of far-right think tanks (Isaac Kamola). The fierce attacks on the humanities and social sciences have an extensive history that were never rooted in a dispassionate critique of the dangers of groupthink. Demands for viewpoint diversity are simply the form those attacks take today.</p>

<p>Similar stories are playing out across the California State University system. Hispanic students account for almost half of the system’s more than 450,000 students. Out of the CSU’s 22 campuses, 21 are Hispanic-serving institutions, meaning they enroll at least 25 percent Hispanic students and at least half low-income students. In addition, 11 are AANAPISIs, which have the same low-income student threshold and enroll at least 10 percent Asian and Pacific Islander students.

Affordability continues to be a key concern for New Yorkers in every region of our state, creating pressures on the cost of food, healthcare, housing and energy. While revenues remain strong over the first half of the fiscal year, the forecasted growth will not be adequate to address structural gaps exacerbated by H.R. 1.</p>

<p>Penn’s president, J.

<p>The proposed agreement — which legal experts and civil rights groups have characterized as “blatantly unconstitutional” — faced immediate criticism following its announcement earlier this month.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The University of Virginia on Monday sent an online form to the campus community, asking survey takers whether there were aspects of the proposed “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” that they supported or opposed, and to explain their feelings. That input — due October 20, the deadline for UVa to provide feedback to the Trump administration — will be shared with the working group, responsible for examining “the financial and legal aspects of the proposal and its implications for the university’s mission and values.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>UVa’s interim president, Paul G. Mahoney, has acknowledged publicly that certain provisions in the document would be difficult for the university to endorse.</p>

<p>The Chronicle obtained the list of people advising Mahoney on the implications of the compact. The working group is co-chaired by UVa.’s interim provost and its chief operating officer and also includes the vice presidents for research, enrollment, and global affairs; the vice president and chief student-affairs officer; the vice president and chief financial officer; the executive directors for state and federal government relations; the dean of the public-policy school; the secretary to the board; and the university counsel.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While there is no faculty or student representative to the working group, Jeri K. Seidman, an associate professor of commerce and chair of the Faculty Senate, said she hoped there would be other ways to provide input beyond just the survey. “We have a lot of surveys going on right now,” she noted, as the university searches for both a permanent president and provost.</p>

<p>“Once you start saying some things are good and some things are not good, you’re conceding the principle that the federal government is allowed to tell university faculty and university students what they should think and teach,” said William I.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“She was very firm and clear on that, but it also had that very clear ‘as written’ part attached to it,” said that faculty member.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The administration has offered scant details about the benefits and how they might be conveyed to colleges that sign the compact, leaving institutional leaders to debate whether the document is an offer or a threat. Christopher F. Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, called Kornbluth’s rejection of the current compact “preposterous” in a Tuesday essay in City Journal, and encouraged the administration to “incrementally increase both the rewards for entering into the compact and the punishments for refusing.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hanlon, [Past president and faculty] at Dartmouth, said the fact that the agreement is now open to all colleges shouldn’t change any individual institution’s response. “It’s up to every campus to figure out where their red lines are and how they want to approach this compact,” he said.</p>

<p>A Texas district court judge on Tuesday ordered the University of Texas system to hold off on enforcing new, sweeping limits on student expression that would prohibit any “expressive activity” protected by the First Amendment between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The First Amendment does not have a bedtime of 10 p.m.,” wrote U.S. district court judge David Alan Ezra in his order granting the plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction. “Giving administrators discretion to decide what is prohibited ‘disruptive’ speech gives the school the ability to weaponize the policy against speech it disagrees with. As an example, the Overnight Expression Ban would, by its terms, prohibit a sunrise Easter service. While the university may not find this disruptive, the story may change if it’s a Muslim or Jewish sunrise ceremony. The songs and prayer of the Muslim and Jewish ceremonies, while entirely harmless, may be considered ‘disruptive’ by some.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>… in addition to prohibiting expression overnight, also sought to ban campus public speakers, the use of drums and amplified noise during the last two weeks of the semester. The restrictive policies align with Texas Senate Bill 2972, called the Campus Protection Act, which requires public universities to adopt restrictions on student speech and expression. The bill took effect on Sept.&nbsp;1.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Texas’ law is so overbroad that any public university student chatting in the dorms past 10 p.m. would have been in violation,” said Adam Steinbaugh, a senior attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, in a press release. “We’re thankful that the court stepped in and halted a speech ban that inevitably would’ve been weaponized to censor speech that administrators disagreed with.”</p>
