<h1>Jun 6</h1>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.</p>
<p>A week marked by more efforts to radically change higher education, this week by denying foreign students the ability to study in the US and in particular Harvard (though we now know what TRO means – temporary restraining order)</p>
<p>Thanks BE, EST for sharing!</p>

<p>Higher education is under attack. A coordinated political campaign is working to delegitimize universities, restrict what can be taught, punish open inquiry, and dismantle institutional autonomy. These efforts are already causing real harm—targeting international students, undermining financial aid, making it harder for many to access or afford a college education, and defunding life-enhancing research. They threaten the values that make higher education vital to democracy: free speech, academic freedom, inclusion, and the pursuit of knowledge. To protect those values, we must come together—across campuses, communities, and differences—in common cause.</p>

<p>Faculty may long for a break, but the government is actively operationalizing Project 2025, a blueprint for remaking every public institution, with higher education being the crown jewel of its antidemocratic agenda. At his 100-day rally in Michigan, Donald Trump declared, “We’ve just gotten started. You haven’t even seen anything yet.” Christopher Rufo, architect of the right-wing culture war, promises to plunge higher education still further into “an existential terror.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We should be prepared for a potential wave of coordinated assaults on higher education this summer: reductions in Pell Grant eligibility for low-income students and slashed student loans, more dismantlement of scientific research funding, politicized accreditation crackdowns, new endowment taxes, expanded intimidation of international students and scholars, and further weaponization of Title VI and Title IX enforcement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We recommend mobilizing on two simultaneous fronts this summer: by operationalizing mutual academic defense compacts (MADCs), and through direct activism. We must forge powerful alliances for mass protest. We suggest one often-overlooked but deeply strategic constituency— veterans.</p>

<p>The idea is central to Deneen’s [Notre Dame political-science professor] argument in Why Liberalism Failed, which announces America’s failed — past tense — liberal tradition. For Deneen, “liberalism” refers not just to the political beliefs of self-identified liberals or progressives, but also to the broader, rights-based political philosophy that has guided both major political parties for most of American history.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As Deneen was speaking, blueberry pie was served to an audience that included Rod Dreher, the well-known American Conservative blogger and author of The Benedict Option; Matthew Schmitz, an editor of the ecumenical religious journal First Things; and Bria Sandford, editorial director of Penguin’s right-of-center Sentinel book division. The next morning, the New York Times columnist Ross Douthat arrived</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the year and a half since the conference, other writers who have staked out public positions on the nonliberal right include the Harvard law professor Adrian Vermeule, the First Things editor R.R. Reno, the former Washington Examiner managing editor Helen Andrews, and the University of Dallas assistant professor of political science — and deputy editor of the journal American Affairs — Gladden Pappin. One might add Mary Ann Glendon, the Harvard law professor and former ambassador to the Vatican, who in July was named the head of President Trump’s Commission on Unalienable Rights.</p>

<p>The radicals, on the other hand, were those who believed that American liberalism had always been deeply hostile to the core values of Catholics.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harvard Law professor Adrian Vermeule accused Deneen of failing to grapple fully with the consequences of his own diagnosis. … What was needed was not the creation of new societies — which would survive only at the forbearance of the reigning powers — but a coup against the liberal “imperium” from within. … Rather than withdrawing from the power centers of liberal society, Vermeule recommends that administrators and other elites find a “strategic position” from which, as dissatisfaction with liberalism grows, they can turn that bureaucracy to “new ends.”</p>

<p>“A people that can no longer believe in anything cannot make up its mind,” said Arendt, a student of authoritarianism, in 1973. Eventually, such a public “is deprived … of its ability to think and judge”, and with people like that, “you can then do what you please”.</p>

<p>New laws in Ohio, Utah and Florida are reshaping general education, the core classes college students take to meet graduation requirements. The laws mandate that students take civics courses focused on Western civilization and bar classes centered on race or gender from counting toward core requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>State lawmakers have the authority to regulate curriculums and set requirements for graduation, but higher education experts say that until recently, they have let public colleges and universities lead the way. That began to change in 2020 after the first Trump administration issued an executive order to stamp out “divisive concepts” about race and gender in the federal government, according to the American Association of University Professors and American Federation of Teachers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“This is a new type of local intervention,” said Keith E. Whittington, founding chair of the Academic Committee of the Academic Freedom Alliance. “Some of the proposals are making more elaborate interventions about what the curriculum ought to look like and are also increasingly interested in the content.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But the meeting, which took place a week later on Zoom with Finkelstein’s lawyer present, was entirely about her repost. Finkelstein was told not to return to campus and locked out of her email. Her classes would be reassigned to an adjunct professor while the college hired an outside firm to investigate.</p>

This despite her having tenure, a historic form of academic job protection meant to insulate scholars from the steamrolling power of both politics and public opinion. Less noticed at the time, but arguably more prophetic, was how the mechanics of her firing trammeled yet another longtime standard in the academy, that of professors’ deciding among themselves when and if a colleague should be fired.</p>

And that’s not the only shake-up happening at the NSF, which Congress created in 1950 to “promote the progress of science; advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; and secure the national defense.” The Trump administration has also laid off staff and proposed slashing the agency’s budget.</p>

<li>Trump Escalates Attack on Columbia University by Threatening Its Accreditation - The New York Times</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/nyregion/columbia-trump-accreditation-civil-rights.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/nyregion/columbia-trump-accreditation-civil-rights.html</a></p>
<p>(Damned if you do, damned if you don’t)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The federal Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, which two weeks ago found that Columbia violated civil rights laws by “acting with deliberate indifference” toward the harassment of Jewish students, sent a letter on Wednesday to the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the nongovernmental organization that accredits Columbia.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The letter said that because Columbia was in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws, the Education Department believes it fails to meet the standards for accreditation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“University accreditors have an obligation to ensure member institutions abide by their standards,” Linda McMahon, the federal education secretary, said in a news release. She said the government looked forward to being “fully informed of actions taken to ensure Columbia’s compliance with accreditation standards, including compliance with federal civil rights laws.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>President Trump has described the accreditation process as his “secret weapon” to force ideological changes at universities. But the Trump administration does not have direct control over which universities are accredited. Instead, those decisions are made by nongovernmental organizations certified by the government, in a complex process meant to insulate universities from political interference.</p>

<li>No, Trump Is Not Pulling Columbia’s Accreditation. Here’s What You Need to Know.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/no-trump-is-not-pulling-columbias-accreditation-heres-what-you-need-to-know">https://www.chronicle.com/article/no-trump-is-not-pulling-columbias-accreditation-heres-what-you-need-to-know</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In terms of individual colleges, the federal government has no direct authority to interpret an accreditor’s standards, said John R. Przypyszny, a lawyer who specializes in accreditation. So Trump alone can’t revoke Columbia’s accreditation, which would cut off access to federal financial aid.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Education Department’s letter, sent Wednesday, argued that Columbia has violated the standards of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Because Columbia failed to adequately respond to antisemitic behavior during protests against the war in Gaza, the department’s Office for Civil Rights concluded last month, the institution has violated Title VI, which bars discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared Jewish ancestry. Therefore, the letter continues, Columbia “fails to meet the standards for accreditation,” the department said in a news release. In light of that, the department said, the Middle States Commission must require the university to “establish a plan to come into compliance.”</p>

<li>NYTimes: To Bolster Columbia Inquiry, Prosecutor Likened Hamas Graffiti to Cross Burning</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Justice Department, intent on pursuing a criminal case against student protesters at Columbia University, argued that graffiti with a Hamas symbol outside the home of the school’s interim president threatened her life and was comparable to a racist cross burning, newly unsealed court documents show.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The photo showed graffiti in bright red paint on the building where the university president lived, with the words “free them all” and an inverted triangle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(How freeing protestors becomes pro-Hamas, I’ll leave for others, but the article mentions an accompanying instagram post.)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The records also underscore how determined the Trump administration was to press forward with a case judges viewed as weak. Justice Department leaders pushed for an investigation of a student group, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, but federal judges in New York rejected the administration’s efforts to get a search warrant four times, in what some veteran lawyers described as an unusually prolonged disagreement between federal prosecutors and the courts.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Republicans passed a new law that would require university boards to measure the productivity of tenured faculty. Faculty were downgraded to “advisory only” roles in university decision-making. Degree programs that graduated too few students would be closed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And at Indiana University, whose flagship campus in Bloomington is ranked among the nation’s top 100 schools, the state’s governor was given new power over the school’s governing board.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The moves align with a conservative playbook to reduce faculty power on campuses perceived by many on the right as bastions of liberal thought. This year, several other Republican-led states passed laws requiring reviews for tenured faculty and the reorganization of programs at public institutions that have low enrollment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Many faculty members see the Indiana bill as an attack on their university’s independence and part of an effort to restrict their own freedom to teach and speak. They read Dr.&nbsp;Whitten’s [President of Indiana University] silence as support for the changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Indiana’s experience has been emblematic of the pressures facing public universities. But several factors — an active protest movement on campus, a state with strong conservative leanings and Dr.&nbsp;Whitten herself, a leader at odds with many on her campus — have created especially tense conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Whitten’s administration acted almost immediately. The university called in the Indiana State Police, which stationed snipers on rooftops and arrested 57 people, including a handful of faculty members.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Snipers!!!)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Whitten and the faculty have long had a frosty relationship. Earlier that spring, more than 800 faculty member approved a vote of no confidence in Dr.&nbsp;Whitten. (More than 3,000 were eligible to vote.)</p>
