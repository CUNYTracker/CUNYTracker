<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As the beginnings of a pro-Palestinian encampment formed on Northwestern University’s Deering Meadow in April 2024, then-President Michael H. Schill faced three choices: let the encampment continue; bring in the campus police to break it up; or negotiate with the student activists.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But that quickly ran into a snag. Schill was wary of sending in Northwestern’s small police force, so he asked the Evanston Police Department for help. The night they were going to take action, Schill said, “the mayor of Evanston called me and said he would not be sending in the police. I said to him, ‘We have a mutual-aid agreement.’ He said, ‘You know, you can sue me if you want.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>So Schill took the third option: negotiation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But Schill’s remarks reflect the inescapable fact that the encampments that sprung up a year and a half ago are still haunting college leaders, particularly as Republican lawmakers apply aggressive scrutiny to campuses’ handling of antisemitism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In his interview, Schill told the assembled group of investigators and attorneys that negotiating was the only choice he had. “A lot of people find what we did distasteful. A lot of Jewish people in particular find what we did … distasteful,” said Schill, who is Jewish. “I then ask them what they would do. No one has given me — and I’ve had this conversation probably 300 times where we go through everything. I tell them, ‘What would you have done differently?’ And they just get frustrated because they don’t have another option, unless just let it go on forever, and they don’t like that either.”</p>

<li>NYTimes: Antisemitic Slurs Disrupt Queens College Zoom Lecture About Israel</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/nyregion/antisemitic-slurs-queens-college-lecture.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/nyregion/antisemitic-slurs-queens-college-lecture.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>An Israeli law professor was only minutes into her online lecture about the erosion of the rights of women and sexual minorities in her country on Monday when an eruption of hate and misogyny filled the screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Queens College event — which was happening over Zoom — was abruptly interrupted by what appeared to be a group of attendees who turned on their cameras and microphones and began yelling slurs, including “kill all the Jews” and “go back to Auschwitz.” Instead of faces on the screen, pornographic and disturbing images appeared, including pictures of dead bodies and video clips of male masturbation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The event, an annual lecture sponsored by the Center for Jewish Studies at Queens College, illustrated how even Israeli academics critical of the war in Gaza such as Professor Tirosh, a law professor at Tel Aviv University, are being hit with antisemitic attacks as they deliver their views, presumably because they are Israeli.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The lecture had been advertised online and was open to the public. In an email, a Queens College spokeswoman said an investigation had determined that one person had registered as multiple attendees, then exploited a wrongly configured screen-sharing setting in the Zoom lecture to make the disruption happen from all those accounts at once. The college added that it would take immediate steps to reinforce its security protocols to prevent future incidents. Another similar disruption, which happened earlier this month during a Zoom lecture about an archaeological expedition in Africa, was also being investigated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Though several antisemitic incidents were reported on campus in the past two years, Queens College has earned praise from Jewish organizations for its defense of Jewish students. It earned an “A” grade this year from the Anti-Defamation League for its efforts and initiatives to combat antisemitism, one of 11 schools in the nation to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(From Queens College)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Queens College has longstanding Zoom security measures in place to prevent unauthorized disruptions. These include: - Restricting screen sharing to the host only. - Requiring meeting passcodes and waiting rooms for all sessions. - Enabling authentication, requiring attendees to log in using verified CUNY credentials. - Disabling file transfers and private chat to minimize opportunities for disruption. Following these incidents, we are working to review these procedures with the college community to ensure that all online events are configured according to these security protocols.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In a video circulated on social media platform X, Thomas Alter, an associate history professor, can be seen talking during a Zoom meeting as part of the Revolutionary Socialism Conference, an online meeting organized by several socialist groups.

<p>The University of Oregon will lay off 60 employees in order to close a structural deficit, administrators announced Monday, but it will not eliminate any degree programs or terminate any tenure-track professors, as faculty previously feared.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The layoffs follow 57 others in June, administrators said; the university will also eliminate 59 vacant positions. The latest round will affect nontenure-track faculty, administrators, and staff. The university will also cut about $4.3 million in other expenses to eliminate a total of $29.2 million in recurring spending.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Administrators have said the structural deficit resulted from factors including out-of-state enrollment that was lower than expected, growing compensation costs, and anemic state funding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the weeks leading up to the announcement, faculty members pressed administrators to hold off on their plans, including holding an emergency meeting with the executive committee of the University Senate and gaining support from the American Association of University Professors and some state legislators, among other measures. University leaders announced in June that the Board of Trustees had directed them to put plans in place by mid-September to close a structural deficit of $25 million to $30 million. That timeline meant most of the budget deliberations took place over the summer, when many faculty members were off contract and off campus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The University of Oregon is not alone in struggling to implement shared governance. As many colleges around the country are working to close budget gaps, the question of what role faculty members should have in conversations about an institution’s future will emerge again.</p>

<p>We are currently governed by a leader indifferent to scientific consensus if it contradicts his political or economic interests, hostile to immigrants and intent on crippling the research universities that embody our collective hope for the future. The menace now is within. And with very few exceptions, the leaders of American universities have done little more than duck and cover.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In 1958, by a bipartisan vote, Congress passed and President Dwight Eisenhower signed the National Defense Education Act, one of the most consequential federal interventions in education in the nation’s history. Together with the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, it made America into the world’s undisputed leader in science and technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The N.D.E.A. reflected the widespread realization that something had to be done in schools and universities besides teaching students to hide under their desks. The country urgently needed more trained physicists, chemists, mathematicians, aerospace engineers, electrical engineers, material scientists and a host of other experts in STEM fields, and the government grasped that to get them would take a massive infusion of money pumped into schools and universities: roughly $1 billion, the equivalent of more than $11 billion today.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Until 1962, recipients of N.D.E.A. funds had to sign an affidavit affirming that they did not support any organization that sought to overthrow the U.S. government. But in one of those moments in which the right policy is chosen for the wrong reason, Southern segregationists in Congress, worried that some of the funds might be used to further desegregation efforts, added a provision stipulating that no part of the act would allow the federal government to dictate school curriculum, instruction, administration or personnel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>These transformations wound up playing a significant role in my own career. When I went back to Yale for graduate work, the N.D.E.A. funded my Ph.D.&nbsp;The government was not under the illusion that studying Shakespeare was rocket science. But Title IV of the act, calling for an increase in the number of university professors, extended support to the humanities as well as the sciences. Sputnik had turned out to include me in its orbit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Should the Trump administration settle for one-time fines, universities, chastened by the threats of the past few months, may yet recover their footing. But if, as seems entirely possible, the administration is determined to reshape the intellectual life and values of faculty members and students alike, then such recovery will be impossible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Why on earth would we abandon institutions that have genuinely made America great? Why would we squander the world’s admiration for this magnificent achievement of ours? Why would we put at risk laboratories that are working to cure cancers or perfecting artificial limbs or exploring deep space or testing the limits of artificial intelligence?</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One major reason is an emerging divide within the administration between aides eager to deliver President Trump a political victory by announcing a deal and those who contend the current framework is too favorable to Harvard. Some Trump advisers argue that one way to strengthen the agreement would be to subject Harvard to an independent monitor who would ensure compliance. Harvard has consistently opposed that idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Talks have also slowed in recent weeks with Cornell University and Northwestern University, although the reasons are unclear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The government’s tactics — cutting research grants, opening investigations and demanding hundreds of millions of dollars or more in settlement payments — have plunged campuses into financial and political crises. Some schools, like Columbia University, negotiated deals with the Trump administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The slowdown in talks with universities is a signal that the administration is still acclimating to the departure of May Mailman, who, as the White House’s senior policy strategist, was a driving force behind Mr.&nbsp;Trump’s pressure campaign. She stepped back from that position last month as part of a long-planned return home to Texas.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The National Institutes of Health began allocating some grants to Harvard in July to comply with a federal court ruling. But Department of Government Efficiency officials have quietly blocked all the funds at the last mile, withholding money because the University has not reached a settlement, according to four people familiar with the matter, including NIH staff.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The NIH resumed issuing some grants in mid-July to schools, including Harvard, that had been barred from receiving federal dollars under April guidance, according to an internal memo obtained by The Crimson. But officials from DOGE, the government cost-cutting group, used their control over the NIH’s payment system to keep the money out of researchers’ hands.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The extent of DOGE’s role in quietly obstructing NIH grant disbursements to universities — even after the agency was legally compelled to begin restoring some awards in July — has not been previously reported. And it suggests that, even in the absence of a formal stay or injunction, DOGE may use its power over federal payments to continue to quietly sidestep the Wednesday ruling that directs the Trump administration to reinstate the more than $2.7 billion in federal grants to Harvard that the administration froze or terminated in the spring.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed great negotiator, has fumbled at the bargaining table once more.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>He failed to intimidate India and China in trade talks, setting the stage for inflation to rise and for America’s greatest rivals to unite. His ingratiating groveling to Russian President Vladimir Putin was unable to bring about the ceasefire he promised—despite entering negotiations with the upper hand. Now, the “great negotiator” seems to have lost his cards again in his epic standoff with the world’s top-rated university.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For an administration that claims to be concerned about maintaining technological and scientific supremacy against international rivals, the political warfare on higher education makes no sense. As widely documented, American universities serve as the strongest engines for research, innovation, and economic growth. The direct, and indirect, economic impact of U.S. universities on the national GDP is significant and undeniable. Sectors that American schools underpin such as digital commerce, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence account for nearly half of the U.S. GDP, drive almost all GDP growth, and total twice the size of federal government spending.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the context of America’s trade deficit, universities are a major export for the U.S., and one of the few sectors in which we have a large trade surplus. Universities, particularly through the influx of international students, contribute significantly to the U.S. trade surplus, with international students contributing $44 billion to the economy and the trade surplus in education accounting for about 15% of total U.S. services trade surplus—comparable to the combined exports of soybeans, coal, and natural gas.</p>

<p>(The three writers on the Harvard beat who have been consistently premature, have this to add)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Trump administration says it will restart the flow of federal research money to Harvard University, following a judge’s ruling that a sweeping blockade of funds was illegal, according to five people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The New York Times.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harvard received at least one letter this week from the Trump administration saying that hundreds of grants were being restored, according to a person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private correspondence. Individual researchers have begun receiving notices from the government about restored funding, including an astronomy professor, whose $3.7 million NASA grant seems to have been resurrected.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It is possible that funding will be disrupted again, even if the government begins making payments. The Justice Department, for example, could seek a stay of last week’s decision by Judge Allison D. Burroughs, who sits on the federal bench in Boston, and ask the court for permission to suspend the funding once again while its appeal proceeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harvard officials were surprised by the development, and unsure whether the White House knew that federal agencies seemed set to restore Harvard’s money, according to a person familiar with the university officials’ thinking. They wondered whether the West Wing would intervene to cut the funding off again.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For over a decade, New York has worked to bring wind power jobs to Staten Island as part of an ambitious plan to establish the state as the biggest hub of offshore wind. A centerpiece of the effort, situated in the southwest of the island, is the Arthur Kill Terminal (AKT), an envisioned staging and assembly port.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But on Friday, the Trump administration’s Department of Transportation rescinded a 2022 $48 million grant supporting the project that had been funded by President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“There’s a lot of money invested in this industry already, and these companies can’t take the hit.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The construction of the facility would create 600 jobs, according to Charles Dougherty, AKT’s chief commercial officer, and once up and running, manufacturing work would sustain 100 to 150 jobs, all union. The project would also add nearly $400 billion in “direct economic impact” according to Empire State Development.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Bringing wind power to Staten Island, which has only voted for a Democrat presidential candidate four times in history, used to be a bipartisan project. Staten Island’s GOP representative, Nicole Malliotakis, has supported AKT, while boasting of the economic and environmental benefits of expanding wind power facilities in her district. She voted for Biden’s infrastructure package, and on Earth Day 2022 introduced legislation to create a program to share federal offshore wind revenue with states. In April, despite Trump’s order halting offshore wind development, Rep.&nbsp;Malliotakis petitioned the Army Corp of Engineers to nonetheless expedite the remaining federal permit for AKT. Her office did not respond to a request for comment, but after the Department of Transportation announced on Friday that it would pull its financial support of the terminal, Malliotakis told the Staten Island Advance she would push the agency “to get the funding repurposed to another maritime, port infrastructure or economic development project that would benefit Staten Island.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Beyond investments in infrastructure, local officials also worked to build the island’s workforce. Beginning in 2023, New York City’s Economic Development Corporation gave over half a million to the College of Staten Island to “train the next generation of professionals for offshore wind careers.” The day before the 2024 election, AKT provided the college another $1 million to develop a future offshore wind industry workforce.</p>

<li>The Rise of ‘Conspiracy Physics’</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/science/physics/the-rise-of-conspiracy-physics-dd79fe36?st=9CAcc5">https://www.wsj.com/science/physics/the-rise-of-conspiracy-physics-dd79fe36?st=9CAcc5</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This resentment of scientific authority figures is the major attraction of what might be called “conspiracy physics.” Most fringe theories are too arcane for listeners to understand, but anyone can grasp the idea that academic physics is just one more corrupt and self-serving establishment. The German physicist Sabine Hossenfelder has attracted 1.72 million YouTube subscribers in part by attacking her colleagues: “Your problem is that you’re lying to the people who pay you,” she declared. “Your problem is that you’re cowards without a shred of scientific integrity.”</p>

<li>States face massive new costs under Trump budget cuts</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/08/states-medicaid-snap-cuts-trump/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/08/states-medicaid-snap-cuts-trump/</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>States are scrambling to prepare for an unprecedented shift of costs and responsibilities under President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and spending plan, which will force them to make difficult decisions about cuts to state programs to offset the new financial burdens.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Unlike the federal government, states must balance their budgets each year. That means deep cuts and changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will require state legislatures and governors to cope with hundreds of millions of dollars in new costs each year.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The changes mean that about 10 million fewer people are expected to have health insurance over the next decade and 2.4 million fewer people are expected to participate in SNAP during an average month, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The bill also sharply limits the provider tax, which states collect from hospitals and other providers to boost Medicaid payments and receive federal matching funds. The change, along with others in the bill, will cause an additional $366 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending, according to the CBO.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Washington Post conducted a survey of all 50 states and the District of Columbia about how much they expected to incur in additional costs from the Republican bill, how many residents are expected to lose health care and access to food stamps, and what services might be cut as a result. Only 15 states and D.C. replied, with responses that varied largely along partisan lines. … Three GOP-led states — Arkansas, Ohio and North Dakota — said they did not anticipate cuts to other programs as a result of Medicaid and SNAP changes … Democratic-run states say the effects of the federal cutbacks will be severe, and several Democratic governors have said there is no way for states to backfill the scale of the cuts.</p>
