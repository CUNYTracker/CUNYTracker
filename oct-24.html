<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.</p>

<ul>
<li>UFS Executive Committee statement: Not This Compact</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We call on the Board of Trustees of CUNY and the Chancellery of the City University of New York to steadfastly resist any pressures to enter into this McMahon-Mailman compact or any similar compact which would undermine the mission and values of CUNY.</p>

<li>ACE: Statement by Higher Education Associations in Opposition to Trump Administration Compact</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/Statement-Trump-Administration-Compact.aspx">https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/Statement-Trump-Administration-Compact.aspx</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>​The Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education opens with the assertion that “American higher education is the envy of the world and represents a key strategic benefit for our Nation.” We wholeheartedly agree. Yet we are deeply concerned that the compact’s prescriptions threaten to undermine the very qualities that make our system exceptional.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The conditions it outlines run counter to the interests of institutions, students, scholars, and the nation itself. It would impose unprecedented litmus tests on colleges and universities as a condition for receiving ill-defined “federal benefits” related to funding and grants.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>That is why our associations, which span the breadth of the American higher education community and the full spectrum of colleges and universities nationwide, are unified in our opposition to the compact.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Vanderbilt University’s chancellor on Monday declined to explicitly reject or accept the compact, but pledged that his institution would “provide feedback and comments as part of an ongoing dialogue.” The University of Arizona declined to sign, but sent the administration its own statement of principles as a “contribution toward a national conversation about the future relationship between universities and the federal government.” Before ending his letter, Suresh Garimella, Arizona’s president, wrote: “I look forward to further discussion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The same day, Washington University in St.&nbsp;Louis also announced it would participate in that conversation. Though WashU wasn’t among the nine institutions to receive the compact — which has since been opened to all of academe — it did join a Friday meeting with Trump administration officials. Explaining the institution’s rationale, Andrew D. Martin, the chancellor, wrote in a letter to campus that, “It’s important for WashU to have a seat at the table for these discussions.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Whereas presidents for seven out of the nine original recipients of the compact explicitly stated they were declining to sign the document as written, Daniel Diermeier, Vanderbilt’s chancellor, wrote, “Despite reporting to the contrary, we have not been asked to accept or reject the draft compact. Rather, we have been asked to provide feedback and comments as part of an ongoing dialogue, and that is our intention.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Heuser had previously sent the Faculty Senate a letter urging a full-throated rejection of the compact. “The ‘Campus Compact’ is a troubling assault on the independence of higher education,” he wrote one day after White House officials sent the compact to college presidents. “It endangers academic freedoms, politicizes institutional policies, and threatens the diversity and rigor that define our universities.” Vanderbilt’s American Association of University Professors chapter, Faculty Senate, and students and alumni later put out their own statements backing rejection, with varying vehemence.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The GI Bill sits near the top of the list of government policies that helped make America great in the mid-20th century. The 1944 law’s generous provisions for returning World War II veterans, and especially its grants of free college tuition, paved the way for the creation of a huge new middle class of productive, educated citizens.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s this postwar period — the late 1940s, the 1950s and the early 1960s — that President Donald Trump is generally understood to be talking about when he vows to make America great again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Maybe it is the 1880s, but nevermind)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But there’s another reason that the GI Bill kicked off a period of American greatness. You’ll find it tucked into Title II, Chapter 4, where the law states: “No department, agency, or officer of the United States … shall exercise any supervision or control, whatsoever, over any State educational agency, or State apprenticeship agency, or any educational or training institution.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<p>But that’s not what is happening. Indeed, the golden age of strong and independent higher education appears to have come to an end. Today, the president who says he wants to make America great again by reviving the spirit of the 1950s and ’60s is presenting a very different offer to the nation’s colleges and universities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>According to the “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” proposed by the Education Department this month, colleges and universities will need to consent to a laundry list of federal control to receive substantial federal funding. Among those conditions: Schools would have to agree to a gag order prohibiting their faculty, staff and leaders from speaking about many political or cultural issues. They would need to enforce the Trump administration’s ideas about gender identity. Some institutions would need to offer free tuition to students who are studying the federal government’s preferred academic topics; all would be required to purge programs that the government says include incorrect thinking about political topics. The schools would be subject to price controls that are antithetical to the tradition of free markets. And all of these policies would be policed by the government, which could enact heavy financial penalties on schools it deemed out of compliance.</p>

<p>Let’s focus on matters of free expression and academic freedom by examining the compact in three broad categories: viewpoint diversity, institutional neutrality and student expression. …</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The compact requires “a broad spectrum of viewpoints … within every field, department, school and teaching unit.” What can this mean? Must a department of immunology have vaccine skeptics? Must an economics department have Marxists? Must a sustainability school have climate skeptics? Must a political science department have democratic socialists? In ironic contrast with the compact’s demand for a “commitment to rigorous and meritocratic selection based on objective and measurable criteria in the appointment process,” selecting faculty based on their beliefs to achieve a broad spectrum of viewpoints within every field puts ideology ahead of academic merit.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The flaw in the rankings lies in their failure to account for the central role of disruptive, nonviolent protest in the development of free-speech doctrine and a concomitant abandonment of bedrock First Amendment tenets. The history of the First Amendment reflects a long tradition of contentious political protests, including campus protests, in the United States. From labor unions’ so-called “free-speech fights” at the turn of the 20th century to the civil-rights sit-ins and antiwar demonstrations of the 1960s to the recent pro-Palestinian campus encampments, political dissent has often involved discordant and clamorous protests. They have provided the context for many of the leading First Amendment court decisions in the latter half of the 20th century.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>FIRE’s model of proper protest, conversely, is more akin to a polite debating exercise. … But political protest is rarely so limited to the solemn scenes evoked by Martinez and embraced by FIRE. It’s usually a group activity, sometimes in the form of mass demonstrations. It is often tumultuous, noisy, and disruptive. That’s the point. Disrupting ordinary routines, choreographed speakers, or other aspects of your daily programming is what protest is all about. The goal of protest is to direct your attention elsewhere, to the object of protest.</p>

<li>UT Austin Blocks Grad Student Assembly Political Speech</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Officials at the University of Texas at Austin blocked the Graduate Student Assembly from considering two resolutions against Texas state laws last week, arguing that the student-run body must follow institutional neutrality policies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Mateo Vallejo, a first-year master’s student and representative in the GSA for the School of Social Work, drafted two resolutions for the assembly to consider: one condemning Texas SB 17, which bans diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at Texas public institutions, and another against Texas SB 37, a state law that, among other changes, put faculty senates at public institutions under the control of university presidents and boards.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On Oct.&nbsp;10, GSA president David Spicer submitted the two resolutions to Associate Dean for Graduate Studies Christopher J. McCarthy for approval. According to the assembly bylaws, the dean of students’ office must approve all proposed GSA legislation before it can be considered by the full assembly, effectively giving the office an opportunity to veto, Vallejo explained. Once a bill is submitted to the dean’s office, the assembly cannot make any changes to the text. Vallejo, Spicer and the GSA vice president were careful to follow the bylaws during the drafting process to give administrators as little reason as possible to shut the resolutions down.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Spicer followed up, asking why the GSA was prohibited from engaging in political speech when others have done so in their official capacity at UT Austin. He pointed to an op-ed by Provost William Inboden in the conservative magazine National Affairs and a statement from University of Texas System Board of Regents chairman Kevin P. Eltife, who said the university was “honored” to be among the institutions “selected by the Trump Administration for potential funding advantages” under Trump’s “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Like attacks on the Faculty Council, silencing GSA through institutional neutrality is an attack on the notion of shared governance,” Spicer said in a statement to Inside Higher Ed. “GSA appoints students to university-wide committees and, previously, Faculty Council committees. GSA is the one space at UT Austin where students can voice issues impacting their graduate education.”</p>

<li>Amid Trump’s Assault on Free Speech, Advocates Stay Busy</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>ameel Jaffer, a civil rights litigator for more than 25 years, said there is no question that President Donald Trump’s assault on free speech is unprecedented in his lifetime. And while he noted there may be some rough comparisons to be made with the McCarthy era, it almost certainly has no parallel in the last 100 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But Jaffer, who now serves as executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, admitted that he didn’t predict such a contentious climate a year ago. In fact, he said, it wasn’t until about the 100th day of Trump’s second term that it set in how different the political landscape had become.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The 100th day, what?)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Other nonprofit groups from across the political spectrum had started to recognize the same patterns, and none of them were comfortable with the direction in which things were going. Collectively, in a letter addressed to the “leaders of American institutions,” Knight and six other free speech advocacy organizations called on the country to “stand more resolutely” against Trump’s “multi-front assault on First Amendment freedoms.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Despite the letter, Trump’s attack on First Amendment rights only escalated, as he made further funding freezes, presented more sweeping demands to institutions and proposed an unprecedented compact for higher ed that officials say would give preferential financial treatment to institutions that acquiesced to the president’s agenda.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It’s definitely a lower point for First Amendment rights, at least in terms of people’s belief that they can exercise those rights without consequence,” said Esha Bhandari, director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. “We still have those rights. That’s the important thing … [But] while some groups may be willing to go to court to vindicate their rights, litigation has a cost. And many people might think it’s simply easier to conform their speech to what the administration wants.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Jaffer said the last 10 months have shown the limits of litigation. The justice system is only effective if judges feel comfortable ruling against Congress or the White House, and under the Trump administration and its “campaign of intimidation,” that may not always be the case, he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The truth is, like, the Knight Institute is doing just fine. It’s our democracy that I’m more worried about,” Jaffer admitted. “At this point, ordinary Americans are going to have to defend their First Amendment freedoms, and they’re going to have to defend those freedoms by asserting them in court, by exercising them through public protest and by conveying to the political leaders that these freedoms are important to them.”</p>

<li>Two Champions of Academic Freedom Go to War — The AAUP and FIRE are at it. Again.</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When The Chronicle’s Emma Pettit posted a thread on X describing the “burst of debate” around the topic of viewpoint diversity, there was no reason to expect a social-media blowup. Her tweets were dry and informative, a roundup of relevant opinion coverage, in our pages and elsewhere, arguing for and against the notion that many academic disciplines would benefit from an infusion of non-left-wing faculty members.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But then the X account of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) responded: “Fascism generally doesn’t do great under peer review.” The post went on to speculate that the low number of conservatives in the academy could be a result of the fact that “the intellectual values of academia, which emphasizes critical inquiry &amp; challenges traditional norms … may be inherently less appealing to those with a more conservative worldview.” (Who writes the AAUP’s X posts? I asked an AAUP spokesperson, who told me that a number of people have access to the account.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The second part of the statement paraphrases a longstanding hypothesis about the dearth of conservatives in academe, although one under increasing pressure today. But the controversy that followed surely had more to do with the sloganeering about fascism, a streamlined restatement of something the AAUP’s president, Todd Wolfson, said in an interview with Pettit last month: “Fascist ideology does not do very well in a peer-reviewed process, right?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The incontinent petulance of social-media style notwithstanding, these flare-ups reflect some real differences between the two organizations. The first has to do with the principled defense of academic freedom. Not for the first time, the AAUP — or at least its X account — has accused FIRE of mainly supporting right-wing causes, defending the token liberal here or there to keep up appearances. Lukianoff, by the same token, implied that the AAUP avoids defending conservatives. Is there any merit in either charge?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>… certainly give the impression that something like an official AAUP position is emerging. That position has two planks. First, it refuses to grant any legitimacy to the notion that some disciplines might be afflicted by a disabling degree of political homogeneity; after all, those complaining about being kept out are “fascists,” who by definition have no place. Second, it insists that if conservative ideas are underrepresented, that is only the result of good epistemic hygiene, as enforced by peer review. Ideas are not rejected for being conservative, but for being wrong.</p>

King announced last week, according to Spectrum News 1. That’s out of about $700 million in federal grant funding that the system receives annually. Some of those cuts were due to the administration eliminating grants for projects that it considers to be related to diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>

<p>The prolonged government shutdown is helping the Trump administration advance its goal of closing the Department of Education — a longtime conservative aim that congressional Republicans have failed to act on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The agency had already reduced its staff by half earlier this year. Now, blaming the shutdown, the Education Department is trying to lay off another 465 people, cutting deeply into multiple offices. That includes federal officials who oversee special education programs and another round of slashing at the Office for Civil Rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“There’s something opportunistic about what we’re watching right now,” said Jim Blew, who served in a senior position at the Education Department during the first Trump administration. “These guys have very clear goals. When you give them an opportunity to achieve them, they go full bore.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If allowed to go into effect, the layoffs would decimate the Office for Civil Rights, which was already cut in half earlier this year, and gut offices that oversee every major K-12 program. That includes the $15 billion Individuals with Disabilities Education Act program for students with disabilities and the $18 billion Title I program, which aids high-poverty schools. Smaller programs such as one that supports charter schools were also hit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The people who work on grants to tribal colleges and historically Black colleges and universities were also let go, just weeks after the administration rerouted $495 million in grant funding to those schools. TRIO, a $1 billion suite of grants to support veterans and college students from low-income families, was gutted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The fact that Trump is gleefully using the shutdown as a pretext to hurt students is appalling,” said Sen.&nbsp;Patty Murray (Washington), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. “No one is forcing Donald Trump to fire the people who make sure students with disabilities can get a good education — he just wants to.”</p>

<p>The Trump administration is closing in on a deal with the University of Virginia, four months after government pressure forced the school’s previous president to resign.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A settlement would be the first time a public university has cut a far-reaching deal with the Trump administration as part of the White House’s extraordinary pressure campaign to shift the ideological tilt of the higher education system.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Among the terms reached in the past week, the University of Virginia would not pay a financial penalty nor submit to a direct monitoring arrangement, according to three people briefed on the negotiations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The university would be required to continue to take steps to come into compliance with the administration’s expansive interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision that ended explicit consideration of race in admissions to higher education, according to three people briefed on negotiations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Higher education leaders have increasingly viewed the administration’s insistence on an outside monitor, like Columbia agreed to include in its deal in July, as a potential infringement on academic freedom. Instead of including a monitor, who would report to the government on the university’s compliance, the University of Virginia would instead agree to provide regular updates to the government on how the university was addressing the administration’s civil rights concerns, two of the people said.</p>

<li>NYTimes: University of Virginia Makes Deal With White House to Halt Investigations</li>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/politics/university-of-virginia-trump-agreement.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/us/politics/university-of-virginia-trump-agreement.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The deal, which avoids the hefty fines agreed to by some private, Ivy League colleges, was viewed as something of a victory among leaders of the Charlottesville, Va.-based campus. It was signed one week after Paul Mahoney, the school’s interim president, rejected a White House offer of preferential treatment for research funding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Virginia will adhere to the administration’s interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision that ended explicit consideration of race in admissions to higher education as long as that guidance is “consistent with relevant judicial decisions.” Attorney General Pam Bondi laid out in a memo in July how that ruling, along with federal civil rights law, should be applied to schools receiving federal funding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Legal experts and higher education officials have argued that schools can still consider race as part of a holistic review of a student’s application. But the Trump administration has adopted a broader view, suggesting that race cannot be considered at all, to justify its attacks on policies and programs that promote racial diversity.</p>

<p>(The Washington Post editorial board has shifted its politics 180 degrees)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Universities understandably want to stop fighting with Trump, who has proven willing to choke off federal funds. Proponents of aggressive affirmative action will no doubt be dismayed by the deal, which leaves the university precious little room to balance its classes or its faculty by race. But they should take heart that the deal seems confined mostly to areas the government has traditionally overseen, rather than more sweeping intrusions on academic freedom and First Amendment rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The original compact proposed meddling in curricular decisions that are at the core of the university’s truth-seeking mission, such as getting rid of programs that “purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.” Agreeing to that would have undermined the university’s mission in a way that accepting scrutiny of admissions, DEI programs and the use of race in hiring does not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Whatever your opinion of its reading of civil rights law, the Trump administration is right that campuses need more viewpoint diversity and tolerance for those challenging orthodoxies. Monocultures tend to be insular and prone to groupthink, and academics are not exempt from this tendency. Disciplines that touch on politics are worse off if more than half the political spectrum is missing from discussions. Nor will such skewed classrooms be welcoming places for conservative students, who have as much right to an education as anyone else.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As part of a new deal with the Trump administration, the University of Virginia won’t have to pay money. It won’t have to write apology letters or adopt any specific policies. Several federal investigations into its diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts have been halted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The university will have to report back regularly to the Justice Department on compliance with civil-rights law. Even there, the details are scant — a contrast with previous agreements between Trump and colleges.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Justice Department is suspending its probe into UVa so long as the university complies with civil-rights law and follows, where applicable, the department’s July guidance on “unlawful discrimination.” The guidance states that the 2023 Supreme Court decision ending race-conscious admissions effectively bans a wide variety of DEI practices — including identity-based facilities, certain affinity groups, and criteria used as a proxy for race.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Cryptocurrency has found its hero in Mr.&nbsp;Trump. And in this unlikely moment of triumph, its most powerful proponent has laid bare the paradox at the heart of this brave new world of “new money.” Crypto was supposed to free us from the chains of government control, but now it is finally revealing what that freedom really means: removing all checks on the power of the wealthy to do what they want, discharged at last from law, supervision and civic obligation — even if the result is autocracy. Mr.&nbsp;Trump, with his thirst for money and power, has in one fell swoop both exposed and embraced the corruption at the heart of digital currencies — a corruption inherited from the libertarian ideals that created them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Trump seems to have understood something that escaped generations of libertarian politicians and philosophers: Rather than dissolving the power of the state totally, he could do so selectively, to put himself and his allies above the law, while using the full force of the state to punish his adversaries; to promote crypto, while also insisting he be in charge of the Fed; to pardon allies, while having his enemies charged.</p>
