<h1>Sep 5</h1>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.</p>
<p>Quote of the week: “difficult to conclude anything other than that defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities.”</p>
<p>Thanks to EI, ET, BE, JC, VAC for sharing things this week!</p>

<p>CADHE is a coalition of CUNY faculty and staff formed from a broader campaign to create a Mutual Academic Defense Compact (MADC) between CUNY, SUNY, and other universities. Membership is open to all CUNY faculty and staff who support its mission.</p>

<li>It’s Not a ‘Mutual-Defense Compact.’ But a New Ad From 18 Universities Aims to Send a Message.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/its-not-a-mutual-defense-compact-but-a-new-ad-from-18-universities-aims-to-send-a-message">https://www.chronicle.com/article/its-not-a-mutual-defense-compact-but-a-new-ad-from-18-universities-aims-to-send-a-message</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now the 18 universities in the Big Ten, which represent both an athletic conference and an academic alliance, have collaborated on an advertisement defending higher ed that will air during college football games. The 30-second spot blends a healthy dose of agrarian charm and shots of high-tech laboratories, highlighting the universities’ contributions to research, health care, and their communities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the same week that the new ad was announced, the chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign acknowledged that reality in an interview with Illinois Public Media. “I am assuming that we will eventually find ourselves a target, as is everyone in higher ed,” said Charles L. Isbell Jr.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Though the joint ad has been in the works for a while, Martin said he — along with representatives from Ohio State University, Illinois, and the Association of American Universities — formally pitched the idea during a May meeting of the Big Ten’s presidents and chancellors. Martin and several colleagues worked on the ad through the Big Ten Academic Alliance, a collaboration unit that’s funded by each member university’s provost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The chancellors and presidents were so supportive that they asked for two more spots,” Martin said.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Universities retreat under pressure, law firms submit to extortion, scientific and medical research funding has been decimated, federal employees face ideological purges, tariffs are imposed as political weapons, the military has become a domestic police force and the administration is demanding that cultural institutions mute or even eliminate criticism of the worst aspects of America’s past.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It is an asymmetric struggle without precedent in American political history, creating a predicament for all those opposed to a president who acts without regard to law, constitutional limits or congressional authorization, who disdains due process, prosecutes political adversaries and weaponizes regulatory agencies to attack the media, academia, the legal profession and liberal democracy itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While Trump thrives on the wreckage he leaves in his wake, he is guided by Russell Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, and Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser. Vought and Miller are coldblooded, ideologically driven strategists who have spent nearly a decade developing the foundations for this MAGA takeover of what was once a familiar American way of life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I wrote to Bob Bauer, a professor of practice at N.Y.U. law school and a Democratic expert in the structuring and financing of political organizations, asking for his views on the strategic options available to opponents of the MAGA agenda.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>He replied by email, arguing that “there is an urgent opposition to be mounted and effectively articulated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Mittelstadt [historian of 20th-century America at Rutgers] said she spoke at the Aug.&nbsp;14-15 conference on Liberalism for the 21st Century sponsored by the Institute for the Study of Modern Authoritarianism, where many participants supported a strategy of “Never Trumpers, liberals, libertarians all agreeing on a lowest common denominator of a rules-based order of some kind and fighting on that basis. While most on the center or left would, of course, endorse a rules-based order, I’m not certain it will capture the imagination of people who can’t pay for college or find a place to live affordably.”</p>

<li>The Battle for “Viewpoint Diversity”</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/curriculum/2025/09/02/battle-viewpoint-diversity">https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/curriculum/2025/09/02/battle-viewpoint-diversity</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now the White House is fueling their push, demanding viewpoint diversity under threat of huge funding cuts. Some say universities need to reform themselves to regain public and governmental support.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To take one example of conservatives forcing change, Indiana Republicans last year passed Senate Enrolled Act 202, which threatens the jobs of even tenured faculty at public universities who don’t foster intellectual diversity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Trump administration has also wielded intellectual diversity as a weapon in its demands of some of the nation’s wealthiest universities. In a letter to Harvard in April, government officials said that in order to get its federal research funding restored, the university must, among other things, employ a federally approved external party to “audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint diversity.” It didn’t define the term.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>State legislators tasked West Virginia University’s new Washington Center for Civics, Culture and Statesmanship with expanding “intellectual diversity,” offering “programming related to the values of open inquiry and civil discourse” and enriching the curriculum with the “great debates of western civilization.” Iowa’s Legislature created a “center for intellectual freedom” at the University of Iowa, ordering it to offer “civil discourse” programming and expand “intellectual diversity.” Similarly, Utah’s Legislature created a civic center at Utah State University committed to “viewpoint diversity and civil discourse” and mandated that all general ed courses be taught by faculty appointed to that center by its director.</p>

<p>Illinois passed a law in 2003 that grants in-state tuition to undocumented students who meet certain criteria. To qualify, students need to reside and attend high school in the state for three years, graduate from an Illinois high school, and sign an affidavit promising to apply to become a permanent resident as soon as possible. Pritzker then signed a bill into law last year that would loosen these criteria, starting in July 2026. Students will be able to pay in-state tuition rates if they meet one of two sets of requirements, including attending an Illinois high school for at least two years or a combination of high school and community college in the state for at least three years.</p>

<p>In July 2024, the UNC system and the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, convened representatives from Florida, Georgia, Iowa, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia to talk about alternatives to the current model for accreditation, documents show. The UNC system then recommended in a September 2024 report that North Carolina “establish an accreditation agency formed by state university systems.” The report laid out steps that are now the game plan for the new multistate accreditor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This spring, Dan Harrison, the UNC system’s vice president for academic affairs, sent a document to the system’s president describing himself and another UNC official, Andrew Kelly, as crucial to shaping how the accreditor would operate. “Currently, we enjoy some free ridership in that Florida is funding the effort, but the group relies on Kelly and Harrison for subject matter expertise,” the document stated. “There have not been major decision points where North Carolina’s preference has not been followed.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The tension between DeSantis’s public posturing and North Carolina officials’ influential role behind the scenes underscores a crucial question for many faculty members and other skeptics: whether the new organization will be a non-ideological auditor focused on public universities’ particular needs, as UNC system leaders have pledged, or become a tool for conservatives to remake higher education.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Under the 1965 Higher Education Act, accreditors must evaluate 10 broadly defined areas in assessing an institution’s quality, such as student achievement, curriculum, faculty, finances, and compliance with federal laws. In the United States, most colleges belong to independent accreditors that used to oversee particular regions. While it is technically a voluntary process, federal financial aid is so crucial to most colleges that accreditation is in practice a requirement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Over the years, however, conservative lawmakers and think tanks have increasingly accused accreditors of stepping on institutions’ and states’ toes over governance issues. Critics also argue the bodies force colleges to adopt progressive ideologies. While some large accreditors have diversity, equity, and inclusion standards, the main accreditor for colleges in the South — the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, known as SACS — does not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>… Kevin Kinser, an education-policy professor at Pennsylvania State University who studies accreditation, said the draft leaves many questions about how the standards will be evaluated. For example, if “viewpoint diversity” is a standard, he questioned how institutions would prove that they have faculty across the ideological spectrum.</p>
