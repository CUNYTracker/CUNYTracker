<h1>Oct 3</h1>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.</p>
<p>Thanks KB and BE for sharing links this week.</p>
<p>Quote of the week (on Berkeley and turning over names):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“But perhaps,” Professor Butler remembered replying, “it’s your job to defend the highest ideals of the university.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, maybe this too (on the “compact”):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This is extortion, plain and simple. … It is not hyperbole to say that the future of higher education in America requires that every university reject it. If any schools capitulate, the pressure will be enormous on all to fold. The only solution is solidarity and collective action against this effort at federal control over higher education.</p>

<li>NYTimes: Texas Tech Moves to Limit Academic Discussion to 2 Genders</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/26/us/politics/texas-tech-gender.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/26/us/politics/texas-tech-gender.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Texas Tech University system, one of the largest in the state, took steps to restrict academic discussions of gender, directing faculty in a letter circulated on Friday that they “must comply” with an executive order from President Trump recognizing only male and female genders.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The move, apparently a first among large institutions of higher education, raised alarm among professors and advocates of academic freedom across Texas. It signaled that an effort to restrict teaching about transgender people and other gender topics in K-12 classrooms — explicitly prohibited by Texas law — was expanding to colleges and universities, where no such ban exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The <a href="https://www.texastech.edu/downloads/9-25-25-memo-to-university-presidents-regarding-compliance.pdf">letter</a> ricocheted across the state’s universities, far beyond Texas Tech’s hub in Lubbock. It followed the rapid firing this month of a professor at Texas A&amp;M over her handling of a debate with a conservative student in her classroom, who objected to a discussion of gender identity and then shared a video of the encounter with a Republican lawmaker. The university’s president, Mark Welsh, resigned soon after.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I’m emotionally shellshocked right now,” said one professor in the Texas Tech system. “What does it say about academic freedom? It says we don’t have it.” … The professor spoke by phone from the inside of a car to avoid being overheard by colleagues.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Officials at several public universities in Texas have instructed faculty to review their syllabi and course content and remove anything that does not comply with current federal and state laws and executive orders. What type of content is noncompliant? It depends on whom you ask.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The college does not intend to create a formal policy prohibiting faculty members from teaching about transgender identity, she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By Friday, one directive was clear: Employees of the Texas Tech system may not teach about, discuss or acknowledge transgender identity. Tedd Mitchell, chancellor of the Texas Tech system, wrote in an email to the five universities’ leaders that they must comply with federal and state laws that “recognize only two human sexes: male and female.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“They’re pointing to an executive order from Trump and this letter from the governor, but … those are not intended to create a speech code for public universities. If they apply to a public university in this fashion, it wouldn’t just be Texas Tech doing it,” said Adam Steinbaugh, a senior attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression who is communicating with Texas faculty about the new directives. “So this is really just a voluntary effort to go out and censor, and it’s not supported by the executive order, and it’s certainly contradictory to the First Amendment.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The University of Texas System announced Tuesday it will audit courses related to gender studies to ensure compliance with state law at all its academic institutions, including UT Austin.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This move comes as many Texas higher education institutions have moved to comply with recently passed legislative bills, such as Senate Bill 37. The bill, which went into effect Sept.&nbsp;1, allows public institutions to review curriculum and degree programs, and it prompted the UT System to abolish faculty councils and senates in August.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Eric Cheyfitz, a professor of American studies at Cornell, said the university has canceled the two classes he was set to teach this semester. It comes as the provost is recommending that he be suspended for two semesters without pay on the grounds that he violated federal antidiscrimination laws, The Nation has learned.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“We believe that a student came to the course for the sole reason of surveilling and potentially harming students in the class,” Droubi said. “That ended up proving itself to be true because multiple students came forward and shared their concerns with Professor Cheyfitz.” Cheyfitz said one Palestinian student quit the class after telling him she felt upset and frightened.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>According to Cheyfitz, the graduate student often steered conversations away from the assigned readings—which at that point mostly focused on definitions of genocide and international law on Indigenous rights—to defend Israel’s conduct in the war in Gaza and argue with others in the class. “He clearly had not done the readings,” Cheyfitz said. “It was disruptive.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(As described, this student stepped on the Professor’s academic freedom in the classroom and worked to create a hostile learning environment. But wait there’s more…)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The student recorded the conversation the two had and later used the audio as evidence in a discrimination complaint against Cheyfitz. Cheyfitz said he hadn’t been told he was being recorded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Cornell’s Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX—which has since been relaunched as the Cornell Office of Civil Rights—reviewed the case in April. Cheyfitz claims that the office didn’t recommend discipline but did find him “responsible” for the discrimination charge. Katie King, associate vice president of the Cornell Office of Civil Rights, didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Governor Hochul has required all colleges have a Title VI coordinator)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>According to Cheyfitz, the office referred the matter to the dean of Cornell’s College of Arts and Sciences, Peter John Loewen, who recommended to the provost that Cheyfitz be suspended for two semesters without pay. Loewen declined to comment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Cheyfitz appealed the case to the Faculty Senate’s Committee on Academic Freedom and Professional Status of the Faculty. In June, the six-person panel, which is tasked with investigating matters of academic freedom, found unanimously that there was insufficient evidence to back up Renard’s [a PhD candidate in computer science whose identity was confirmed by other students in the class, previously served in Israel’s elite military surveillance agency, Unit 8200] discrimination claim, according to a committee report obtained by The Nation. … the Faculty Senate panel wrote in its report that sanctions that had been recommended by Loewen were “no longer warranted.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Cheyfitz and Droubi argued that should have been the end of the disciplinary process. According to Cornell policy, the dean “must accept the Committee’s findings of fact and conclusions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In Cheyfitz and Droubi’s view, the case cuts to the heart of academic freedom, particularly at a time when the Trump administration has stripped funding from some elite colleges over allegations they let antisemitism, anti-Israel prejudice, and liberal bias go unchecked on campus. The New York Times has reported that talks between Cornell and the White House to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding have stalled in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Whittington is incorrect. Professors need to generally teach their classes in ways that are germane to the subject and competent (the <a href="https://www.aaup.org/reports-publications/aaup-policies-reports/policy-statements/1940-statement-principles-academic#6">standard</a> is “avoid persistently intruding material which has no relation to their subject”). But it does not follow that professors must always “limit themselves to speech that is both germane and competent.” This view that uttering one word deemed off-topic or incorrect in the classroom would subject a professor to punishment and they would have “little defense” is a standard far too restrictive under any meaningful sense of academic freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Academic freedom is an important right because it contributes to intellectual honesty, and truth, not imagined reductions in political polarization, is the goal. We protect academic freedom for everyone in academia as a fundamental right even when an individual professor says something terrible or stupid. We don’t revoke the First Amendment because one idiot says something awful, and the same approach should apply to the right of academic freedom. What justifies academic freedom is not the brilliance and inoffensiveness of all professors, but the importance of free expression to academic work and a free society.</p>

<p>U.S. officials used the immigration system in unprecedented ways to covertly research and detain noncitizen students, relying on an investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security whose work traditionally has focused on crimes such as drug smuggling and human trafficking.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge William Young in Boston ruled that the push to target Ozturk and other students was blatantly unconstitutional. The White House vowed to appeal the decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Among the findings: White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, a top ally of President Donald Trump and architect of his mass deportation campaign, spoke with senior officials at the State Department and DHS more than a dozen times in March to discuss student visa revocations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Homeland Security Investigations, an arm of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that investigates transnational crime, took the lead. HSI researched the protesters and referred dozens of cases to the State Department, sometimes citing an obscure statute<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> for revoking visas. Then it carried out the arrests.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>HSI analysts compiled more than 100 reports on protesters, a first, according to the official who oversaw the process. In at least two cases, including Ozturk’s, the HSI supervisory agents involved in the arrests sought additional legal guidance because they had never detained students whose immigration status had changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While the Trump administration publicly accused Ozturk of engaging in activities “in support of Hamas,” an internal State Department memo noted that there was no evidence that Ozturk had engaged in any antisemitic activity or indicated any support for terrorism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For this unusual assignment [a so-called “tiger team” devoted to the effort], one source above all was key: The team relied heavily on the website of Canary Mission, an opaque, anonymous pro-Israel group that says it documents individuals who “promote hatred of the USA, Israel and Jews,” focusing primarily on college campuses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The HSI tiger team ultimately generated between 100 to 200 reports on protesters, Hatch said, with many of the names coming from Canary Mission. Some came from Betar US, a militant Zionist organization that the Anti-Defamation League considers an extremist group. Several names also came directly from DHS leadership, Hatch said, as well as the office of White House border czar Tom Homan.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The White House showed keen interest in the process. John Armstrong, the senior consular official at the State Department, testified that he spoke with Miller more than a dozen times on conference calls that discussed student visa revocations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Cunningham said that in his 17 years at HSI, he couldn’t recall another time when he had received a “top-down” instruction to surveil and arrest someone solely due to a visa revocation. So he reached out separately to an HSI lawyer “to ensure that we were on solid legal ground.”</p>

<p>The Trump administration’s offer to give preferential treatment to colleges and universities in exchange for allegiance to a partisan ideological agenda stinks of favoritism, patronage, and bribery. It is entirely corrupt. White House Policy Strategist May Mailman reportedly hopes that “a lot of schools see that” government control of their institution is “highly reasonable.” In reality, adherence to Mailman’s loyalty oath would usher in a new era of thought policing in American higher education. Mailman’s compacts would steer tax payer money in ways that violate core principles of US higher education and democracy and cripple innovation. They would reward campuses that toe the party line and punish those that cherish their independence. In doing so, it would commit the very viewpoint discrimination it claims to redress.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It is not hyperbole to say that the future of higher education in America requires that every university reject it. If any schools capitulate, the pressure will be enormous on all to fold.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>President Trump is trying to circumvent the legislative and judicial branches of our government by presenting this as a deal with schools. Nothing in the Constitution or federal law authorizes the president to do this unilaterally. The Supreme Court has been clear that Congress can set conditions on federal funds so long as the requirements are constitutional, clearly stated, related to the purpose of the program and not unduly coercive. Mr.&nbsp;Trump’s compact fails every part of that test.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Moreover, there is a basic principle of constitutional law — the unconstitutional conditions doctrine — that the government cannot condition a benefit on a recipient having to give up a constitutional right.

<li>NIH is spending its grant money, but leaving thousands of projects unfunded - The Washington Post</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/09/26/nih-funding-research-grants/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/09/26/nih-funding-research-grants/</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A senior leader at the National Institutes of Health wrote an impassioned email to staff on the last Friday in August, lauding them for pulling off a “near-miracle.” The round-the clock work of officials inside NIH, according to the letter, helped put the agency on track to get all of its grant money out to labs across the country, the majority of its nearly $48 billion budget.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The scramble ensured the money flowed to labs and science, instead of returning the unspent funds to government coffers. NIH shifted its budgeting strategy in June toward awarding more grants their entire multiyear budget up front. But the budgeting technique comes at a cost. Hundreds of grants deemed excellent by peer review are being left on the table, leaving strong research on cancer, aging and diabetes unfunded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>NIH has awarded nearly 3,000 fewer research project grants than it did the previous year, according to an analysis by Michael Lauer, the former deputy director of extramural research at NIH, using publicly available data downloaded two weeks before the end of the fiscal year.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“We were on our way to making over 700 awards this year, but … we had to drastically change that prediction,” said Douglas Lowy, principal deputy director of the National Cancer Institute at a meeting in September. “It looks like we’ll end up funding more on the order of 400 awards.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>ince the mid-1940s, the National Institutes of Health has sent billions of dollars to university researchers whose work has led to the creation of scores of lifesaving treatments for a range of diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer’s and heart disease. By one estimate, NIH-funded research was linked to roughly 99 percent of drugs that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved between 2010 and 2019.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A new peer-reviewed paper published in Science last week found that more than half of the drugs approved in the 21st century are linked to research that would have been at risk of never getting funded if the NIH had been operating with a 40 percent smaller budget.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aeb1564">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aeb1564</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We identified at-risk grants using the actual scores received by NIH grants, which were provided to one of the authors for the 1980 to 2007 period. At NIH, grant applications are funded according to two key factors: the priority score and the institute responsible for potentially funding it. Broadly speaking, each NIH institute funds the applications it is assigned in order of priority scores until its budget is exhausted (5). Because we have information on a grant’s score and its assigned institute, we could closely recreate this rank ordering and identify which applications would not have been funded, had the budget been 40% smaller.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Next, we linked these at-risk grants to FDA-approved drugs. … The Bayh-Dole Act requires patent-holders who received government funding to add a “government-interest statement” to their patents and report their patents back to the funding agency.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Of the 557 drugs that were approved between 2000 and 2023, we found that 40 (or 7.1%) drugs have at least one patent that directly acknowledges NIH extramural funding. Of this set, 14 acknowledge funding from an at-risk grant (see the first table). These include Cerdelga (generic name Eliglustat, approved by the FDA in 2014),</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Of the 557 drug approvals in our sample, 331 (59.4%) have a patent that cites at least one research publication acknowledging NIH support. Indeed, more than half of approved drugs (286, or 51.4%) are linked to at-risk research—research funded by grants that would have been cut under a 40% budget reduction. A flagship example is Gleevec…</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In recent months, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Jayanta Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, have taken aim at the scientific publishing industry, changing policies and using their platforms to lodge their own criticisms. They’ve pledged to address concerns about bias, misinformation and access. In August, Bhattacharya wrote in a memo that part of his strategy to rebuild public trust in science will include focusing on “replicable, reproducible, and generalizable research” as “the basis for truth in biomedical science.” The “publish or perish” culture, he added, “favors the promotion of only favorable results, and replication work is little valued or rewarded.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While numerous experts Inside Higher Ed interviewed said some of the government’s grievances about scientific publishing are real, they’re skeptical that the solutions the HHS and NIH have proposed so far will yield meaningful reforms. And one warned that the Trump administration—which continues to promote misinformation about vaccines, among other things—is exploiting that reality to further its own ideological agenda.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the Trump administration’s quest to reshape academic publishing could end up giving the government more control over journals that have long acted as the gatekeepers of validated scientific research.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In April, then-interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Edward R. Martin Jr.&nbsp;sent letters to numerous journals, including The Journal of the American Medical Association and CHEST (a journal published by the American College of Chest Physicians), questioning them about what he called political bias.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And before taking his post, Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorff, a former Harvard University biostatistician, launched their own journal—The Journal of the Academy of Public Health, which is linked to the right-wing news site RealClearPolitics—as a counter to mainstream journals.</p>

<p>Science reported that the directors felt they were targeted as part of the administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion and for political reasons. Jeanne Marrazzo, the former NIAID director, took over for Anthony Fauci, a frequent target for Republicans who took issue with his approach to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<p>Harvard and the government spent much of the summer in talks before the negotiations stalled.

<li>NYTimes: Harvard Blasts Administration Over ‘Distorted’ Civil Rights Investigation</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Trump administration’s move this week to choke off Harvard University’s access to future federal funding came after a scathing letter from the college accusing the administration of distorting evidence to show that the school violated civil rights laws by allowing antisemitism to persist on campus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In a strongly worded, 163-page letter with attachments on Sept.&nbsp;19, which has not been previously reported, Harvard assailed the government’s findings. The university accused investigators at the Health and Human Services Department of relying on “inaccurate and incomplete facts,” failing to meet a single legal requirement to prove discrimination and drawing sweeping conclusions from a survey of one-half of 1 percent of the student body.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harvard painted a picture of a chaotic Trump administration rushing to leverage federal power against the university. For instance, it noted that the health department had chided the college for failing to produce certain records. But Harvard’s documents showed that the records in question had been provided in response to a request from the Education Department. Harvard said the health department never asked for those records.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harvard said the health department’s decision to refer its findings to the Justice Department was “based on a fabricated and distorted interpretation of the record.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The only specific incident in the health department’s report that would show antisemitism disrupted a student’s access to education, Harvard lawyers wrote, was not a firsthand account.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It is an anonymous account from one student,” according to Harvard’s letter. This student had said that “other students stopped going to a class because those other students did not feel safe.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Another example of antisemitism cited by the health department was of a Jewish student who reported that her mezuza had gone missing. But Harvard noted that the decorative symbol of Jewish faith had been found by the university police in the hallway, three doors down from the student’s room. That suggested the mezuza “may have fallen because the adhesive tape used to affix it to the doorway had given way, and not because it was deliberately vandalized.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced on Monday that it referred Harvard University for suspension and debarment proceedings, the latest creative research-funding threat the government has employed to pressure the university into policy changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The referral begins a process that could result in Harvard being barred from receiving grants for some time. The Chronicle wrote to several former directors of the HHS’s civil-rights office, which announced the move, seeking expert guidance on understanding it. Only Roger Severino, who served during the first Trump administration, responded on the record. “Debarment puts grant recipients on a blacklist that prohibits them from having any more contracts with the federal government,” he wrote in an emailed statement. “It is reserved for bad actors that refuse to comply with the law and Harvard has proven entirely unwilling to come into compliance with civil-rights law.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(“bad actors”…)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Monday’s announcement said both a suspension and debarment would have “government-wide effect,” suggesting they would block Harvard’s eligibility for all government grants, not just those issued by HHS, which includes the National Institutes of Health.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Research from the University of Southern California Center for Generative AI and Society found that the average student who uses generative AI services does so to get a direct answer, not to learn.

<p>The speed with which AI is developing and spreading further complicates efforts to measure its impact.

A year later, said Lindsay K. Wayt, senior director for business intelligence at the organization, “my gut would tell me that number is higher.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The despair didn’t last long. In August 2024, I became one of three named plaintiffs leading a class-action lawsuit against the A.I. company Anthropic for pirating my books and hundreds of thousands of other books to train its A.I. The fight felt daunting, almost preposterous: me — a queer, female thriller writer — versus a company now worth $183 billion?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Thanks to the relentless work of everyone on my legal team, the unthinkable happened: Anthropic agreed to pay authors and publishers $1.5 billion in the largest copyright settlement in history. A federal judge preliminarily approved the agreement last week.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The settlement isn’t perfect. It’s absurd that it took an army of lawyers to demonstrate what any 10-year-old knows is true: Thou shalt not steal. At around $3,000 per work, shared by the author and publisher, the damages are far from life-changing (and, some argue, a slap on the wrist for a company flush with cash). I also disagree with the judge’s ruling that, had Anthropic acquired the books legally, training its chatbot on them would have been “fair use.” I write my novels to engage human minds — not to empower an algorithm to mimic my voice and spit out commodity knockoffs to compete directly against my originals in the marketplace, nor to make that algorithm’s creators unfathomably wealthy and powerful.</p>
