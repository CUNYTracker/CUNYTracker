<p>(Thanks K for sharing this lengthy and interesting article about the background for the postponed testimony of the UC Chancellor, the CUNY Chancellor, and campus leader of Georgetown in front of a House subcommittee)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Ever since President Trump announced in January a crackdown on antisemitism in higher education that included threats to deport pro-Palestinian student protesters, his administration has used that framework to rescind billions of dollars in research money from U.S. universities he claims are not protecting their Jewish students. Trump has demanded that at some universities, the federal government should be allowed to influence student admissions, faculty hiring, and the content of some academic departments. The federal government has already canceled $2.6 billion in research grants to Harvard, $400 million to Columbia University, and millions more to five other universities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In a talk at the Berkeley City Club last Wednesday, Lyons addressed the assault on higher education, its impacts on Cal, the balance between free speech and the right for all students to feel safe on campus, and how the UC system is approaching this era, all while it is wondering and waiting if UC will get one of those dreaded “Columbia-Harvard letters” from the administration announcing draconian cuts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>More cuts may be coming. Leo Terrell, senior counsel at the Department of Justice and head of its antisemitism task force, said in a Fox TV interview in May that there will be “massive lawsuits against [the] UC system. … Expect hate crime charges filed by the federal government. Expect Title VII lawsuits.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Has Berkeley turned a blind eye to antisemitism?” Lyons asked in a hypothetical question to the Berkeley City Club audience. “Have we been deliberately indifferent about antisemitism on campus? No way.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But executive orders aren’t law, said Catherine Lhamon, former assistant secretary for civil rights in the U.S. Department of Education, at a journalism conference in May. “Executive orders bind federal agencies about what the president directs those federal agencies to do. They don’t create law.” When asked about Trump’s antisemitism executive order, she added that schools and colleges “have an opportunity to challenge that in court, and they are not bound by the administration’s interpretation.” Llamon was recently named executive director of the Edley Center on Law &amp; Democracy at UC Berkeley Law.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>He [David Cole, a professor at Georgetown Law] told the committee that antisemitism only violates Title VI in narrow circumstances: When the speech is targeting an individual’s Jewish identity and when the speech is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies equal access to an education.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“That’s a very high standard,” Cole said in the hearing. “It’s almost never been met in the case law.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“To be honest, and with all due respect, the hearings this committee held on this same subject last year are reminiscent not of a fair trial of any sort, but of the kind of hearings the House Committee on Un-American Activities used to hold,” Cole said in his testimony. “And I think we can all agree that the HUAC hearings were both a big mistake and a major intrusion on the First Amendment rights of Americans.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The House committee wants to know if the widespread protests against Israel’s war in Gaza were authentic or were orchestrated by outside forces.</p>

<p>student organizer Hadeeqa Arzoo Malik has been suspended for a year. While she is suspended from CCNY, she is not permitted to enroll in any other CUNY college.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>CUNY has also fired four faculty members, including Corinna Mullin. Mullin held teaching positions at CUNY as an adjunct professor at Brooklyn College and John Jay College of Criminal Justice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the middle of June, Malik was notified of her suspension in a letter signed by CCNY’s Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs, Dr.&nbsp;Ramón De Los Santos. During Malik’s speech at the press conference, which was chanted via “the people’s mic,” a familiar call-and-response tactic used by protest organizers, Malik shared CUNY’s justification for suspending her.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I was suspended… for allegedly violating the CUNY Henderson Rules number one and seven and CCNY demonstration policies one and two.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Mullin told Mondoweiss, “Over the past several years, there has been a pattern of external Zionist, far-right organizations like Camera, Betar, and Canary Mission targeting me and other CUNY workers and students for organizing in solidarity with Palestine.”</p>

<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that the cause of higher education is in great measure the cause of all humanity, that higher education’s function is to secure human equality, expand human rights, and free human potential; and that colleges and universities were instituted, and derive their just powers, from their commitments to the following foundational principles:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the pursuit of knowledge, truth, and wisdom for the public good; the cultivation of freedoms of thought, inquiry, speech, expression, assembly, and association for all students, staff, and faculty; the integrity of academic research, teaching, and learning; the provision of educational programs and services to all students in the safest and most supportive environment possible; the advancement of diversity, equity, and inclusion; the autonomy and democratic accountability of campus governance.</p>

<p>This decision disserves Baylor students, faculty, and the broader Christian community. Baylor has a duty to protect and uphold the integrity of scientific inquiry, allowing its world class faculty to investigate complex issues without fear of reprisal based on shifting political winds. Pulling the rug out from under its faculty after those researchers have already put the grueling work into securing funding, work they undertook with Baylor’s full knowledge and approval, is a chilling affront to the very concept of academic freedom. Stymying research and opportunity will inevitably lead the best and brightest students and faculty to other universities where their work and their freedom will be valued and protected.</p>

<p>We believe a fundamental reason for the decline of the pursuit of truth on campuses is the collapse in acknowledging the importance of civic friendship — which, following Aristotle, we understand to be the bond of mutual respect and willingness to cooperate for the sake of the common good, even across significant disagreements or divisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The cultivation and recovery of civic friendship must necessarily undergird any successful effort by universities to regain public legitimacy and the moral high ground. Here, we hope to provide some guidance for restoring campus cultures where faculty and students feel free to speak their minds and explore ideas, no matter how unpopular or controversial on or off campus they happen to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This is because universities that do not model and actively foster civic friendship become ideological seminaries, sending into the world graduates who have been trained to be zealots for particular causes rather than formed as dispassionate and determined truth-seekers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>They call for the principled defense of freedom of speech and the consistent enforcement of rules against speech-chilling behaviors such as harassment and the shouting-down of speakers, as well as any activities that disrupt core academic priorities such as teaching, studying and research. And they demand a commitment by university leaders to ensuring that seminar rooms and lecture halls are not “safe spaces” but rather Socratic Spaces, where students are made to wrestle with ideas that challenge their preconceived assumptions and deeply held beliefs — indeed, ideas which might make them feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>But Mr.&nbsp;Trump’s push to end D.E.I. has been a blunt instrument, eliminating highly competitive grant programs that defined diversity well beyond race and gender. Those who have lost grants include not only Black and Latino scientists, but also many like Mr.&nbsp;Dillard, who are white and from rural areas, which are solidly Trump country. The administration has decried universities as hotbeds of liberal elitism, inhospitable to viewpoint diversity. The canceled diversity grant programs were intended to make science less elite, by developing a pipeline from poorer areas of the country that tend to be more conservative.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I think it’s very different in their minds, who is getting the D.E.I. stuff,” Mr.&nbsp;Dillard said. “People on the right, they don’t realize they’re limiting the opportunity of their own kids by supporting this.”</p>

<p>With that, Buan became one of thousands of early-career scholars who have become collateral damage amid policy changes at the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and other government agencies. As these agencies have sought to put caps on indirect funding, several doctoral programs paused or reduced admissions in February and March. Another wave of uncertainty hit weeks later, as the NIH and NSF terminated hundreds of existing grants, throwing many current doctoral and postdoctoral scholars’ funding into question. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year contains deep cuts to the NIH, NSF, and other federal agencies that support scientific research.</p>

<p>All told, the White House’s actions, many of which are tied up in court, could result in a lost generation of budding academics.

<p>The first hundred days of the second Trump administration was unprecedented, with the administration taking remarkably aggressive, often questionably legal actions across health policy. This article uses the Health Systems Performance Assessment Framework to identify key policies regarding resources, financing, governance, and service delivery and their impact on the cost, quality, access, and equity of the US health system. The evaluation is largely negative. The administration, in its very energetic first hundred days, has already undermined resources, financing, and in particular governance in areas as diverse as oversight of long-term care, scientific research, and vaccination policy. Administration rhetoric and budget proposals called for severe reductions in health care access and actions to terminate services for particular groups, such as immigrants or gender minorities. Many of the particular actions, such as mass layoffs of specialist scientific and regulatory staff, will be difficult to reverse.</p>

<p>Shocks to specialist research communities cause rapid attrition, with scientists exiting the workforce and even the country after as little as a month of disrupted funding, and resources diverted from high-quality basic research to privately assigned, less-impactful work.17,18 They may also increase hesitancy around research participation, particularly for groups that are already under-represented in health research. One estimate suggests that the administration’s proposed NIH cuts, over 25 years, will save $500bn and cost the country $8.2 trillion in lost health-a cost more than 16 times greater than the savings, even excluding lost economic benefits from health research.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Across Table 1, the second Trump administration’s record is one of unprecedented damage. Budget proposals that were not enacted but started in the first hundred days would exacerbate the damage through enormous cuts to Medicaid, supplemental nutrition, HHS and NIH. Decentralizing responsibilities to the states will produce less efficiency (due to loss of economies of scale and specialist resources such as laboratories), more variation in state politics, resources, and risks, and more inequality between states.108 Trump is the least popular president in US polling history.109 It remains to be seen whether the majority of Americans will stand up and successfully demand that he change course to reflect their views.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The National Institutes of Health announced a plan Tuesday to implement a cap on the fees publishers can charge NIH-funded researchers to make their work publicly accessible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Both the updated open-access policy and the NIH’s newly announced publisher fee cap, which takes effect next year, are designed to put some limits on the $19 billion for-profit scholarly publishing industry, which is dominated by a small group of for-profit megapublishers, including Elsevier, Taylor &amp; Francis and Springer Nature. The industry thrives on the unpaid work of scholars—including thousands funded by the NIH and other federal agencies—who rely on publishing their research in prestigious journals to earn tenure, promotion and recognition as leaders in their fields.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I expect the response to this will be that these journals will lose some of their market power,” Bhattacharya told Charlie Kirk, founder of the right-wing group Turning Point USA, in an interview Tuesday. “A lot of their market power has to do with the fact that they bully scientists into paying large fees and essentially end up bullying us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>During the pandemic, Bhattacharya, who was a health economist at Stanford University before Trump appointed him director of the NIH, became one of the political right’s favorite examples of how the so-called scientific elite allegedly suppressed nonconformist scientific beliefs. In 2020, he criticized public officials’ recommendations for people to stay home to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus, sparking widespread backlash from other experts—including the officials running the NIH at the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But now that he’s in charge of the same agency that dismissed his views as “fringe” nearly five years ago, Bhattacharya has vowed to “establish a culture of respect for free speech in science and scientific dissent at the NIH.”</p>

<p>The goal, Canary Mission says, is to “ensure that today’s radicals are not tomorrow’s employees” and “combat the rise in anti-Semitism on college campuses.” But lawyers, activists, and critics of the site worry that the consequences could now be more serious than diminished job prospects and that foreign students like Öztürk—who have been rounded up by the Trump administration—may have been targeted for imprisonment and deportation because they were listed on an anonymous blacklisting site.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But American foreign policy has turned sharply hawkish against China, and even though Harvard has steadily reduced its ties there, the Trump administration has made the relationship another line of attack in its broader effort to bring the university to heel. The administration has stripped away billions of dollars in federal research funding and is trying to revoke its right to host international students and also end its nonprofit tax status.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Alan M. Garber, the university’s president, has described the administration’s overall assault on the school as a power grab “unmoored from the law, to control teaching and learning at Harvard and to dictate how it operates.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To some observers, Harvard’s stand might seem like it’s just Ivy League self‑regard, an affluent institution protecting its perks. That reading gets the stakes backward. What is under attack is the rule‑of‑law scaffolding that lets any voluntary association—PTA or synagogue, start‑up or labor union—pursue its mission without waiting for White House permission slips or fearing punitive retaliation. A university that surrenders control over whom it may admit, hire, or teach ceases to be a university; it becomes a subordinate creature of politicians and the ever-changing whims of election results.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The counterexample is on display in another venerable American institution of higher education, the University of Virginia, where president James Ryan proffered his resignation in the face of a targeted pressure campaign from the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, and UVA’s Board of Visitors accepted it. Under the thin pretense of enforcing civil rights laws, the federal government is now essentially dictating policies, curriculum, and personnel according to the political whims of the White House.</p>

<p>Yet history warns that trimming our sails in hopes of preserving research dollars often achieves neither independence nor solvency. Ask Central European University.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The rest of us have a part to play. Other universities can file amicus briefs. Foundations and philanthropists can step in to help keep research going while funding cutoffs are litigated.

<p>Under the Republican law, New York will lose $7.5 billion used to cover legal immigrants in the Essential Plan, which is almost entirely paid for by the federal government. The state will then have to transfer many of those people to Medicaid, which will cost an additional $2.7 billion, since federal aid for Medicaid only covers about 56% of the actual costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Since the state’s fiscal year goes to the end of March, the cost in the current budget will be about $2.5 billion. But for the 2027 fiscal year, the cost will be slightly more than $10 billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>New York will also immediately need to build a system to verify twice a year that Medicaid and SNAP recipients remain eligible by meeting new work requirements. The Hochul Administration estimates the cost at $500 million a year.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The stakes are high. A survey Public Health Solutions conducted of New Yorkers with a household income of less than $60,000 found that 71% would be unable to keep insurance, and 64% said they would be unable to maintain their doctor visits.</p>

<li>NYTimes: Why 1.5 Million New Yorkers Could Lose Health Insurance Under Trump Bill</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/nyregion/trump-domestic-policy-bill-new-york-health-care.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare">https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/nyregion/trump-domestic-policy-bill-new-york-health-care.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In one key respect, the law’s impact will be felt more keenly in New York than in any other state — and it has nothing to do with Medicaid.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Instead, it is the result of an obscure federal funding mechanism that sends billions of dollars a year to New York and nothing to most states. That money, which started flowing as a result of the Affordable Care Act, will be reduced drastically under the new law, beginning next year.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Overall, the state could absorb a $10 billion hit annually because of the policy law. That reflects a combination of increased state expenditures and cuts in federal subsidies that support health insurance and health care for people with lower incomes.</p>
