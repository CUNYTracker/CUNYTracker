<h1>Jul 25</h1>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.</p>
<p>Thanks to EI, KW, and VAC for flagging contributions this week.</p>
<p>While the awful Columbia news is hard to miss there are few under the radar pieces here worth paying attention to: a manifesto from the Manhattan Institute and a piece from the Chronicle on how this institute and others have plotted to take down the president at George Mason detailing the game plan.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>At Tuesday’s hearing, Stefanik launched baseless attacks on other CUNY faculty members. She pushed for disciplining law professor Ramzi Kassem on the grounds that he represented Mahmoud Khalil, and Saly Abd Alla, the university’s chief diversity officer, over her past work as a civil rights director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Minnesota.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Does it concern you that New York taxpayers are paying for the legal defense fund of Mahmoud Khalil?” she asked Matos Rodríguez.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Matos Rodríguez said he was not familiar with those individual employees, but stressed that any employee who violates CUNY’s rules will be investigated. He said CUNY had no complaints related to Abd Alla and that she is not directly involved with handling cases related to students and faculty.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Pro-Palestinian protesters repeatedly interrupted the hearing. As Matos Rodríguez spoke, one person yelled, “Israel is burning children alive.” Later in the hearing, another protester also shouted to disrupt Matos Rodríguez’s remarks, prompting Rep.&nbsp;Randy Fine (R-Fla.) to say, “Shut up and get out of here… get out of here you loser.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Rep.&nbsp;Alma Adams (D-N.C.) relayed to the chancellor CUNY faculty members’ concerns about professors who were not reappointed despite having fully enrolled classes scheduled for the fall. “As a former professor myself and a department chair — somebody who believes deeply in transparency and fairness — I want to ask you: would you be willing to follow up with my office and provide more information on the policies and procedures that guide faculty appointments and reappointments at CUNY?” she asked. Matos Rodríguez said he was willing to cooperate fully with the committee.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“These hearings are political theater. That’s all they are,” said David Cole, a Georgetown Law professor who testified in his capacity as an expert on the First Amendment at an earlier hearing in May. “It almost doesn’t matter what the university presidents say… there is no effort to even determine what the truth is, what actually happened, or whether any legal lines have been crossed.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Professional Staff Congress—CUNY’s staff and faculty union—and many from the greater CUNY community are saying the hearing by House Republicans was really meant to silence CUNY’s advocates for Palestinian human rights. Matos-Rodriguez, they argue, failed to defend those community members, as well as the tenets of free speech and robust, open conversation that are critical components of a thriving academic institution. “It was an egregious abdication of his responsibility as an academic and his responsibility as a leader of an academic institution,” said Heba Gowayed, an associate professor of sociology at Hunter College.</p>

<li>Stefanik’s latest battle doesn’t fight antisemitism; it attacks due process</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Stefanik’s latest target has been a legal clinic at the City University of New York School of Law, called CUNY CLEAR, an acronym for Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Whatever the merits of Stefanik’s other accusations, she is absolutely wrong about CUNY CLEAR. Representation of a controversial client is in the best tradition of legal education.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Outraged that CUNY CLEAR had played a key role in Khalil’s representation, Stefanik called upon Rodriguez to fire the CUNY professor who coordinated the defense.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Rodriguez was non-committal, promising only to investigate the situation. That was the tactful response, but he missed a teachable moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Although that may never be acceptable to Stefanik, Rodriguez should have explained that representing unpopular clients is what lawyers are supposed to do, and what law students should be taught to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I [Steven Lubet, opinion contributor] agree with almost nothing Khalil stands for, but I believe strongly in due process and fair trials. There is no right to appointed counsel in immigration cases, so Khalil’s representation could only come from organizations such as the ACLU and CLEAR.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Dear President Anderson,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We are writing to express concern about the recent firing and non-renewals of four Brooklyn College adjunct faculty members, recently addressed in statements by the Professional Staff Congress-CUNY and CUNY University Faculty Senate leadership.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While the Brooklyn College administration and the CUNY Board of Trustees have the power of review and final decision, faculty have primacy in academic decision-making, including matters of faculty status. This principle is clearly established in the 1940 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities, jointly formulated by the American Association of University Professors, the American Council on Education (ACE), and the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges (AGB).</p>

<p>While the UFS does not represent any faculty in contract compliance manners, we do defend academic freedom vigorously.

All faculty members should have access to the same due-process protections and procedures.”</p>

<li>The Dangers of the Manhattan Statement</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/columns/debatable-ideas/2025/07/22/dangers-manhattan-statement">https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/columns/debatable-ideas/2025/07/22/dangers-manhattan-statement</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Something that caught my eye last week was news of a statement calling for even more government control over higher education from a group of conservatives. This comes as the right fully embraces Donald Trump’s authoritarian commands against universities. Developed by Christopher Rufo of the Manhattan Institute, the Manhattan Statement was carefully designed using public polling to create vague, popular-sounding principles (“truth” “freedom of speech” “equality” “civil discourse” “transparency”) that obscure its plan for massive federal control over colleges and repression of dissent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Manhattan Statement is a recipe for tyranny. Even if some people might agree with its goals, what’s important are not the ends but the repressive means used to achieve them. It calls for “a new contract with the universities, which should be written into every grant, payment, loan, eligibility, and accreditation, and punishable by revocation of all public benefit.” We’ve already seen how the Trump regime has terribly, illicitly abused its power over government contracts to punish colleges without due process. The Manhattan Statement would vastly expand this power to include all federal funding and student loans, making every college held hostage for its existence to any demands of the government.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Instead of pretending that “antisemitism” somehow justified cutting off federal funds in direct defiance of the due process required under Title VI, the Manhattan Statement would provide a wide array of reasons for political ideologues to destroy a college, with its amorphous calls to abolish “ideology” and “activism” and require “swift expulsion” of anyone deemed to violate “civil discourse.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In recent years, many conservatives have abandoned their past commitments to free speech and the rejection of federal control over academia. … It’s disturbing to see so many thoughtful conservatives that I respect joining a call for massive expansion of government control over colleges.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One of the signers, Representative Virginia Foxx (R-NC), is a member (and former chair) of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, a sign that the Manhattan Statement is not some theoretical wish list aimed at reforming universities, but a very real political threat that could easily be enforced on colleges in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>However, even terrible legislation is too slow a process for these conservatives, who write that “we call on the President of the United States to draft a new contract with the universities” with these extraordinary requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To legitimize government intrusion, the Manhattan Statement invents pure historical fiction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Well, I’d quote the whole thing, but I’ll stop here)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What the Manhattan Statement claims to be the problem—“a new kind of tyranny—one in which ideology determines truth, and the university functions as a political agent …”—is, in fact, the perfect description of Rufo’s solution. He’s simply taking a deluded fantasy of left-wing tyranny on campus as a justification to impose a very real proposal for right-wing tyranny.</p>

<li>NYTimes: I Watched It Happen in Hungary. Now It’s Happening Here.</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>After years watching Hungary suffocate under the weight of its democratic collapse, I came to understand that the real danger of a strongman isn’t his tactics; it’s how others, especially those with power, justify their acquiescence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hungarians with little power or privilege to lose would occasionally protest. But those with power remained reliably, pliably silent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The American officials and academics who, like me, lived in Hungary during this period would often tell ourselves stories to explain this submissiveness: that docility is rooted in Hungary’s oppressive Communist past, that its democracy was simply too young to withstand a strongman.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Then I returned to the United States, and what I’ve witnessed over these past months at home has exposed those stories as wishful thinking.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Here, too, powerful people are responding to authoritarian advances just as their Hungarian counterparts have — not with defiance, but with capitulation, convinced that they can maintain their independence and stay above the fray.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The lesson of Hungary is this: We cannot claim to care about democracy only when it costs nothing. President Trump, like Mr.&nbsp;Orban, no doubt believes that everyone can be bought. America’s elites are proving him right. There is a Hungarian phrase I heard often: “Van az a penz” — “There’s always a price.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The findings come more than a year after a group of practitioners and researchers wrote the AI Bill of Rights for Educators, which included a call for faculty agency in making choices about “whether, when, and how to use AI based on learning goals, student populations/learning contexts and pedagogical judgment.” But the AAUP’s survey suggests that most colleges and universities aren’t upholding that tenet of AI governance.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Many colleges and universities currently have no meaningful shared governance mechanisms around technology,” read the AAUP’s report. “[T]he explosion of AI has highlighted the need for such mechanisms among faculty members at individual institutions and across the higher education workforce.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“People are terrified of the onslaught of uncritical AI narratives and partnerships across many sectors, and what it means for the future,” Britt Paris, co-author of the report and associate professor of library and information science at Rutgers University, said in an email to Inside Higher Ed. “But in talking with higher education workers across the country, we on the committee have seen that AI in higher education is barely even functional and tech companies view higher education as a cash cow to exploit.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To avoid some of those potential downsides, the report recommended that universities gather input from faculty, staff and students before making deals with tech companies—and write liability clauses into the contracts they do procure. It also called for institutions to give faculty members, staff and students the right to opt-out of technology use without negatively affecting their working or learning conditions, as well as allowing faculty to challenge the implementation of certain ed tech products if the benefit isn’t clear.</p>

<p>Government lawyers dismissed allegations of an ideologically motivated campaign to detain and deport campus protesters on Monday, comparing assertions that the Trump administration curtailed the free-speech rights of noncitizens to the fictional character Don Quixote.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Plaintiffs, including the American Association of University Professors and the Middle East Studies Association, argue that the March arrests of pro-Palestinian activists on student visas and green cards led other international students and scholars to think twice about speaking out on controversial issues. Academics testified that they had rewritten syllabi, withdrawn op-eds, and canceled research trips out of fear that they, too, could face retribution for expressing political opinions.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The goal is to chill speech, to silence students and scholars who wish to express pro-Palestinian views,” Alexandra Conlon, a lawyer for the academic groups, said during closing arguments. “It is stifling dissent.”</p>

<p>But Ethan B. Kanter, another lawyer representing the Trump administration, countered that noncitizens’ speech rights are “context dependent.” As an example, he pointed to federal campaign-finance law, which prohibits donations from foreign nationals. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that campaign spending is protected speech under the First Amendment. The campaign restrictions underscore that “not in every instance” do noncitizens have “equivalent rights,” Kanter said.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="funding-cuts">Funding cuts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Inside the powerful task force spearheading Trump’s assault on colleges, DEI</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/18/antisemitism-task-force-dei-universities-trump/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/18/antisemitism-task-force-dei-universities-trump/</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The administration established the task force in February to counter what it describes as widespread failure by universities to protect Jewish students since the start of campus protests against the Israel-Gaza war. In reality, many of the task force’s unprecedented demands and punishments have nothing to do with antisemitism. Instead, they seek hiring and programming changes to strip long-standing conservative targets including DEI and a liberal worldview from higher education.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It’s self-evident it’s not about antisemitism,” said Yehuda Kurtzer, president of the Shalom Hartman Institute, a Jerusalem-based research and educational center focused on world Jewish life and pluralism. “Why would that have anything to do with cutting funding for research? It’s about conservative fears of higher education, and antisemitism is an excuse.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The work — which at times has ignored legal norms and procedures — is driven by the task force, made up of senior officials in the Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services departments, as well as the little-known General Services Administration. Since almost the start of Trump’s second term, they have invoked both antisemitism and DEI in a quest to transform the culture of campuses and stamp out what many Republicans see as outright hostility to conservative values, discourse and thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One task force member said it makes sense to create a “global settlement” with universities that would encompass a range of alleged violations. Task force investigations sometimes start out examining allegations of antisemitism, this person said, but then identify what members see as other concerns, such as race-conscious admissions, which the Supreme Court has ruled are unconstitutional.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To push colleges to comply, the administration has frozen billions of dollars in federal funding to at least six highly selective universities — notably Harvard and Columbia, which have seen the highest-profile federal cuts — but also Cornell, Northwestern, Brown and Princeton.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One targeted school, Brown University, said its funding was cut without “any formal notification or explanation” from the federal government and “in spite of Brown’s cooperation with multiple government reviews and our compliance with the law.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The public face is Leo Terrell … Terrell posts on social media throughout the day, echoing some of the right’s most incendiary and baseless claims. He also rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, often simply posting “I hate DEI” and tagging people of color with whom he disagrees as DEI hires. … He’s also echoed antisemitic comments…Multiple people said Terrell has little experience in the type of legal work the task force is undertaking and is not involved in its day-to-day legal strategy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Much of the task force’s work is being shepherded by lower-profile senior administration officials: Tom Wheeler and Sean Keveney, the acting general counsels of the departments of Education and Health and Human Services, and Gruenbaum from the General Services…Harmeet Dhillon directly oversees the group’s work…Dhillon and her political team scour social media to identify instances of antisemitism and determine what investigations to launch.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The legal basis for the crackdown on universities centers on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in programs or activities — including universities — that receive federal funding. … Under the law, she said, “withdrawal of federal funds is treated as a last resort action.” … In several high-profile cases, the Trump task force has skipped all these steps.</p>

<p>The Trump administration’s cancellation of federal funds for highly selective universities in blue states has drawn national media attention.

<p>“Institutions affected by grant terminations range from some of the country’s largest public universities to private research universities, small liberal arts colleges, and community colleges,” the report says.

<p>A decade ago, over 200 college campuses shuttered in a two-year period, leaving thousands of students in the lurch. … In 2022, the organization that accredited many of the campuses run by those companies — the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, or ACICS — was effectively shut down by the U.S. Department of Education for not responding to the concerns.

<p>In a courtroom in Boston on Monday, a lawyer for Harvard called the Trump administration’s case against the school “cooked up.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A federal judge appeared deeply skeptical on Monday of the Trump administration’s efforts to strip Harvard University of billions of dollars in research funding, suggesting the school might prevail in its legal battle against the government.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Judge Allison D. Burroughs did not issue a ruling during a crucial hearing, which lasted more than two hours in her courtroom in Boston. But she did seem receptive to Harvard’s arguments, as both the school and the government sought to have the case decided in their favor without a trial.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“You’re saying you can terminate a contract for any and all reasons, even if the reason you’re giving is a violation of the Constitution?” Judge Burroughs asked Mr.&nbsp;Velchik [team Govt] at one point, her doubts made clear by her tone. At another moment, she said, “I don’t think you can justify a contract action based on impermissible suppression of speech.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Judge Burroughs seemed to share the worries of Mr.&nbsp;Lehotsky, who said the government was pursuing an “anti-Harvard policy” that would be unlawful under any president.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“What I’m wrestling with is this idea that the executive branch can decide what is discriminatory or racist,” she said, and then make “these ad hoc decisions without any procedure around it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>President Trump, in a social media post after the hearing, called Judge Burroughs “a TOTAL DISASTER, which I say even before hearing her Ruling.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>He also criticized Harvard, and reiterated promises to end its federal funds. “When she rules against us, we will IMMEDIATELY appeal, and WIN,” he wrote of Judge Burroughs. “Also, the Government will stop the practice of giving many Billions of Dollars to Harvard, much of which had been given without explanation.”</p>

<p>In economic history, we teach the 1688 creation of parliamentary supremacy as a solution to what economists call “commitment problems.” In the absence of a third party sufficiently strong to make sure all sides stick to their promises, the powerful can renege on the powerless. The powerless, seeing this, wisely choose to not contract with the powerful. Absolutist rulers are victims of their own lack of restraints; a sovereign who is too powerful cannot get inexpensive credit, because nothing stops the ruler from defaulting on any bond. President Trump, by smashing checks on his authority, has wound up undermining his own ability to make credible deals, including the one just reached with Columbia University, where I teach.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But this deal is unlikely to end the attacks. The federal government, and this administration, is simply too powerful and too arbitrary to be credibly bargained with. Do we really think this arrangement, however destructive of academic autonomy it is, will prevent the Trump administration from stopping the money again? Anyone who thinks the administration will mutely walk away after the ink is dry needs to look at both the past behavior of autocratic regimes in general and this administration’s in particular.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It is unsurprising that a coalition of election deniers, Christian nationalists and supplement- and crypto-hawkers would have little regard for academic freedom, scientific progress and learning.

<p>The Columbia University Board of Trustees’ concessions to the Trump administration are a disaster for Columbia students, faculty, and staff, as well as for academic freedom, freedom of speech, and the independence of colleges and universities nationwide. Never in the history of our nation has an educational institution so thoroughly bent to the will of an autocrat. The settlement will only fuel Trump’s authoritarian appetite to control other democratic institutions that could potentially rein him in.

<p>Allowing the government to monitor and ultimately dictate decisions about the hiring of faculty and admission of students is a stunning breach of the independence of colleges and universities and opens the door for the ideological control this administration so eagerly craves.

Trump has already reached into community colleges, public state schools, small liberal arts colleges, and minority serving institutions to limit the free expression of students and workers. The Columbia settlement will embolden the administration to further clamp down throughout higher education.</p>

<p>Columbia’s capitulation “represents the upending of a decades-long partnership between the government and higher education in which colleges and universities nevertheless retained academic freedom, institutional autonomy and shared governance,” said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities. “It signals a rise in authoritarian populism in which higher education is positioned as the enemy in a fight against corrupt, inefficient and elite institutions that are out of touch with the needs of the working class.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Whether you applaud or despise the terms of the deal, the way in which the government is operating, and getting universities like Columbia to make these deals is fundamentally coercive,” said David Pozen, a constitutional law professor at Columbia. “Therefore, it poses a significant threat to the future of higher education as well as the rule of law.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">

<blockquote class="blockquote">

<p>Michael Thaddeus, a Columbia math professor and president of the faculty union chapter, said though administrators insist they won’t allow the government to interfere, that assurance doesn’t mean such acts won’t occur. “Students and scholars at American universities must be free to think and speak their minds,” he wrote in a statement to Inside Higher Ed. “The settlement … risks imperiling this freedom.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Pozen, the Columbia law professor, outlined in a blog post Wednesday night how the task force bypassed nearly all statutory requirements of such an investigation. … “The means being used to push through these reforms are as unprincipled as they are unprecedented,” Pozen wrote. “Higher education policy in the United States is now being developed through ad hoc deals, a mode of regulation that is not only inimical to the ideal of the university as a site of critical thinking but also corrosive to the democratic order and to law itself.”</p>

<p>Columbia will see at least a partial restoration of federal research funds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The agreement will close pending investigations or compliance reviews related to potential violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race or national origin. That includes a probe by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission into the treatment of Jewish employees at Columbia. Of the $221 million settlement, $21 million will go toward the EEOC complaint.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Columbia will maintain policies announced in March that deem protests inside of academic buildings and related spaces to be a “direct impediment” to the university’s academic mission.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The agreement codifies changes to disciplinary processes announced in March, such as placing the University Judicial Board under the Office of the Provost who reports to the president. Students previously served on the board, but now, it will be restricted to faculty and staff members.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, a frequent target of the Trump administration, are also included in the agreement. The deal bars Columbia from maintaining “programs that promote unlawful efforts to achieve race-based outcomes, quotas, diversity targets, or similar efforts.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The agreement emphasizes merit-based admissions and bars Columbia from giving preference to applicants due to “race, color, or national origin.” It also prevents Columbia from using personal statements, diversity narratives or references to race “to introduce or justify discrimination.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Maintaining a senior vice provost to provide greater administrative oversight of Middle East studies (and other regional programs), as initially announced in March, is also part of the agreement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As part of the deal, a third-party resolution monitor will police the agreement. Bart Schwartz, co-founder of Guidepost Solutions and former Chief of the Criminal Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, will serve in that role.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The deal also places restrictions on university hiring processes. Columbia’s agreement will bar the use of “personal statements, diversity narratives, or any applicant reference to racial identity as a means to introduce or justify discriminatory practices in hiring or promotion.” Other unspecified “indirect methods or criteria that serve as a substitute for race conscious hiring or promotion practices” are also prohibited per the deal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While some elements of the agreement are new, other parts simply codify prior changes. For example, changes to disciplinary processes, and greater administrative oversight of Middle East studies (and other regional programs) already announced in March are now codified in the deal.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Columbia also consents to making sure that all students, international and domestic, are “committed to the longstanding traditions of American universities,” including free inquiry, open debate, and the “fundamental values” of equality and respect. It will create training materials so that students understand campus norms and values.

<p>And that’s also why I’m outraged by Columbia University’s agreement yesterday with the Trump administration. There’s no other way to put it: Columbia abandoned free and open dialogue — the most fundamental principle of academic life — to save its own skin.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But here’s the problem: Reasonable people disagree about what kinds of statements and behaviors constitute anti-Jewish hatred. And Columbia has effectively placed that disagreement out of bounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>So let’s suppose a professor declares that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, like the Nazis did in Europe. Would Columbia declare the statement antisemitic and subject the professor to disciplinary action? How about a staff member who says that “Zionism is racism”? Or a student who chants, “From the river to the sea, Palestine must be free”? You might view all of these statements as antisemitic. And depending on who is talking and listening, I might agree with you.</p>

<li>George Mason President Discriminated Against White People After George Floyd Protests, Justice Dept. Says</li>

<p>The Justice Department on Thursday launched an investigation into George Mason University and its president, Gregory Washington, to determine if administrators discriminated against white male faculty and job applicants on the basis of race and sex in the aftermath of the George Floyd protests.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In a June 2020 email, when universities across the country were responding to the murder of George Floyd by looking for ways to address historic racial disparities on their campuses, Washington said he would make changes to the promotion and tenure processes that “recognize the invisible and uncredited emotional labor that people of color expend to learn, teach, discover, and work on campus.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Christopher F. Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the mastermind behind the moral panic over “critical race theory,” has cemented his reputation as a relentless opponent of diversity, equity, and inclusion in higher education.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>His hostility to DEI is matched by his influence among GOP decision-makers. He has organized campaigns against Claudine Gay, Harvard University’s first Black president, as well as several other Black administrators and faculty members at Harvard and other elite institutions. He helped oust Patricia Okker as president of New College of Florida and advocated for dismantling its Office of Outreach &amp; Inclusive Excellence. Most recently, he led a successful campaign against Santa J. Ono, who was running to be the next president of the University of Florida.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Rufo’s playbook is now being used against Virginia’s public universities, with Gov.&nbsp;Glenn A. Youngkin, a Republican, setting the table for a federal takedown. Youngkin’s strategy has two main parts. First, he has appointed political ideologues to university governing boards and encouraged them to impose their ideology to remake higher education in Virginia. Second, alongside the attorney general, he has weakened public universities’ ability to respond to federal investigations that threaten the very mission of their institutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We recently watched this play out at the University of Virginia, where Youngkin-appointed board members and conservative alumni groups demanded the removal of all traces of DEI programs from the campus. Then came the Department of Justice investigation led by Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for the civil-rights division, and her deputy, Gregory W. Brown, both of whom are graduates of UVa. With the board unwilling to defend him and the threat that the university would lose millions of federal dollars, UVa’s president, James E. Ryan, resigned. Existential terror, indeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>First, over the past three years, George Mason has faced significant criticism from the staff of the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Education Policy, which has been led by Lindsey M. Burke for over eight years. Recently, Burke was appointed to the U.S. Department of Education. When she was chair of the George Mason board’s Academic Affairs Committee, Burke leveraged criticism from her colleagues at Heritage to justify her ongoing attacks on the university’s curriculum and its commitment to DEI.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The same strategy was employed to incorporate the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism into George Mason’s nondiscrimination policy without knowledge or input from faculty members. George Mason adopted this contentious definition, which critics argue conflates antisemitism with criticism of the State of Israel, under the influence of Kenneth Marcus, a former member of the university’s Board of Visitors who was appointed by Youngkin. (Marcus’s appointment has since been denied by the Democratic-controlled Virginia Legislature.) Marcus is also credited with facilitating the adoption of the IHRA definition at Harvard and Columbia. His overarching goal is to embed the IHRA definition in university discrimination policies nationwide, silencing criticism of Israel and suppressing speech in support of the Palestinian people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On that same day, July 2, City Journal, a publication of the Manhattan Institute, published a column by Ian Kingsbury, a senior fellow at the Educational Freedom Institute, titled “George Mason University’s Disastrous President.” Citing a debunked Heritage-authored anti-DEI study and the Education Department’s threadbare allegations of antisemitism on campus, Kingsbury called for Washington’s ouster.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The interconnections among the players in this little piece of political theater boggle the mind. For example, the Heritage Foundation’s Jay P. Greene wrote the report, since debunked by George Mason administrators, on “DEI bloat” that Kingsbury cited in his City Journal hit piece. It turns out that Jay Greene was a member of Kingsbury’s doctoral committee, and they frequently collaborate on articles. Greene is also a fellow at the Education Freedom Institute, where Lindsey Burke once served as a board member. Until recently, Greene also worked for Burke at the Heritage Foundation. Around and around we go.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On July 3, the right-wing site Liberty Unyielding published a critique of George Mason … On July 4, National Review published a piece by George Leef, director of external affairs at the conservative James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal, referencing the Liberty Unyielding story … Based on this circular, self-referential discourse, Bacon’s Rebellion, a conservative political blog run by James A. Bacon, then posted an article predicting that George Mason could be the next university to be investigated by the Department of Justice</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>All of this is part of the strategy Rufo laid bare in an interview with Politico — publish relentless character assassination attacks in right-wing media until mainstream outlets feel they can no longer ignore the allegations, however specious or trivial.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Let’s be clear: This campaign against George Mason and its president isn’t about antisemitism or so-called reverse racism. It’s about political control — plain and simple. … They don’t want independent thought — they seek obedience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This is the Rufo doctrine in action: fabricate a crisis, flood the zone with misinformation, start coordinated media attacks, trigger federal investigations, and force institutions to collapse under the weight of bad-faith pressure. It worked at UVa. They want it to work at George Mason. If we allow it to happen again, we’re not just losing a president — we’re handing over the keys of public higher education to a political movement that views knowledge as a threat and diversity as a sin.</p>

<p>SuperShelf is one of the thousands of initiatives funded by grants from the Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education, or SNAP-Ed. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed this month, eliminates funding for SNAP-Ed, effective September 30, leaving Durgan and hundreds of researchers and educators scrambling to figure out what these cuts mean for their institutions, and the communities they serve.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The University of Minnesota announced July 7 that it would not renew the contracts of 59 educators who work in its extension. The federal program isn’t the extension’s only source of funds, but Durgan said she expects more layoffs as the fall approaches. “We served over 173,000 individuals last year with this program and most of it will be ending at the end of September,” Durgan said. “It just will.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Jennifer McCaffrey, assistant dean for the family and consumer sciences programs at the University of Illinois Extension, said she expects many partner organizations to suffer because of the cuts to SNAP-Ed. In Illinois, for example, she said SNAP-Ed is the primary distributor of venison. In the most recent hunting season, it sent 25,000 pounds of the game meat to food pantries statewide, feeding nearly 50,000 families. No other organization has the capacity to carry out such a service, she said, meaning a likely increase in both food waste and hunger across the state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Beyond the partner organizations themselves, McCaffrey said the state’s overall nutrition and health will suffer as well. The extension used SNAP-Ed funding to carry out initiatives named in the state’s health improvement plan, she added. “So we’re unsure where we’re turning to.”</p>
