<h1>Oct 31</h1>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.</p>
<p>Fewer items than previous weeks—perhaps stomping on higher education isn’t an essential service—but still scary enough for Halloween.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When the leaders of the 26-year-old Upward Bound program at SUNY Adirondack received word earlier this fall that the Trump administration had canceled their grant, they were shocked to see the Education Department’s reason for the termination.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the grant application for the college-access program for high school students, they had said they wanted to ensure the program included an equal number of male and female participants, in an effort to address declining male participation in the program. But in the grant termination letter—delivered mid-September, after the program’s annual Sept.&nbsp;1 start date—Department of Education officials said that that line reflected the Biden administration’s priorities and conflicted with the interests of the current administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>According to the Council for Opportunity in Education, the organization that advocates for TRIO programs, about 100 grants were canceled or rejected in September after the department delayed funding for thousands of TRIO grants that were slated to begin on Sept.&nbsp;1. Another 23 programs lost funding earlier in the year. The cancellations represent a small portion of TRIO programs—3 percent—but they affect over 43,600 students who will now be without a slew of resources, from tutoring to assistance with financial aid. Colleges that house these programs have also had to lay off staff members.</p>

<p>Impacts from the recently enacted federal budget law, upcoming appropriations for federal fiscal year 2026 and executive actions since January 2025 risk undermining the strength and competitiveness of New York’s higher education sector and the social and economic benefits it generates, according to a new analysis from State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Almost 308,000 undergraduates in New York received federal Pell Grants in 2022-23; of these, about one-third were students at private IHEs and just over two-thirds studied at public sector institutions.18 The almost 210,000 recipients of Pell Grants in the public sector represented over 48 percent of all SUNY and CUNY degree- and certificate-seeking undergraduate enrollments with nearly 98,000 recipients representing 31.5 percent of such undergraduate enrollments at private IHEs.19</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Conclusion: Recent federal actions threaten New York’s expansive higher education sector’s ability to attract and cultivate talent and conduct the cutting-edge research and development that help spur innovation and economic growth. Limitations to aid and loans, particularly in graduate study, may make pursuit of higher education unaffordable to some, which is especially concerning since higher education costs in the State, apart from tuition at four-year public IHEs, are higher than the nationwide average. This challenge will be compounded by potential declines in international students whose full tuition payments act to subsidize charges paid by New York residents. Additionally, an increased tax on certain endowments could place additional strain on IHEs. In an environment which has become increasingly competitive for both students and research dollars, and has already seen several institutions in the State close, federal actions may hinder the State’s ability to attract talent and pose financial challenges for many of the State’s colleges and universities. Such outcomes may hinder the State’s ability to maintain its competitive advantage in the higher education sector.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has demanded, among other things, that UCLA not enroll “foreign students likely to engage in anti-Western, anti-American, or antisemitic disruptions or harassment.” In the same paragraph, the proposed resolution agreement says UCLA would have to “socialize international students to the norms of a campus dedicated to free inquiry and open debate.”</p>

<p>“Accession to these demands would be to undermine everything that has made the UC the successful engine of social mobility and economic might that it has been for our state,” Anna Markowitz, president of the UCLA Faculty Association, wrote in an email. “It will harm undergraduate learning opportunities, and hamper UC’s ability to be a scholarly leader on the international stage. It enshrines ideology at the heart of the institution rather than decades of empirical and scholarly understanding. We stand against this extortion effort.”</p>

<li>Research Is the U. of Chicago’s Lifeblood. Its Board Is Killing It.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/research-is-the-u-of-chicagos-lifeblood-its-board-is-killing-it">https://www.chronicle.com/article/research-is-the-u-of-chicagos-lifeblood-its-board-is-killing-it</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The University of Chicago is confronting two dangerous crises — one financial, one intellectual. The two are related.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The university’s debt has grown rapidly in recent years. It stands today at around $6 billion, roughly 60 percent of its $10-billion endowment. (For some context, Northwestern University has roughly $3 billion in debt on a $14-billion endowment.) In financial year 2024, Chicago ran a $288-million deficit. These numbers have developed gradually — and then suddenly. The recent sale by the university of its blue-chip Center for Research in Security Prices, founded in 1960, for $375 million — and sold to a business owned by a trustee — is an especially ironic symptom of poor fiscal management.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>How did this happen? The answer lies in a national trend, which even a faculty with the financial expertise of Chicago’s could not resist. This trend is the total power of Boards of Trustees — self-appointed, self-reproducing, and answerable to no discernible public or regulatory scrutiny, not even to the presidents they hire, assess, and fire. Indeed, the growth of the power of the board is one of the most important transformations in American colleges since at least the 1990s.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>University presidents themselves live in the shadow of their boards. A remarkable amount of presidential time goes into meeting board expectations, negotiating board politics, managing board meetings and titrating news of campus tensions to boards. The provost and the deans are left to manage student recruitment, faculty hiring and promotion, curriculum, and campus life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In short, American universities have gradually come to be ruled by the very top of their imperial executive branches, the president and the board. The faculty, whose senates used to constitute a combined version of a legislative and judicial branch on campuses, have long been on the retreat, intimidated by the ballooning cadre of administrators and buffeted by real or imagined fiscal crises. In their diminished state, faculty are now kept busy responding to various student and parent whims about course content, grading, and campus politics. Faculty governance has largely been replaced by a governed faculty.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The number of faculty on university boards of trustees varies from token to zero. The University of Chicago does not list a single faculty member on its board. In fact, there is not even an educator among the 23 (excluding the president), In the face of its debt crisis, how did the University of Chicago decide to proceed?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It threatened to place the Division of the Arts &amp; Humanities on the chopping block (having first clubbed the humanities and arts together last spring) through consolidation of departments and pausing graduate admissions. Here is another paradox: How could the least expensive division in the university, one of its most prestigious, be sacrificed on the altar of fiscal mismanagement? Why destroy something that not only comes cheap but brings immeasurable honor to the university? That’s the sort of decision you get when managers, not faculty, call the shots.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But today’s draconian steps have yet another source. The enthusiasm for putting the humanities on a starvation diet and “pausing” graduate admission represents a steady move away from research as the driver of teaching and professional education toward pedagogy, where fee-paying students are seen as more useful than any research driven by curiosity and a pure devotion to new knowledge. And humanities departments represent the purest form of research itself. The social sciences, medicine, the life sciences, even mathematics, can always claim to have some utilitarian, applied, practical, or monetizable appeal, however obscure or remote. Economics creates policies, markets, and prices; political science claims to decipher elections, war, and peace; mathematics feeds physics, economics, engineering, and much else; law provides the oil for the entire world of contracts, justice, and order; medicine is, by definition, useful. The humanities as a whole, along with their cousins in history and anthropology, embody the luxury goods of pure research — knowledge for self-cultivation, exploration, exhilaration, and conscience. They are the exemplars of the ideals of research, and the conscience of the research impulse across the university. To shrink research at Chicago in favor of teaching, vocation, and utility requires this conscience to be stifled.</p>

<p>Williams College’s faculty council approved revisions to the faculty handbook that removed mentions of affirmative action, references to “racial provisions” in the faculty-hiring process, and language stating that a fellowship was oriented toward “underrepresented groups.” The changes are part of a larger effort to review its compliance with federal regulations, college officials said.</p>

<p>Williams made headlines in July for pausing its acceptance of NIH and NSF grants, which represent a small portion of the small private institution’s revenue.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Inboden: I think we align with the principles of conduct that they want. A lot of that is already a combination of Texas state law and university policy. But of course there’s the question of the procedures — how those would be enforced in the compact. That’s where we’re grateful that the White House is open-minded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Inboden: We’re also governed by the First Amendment and by protections of particular civil liberties. And we’re certainly committed to the cardinal tenets of academic freedom. As written, some of the procedural enforcements of the compact would clash with state law and some of our other institutional prerogatives. But in the main, we’re happy to be having those discussions with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Goldstein: So you’re substantively simpatico but procedurally concerned about enforcement mechanisms and some other aspects?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Inboden: That’s a pretty accurate summary. I don’t want to say too much more because we find these discussions are best had behind the scenes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Goldstein: I’m hearing from UT Austin faculty members, and I would describe the level of anxiety as quite high. Some of them are certain, for instance, that women’s and gender and sexuality studies won’t survive the year. As one person put it to me, “COLA” — the College of Liberal Arts — “is fucked.” How worried should they be?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Inboden: I’m going to keep my part of this interview PG-13.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Inboden: … We’re working on what we’re calling the Texas Statement on Academic Integrity, about academic freedom and teaching responsibilities. A committee of our faculty is putting this together. To be able to teach controversial subjects, that’s what our academic freedom protects, but the integrity with which we exercise that freedom means that when we are teaching about controversial subjects, we do it in a balanced way. That doesn’t mean a faculty member can’t have his or her own views on something. Of course they can. But teaching with balance means that if it’s a contested matter of public concern, we acknowledge that there are other viewpoints, maybe even present what some of the other viewpoints would be in a good-faith way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Inboden: The second principle is doing it in a way that students in the class who may hold a dissenting view from the professor or from other students feel free to voice those views. That they don’t feel intimidated into silence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Inboden: The responsibility of our academic freedom includes exposing students to multiple views. A lot of the public backlash or concern we’re seeing, or even some of the legislative measures, come from a sense that some faculty at some universities have presented these controversial topics in a dogmatic or doctrinaire way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Not sure where that is ever specified as a responsibility of academic freedom, having grown up in the protection from political influence in pursuing free search for truth and its free exposition.)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Goldstein: I’m reminded of the 1915 AAUP “Declaration of Principles on Academic Freedom and Academic Tenure,” which you cite in your article, which says essentially that if faculty don’t police themselves, outside forces will come in and police you. Is the Texas statement an attempt by the university to both set a tone on campus and erect a shield against political intrusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Inboden: I’m glad you mentioned the 1915 AAUP statement. When our academic-integrity statement comes out, you’ll see a lot of it is going to cite a number of precedents: the 1915 AAUP statement, the 1940 AAUP statement, some Supreme Court precedents. And I’ve recently read this fantastic book by David Rabban, one of our UT law professors, on academic freedom that came out last year — the single most magisterial treatment on academic freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Inboden: Academic freedom is a very robust right, but it’s not an unlimited right, and it includes responsibilities: How do we teach students? It doesn’t include the freedom to indoctrinate students. I know that’s a loaded term, but we can appreciate distinctions between teaching and indoctrination. There’s a great century-long tradition of both norms and laws for academic freedom in this country. But it’s all embedded in that deeper social contract between the American people and our universities. That includes universities policing ourselves better and exercising our rights responsibly. If we don’t, political leaders will get more involved, with a more heavy hand.</p>

<li>Northwestern, Cornell Still Working to Unfreeze Federal Funds</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Since March, the Trump administration has said that it put nearly $6 billion on hold at nine universities. Three universities—Columbia, Penn and Brown—cut deals with the administration to restore the funding, while the University of California, Los Angeles, and Harvard got the money back via court orders. The fate of the remaining four freezes—at Duke, Cornell, Northwestern and Princeton Universities—remains uncertain.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>At Northwestern, the Trump administration reportedly froze about $790 million in early April, though officials said at the time they never received formal notification about why the funds were put on hold. Since then, Northwestern officials have said they are working to restore the grants—a process that apparently hasn’t gone smoothly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Northwestern University interim president Henry Bienen told The Daily Northwestern in an Oct.&nbsp;17 interview that “a negotiation really requires two parties, at least, and at the present time, there’s not been anybody on the other end of the line.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As the freeze persists, Northwestern has said it will continue to support researchers’ “essential funding needs” at least through the end of the calendar year. Bienen told the student newspaper that supporting the research costs $30 million to $40 million a month.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Cornell University is also in talks with the administration to find a solution to the freeze. However, President Michael Kotlikoff recently shared new information about the impact of the freeze that calls into question the Trump administration’s figures.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Trump officials told media outlets in April that they froze more than $1 billion at Cornell. But Kotlikoff said last week in his State of the University address that Cornell is actually facing about $250 million in canceled or unpaid research funds. (The university’s research expenditures totaled $1.6 billion in the 2023–24 academic year.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>… Bloomberg reported that the White House wanted to reach a $100 million settlement with Cornell. … “I want to be clear that there are established procedures in place for the government to handle such concerns,” he [Cornell President] said in his State of the University address. “Accusations of discrimination should be supported by, and adjudicated on the basis of, facts. This has not happened.”</p>

<p>For Mr.&nbsp;Trump, the common thread weaving together so much of what he does — at home and abroad — is power. Whether he is seeking a cease-fire in Gaza or Ukraine, bombing boats off the coast of Venezuela or deploying troops to American cities, the desired result is his personal aggrandizement and the empowerment of his presidency. When he pursues peace, it is personalized — a deal made with other strongmen rarely addresses underlying causes of conflict. When he makes war, it is also personalized — there is no expectation, for instance, that Congress must authorize his actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Over the past several months, events overseas have served as pretexts for power grabs within the United States. The Trump administration has used the war in Gaza as an excuse to crush free speech for pro-Palestinian protesters and compel certain universities to submit to federal dictates. Before the first boat was blown out of the water, the administration was deporting immigrants, citing the 1798 Alien Enemies Act — the justification being that we were being invaded by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, a group few Americans could name before it became omnipresent on Fox News. When Americans protested those deportation policies, Mr.&nbsp;Trump deployed the military to American cities to restore “order.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>… Ultimately, this is not peace — it is a world without the rules established after World War II to prevent a return of the lethal mix of authoritarianism and aggression that is once again ascendant. That kind of world can seem orderly for a time. On a particular day, it might even appear more peaceful. But history shows that when might makes right, things go terribly wrong.</p>

<p>This context is essential to evaluate why the administration has sung such a different tune with the advertised $60,000 student loan forgiveness offers to new ICE recruits, compared to the normal song and dance about how higher education is evil incarnate. Trump and his political allies didn’t suddenly discover the societal benefits of affordable education, as evidenced by his simultaneous efforts to strip loan forgiveness pathways from those who are deemed obstructors to Trump’s political goals.

<p>Cal State, the largest U.S. university system with 460,000 students, recently embarked on a public-private campaign — with corporate titans including Amazon, OpenAI and Nvidia — to position the school as the nation’s “first and largest A.I.-empowered” university. One central goal is to make generative A.I. tools, which can produce humanlike texts and images, available across the school’s 22 campuses. Cal State also wants to embed chatbots in teaching and learning, and prepare students for “increasingly A.I.-driven” careers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As part of the effort, the university is paying OpenAI $16.9 million to provide ChatGPT Edu, the company’s tool for schools, to more than half a million students and staff — which OpenAI heralded as the world’s largest rollout of ChatGPT to date. Cal State also set up an A.I. committee, whose members include representatives from a dozen large tech companies, to help identify the skills California employers need and improve students’ career opportunities.</p>

<p>Last spring, it became clear to me that over half the students in my large general education lecture course had used artificial intelligence tools, contrary to my explicit policy, to write their final take-home exams. (Ironically, the course was titled Contemporary Moral Problems: The Value of Human Life.) I had asked them about some very recent work in philosophy, parts of which happened to share titles with entirely different ideas in medieval theology.

<p>To leave our students to their own devices — which is to say, to the devices of A.I. companies — is to deprive them of indispensable opportunities to develop their linguistic mastery, and with it their most elementary powers of thought.

<p>As students’ A.I. use has proliferated, many of its critics focused on intellectual gifts. “A.I. undermines the human value of attention,” the poet Meghan O’Rourke wrote in a guest essay for Times Opinion, “and the individuality that flows from that.” Other endangered powers: “unique human expression,” “the slow deliberation of critical thinking” and the “ability to write original and interesting sentences.” As a humanities professor, all these concerns resonate with me.</p>

<p>Libraries worldwide are exploring or ramping up their use of artificial intelligence, according to a new report by Clarivate, a global information services company.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The report, released Thursday, based its findings on a survey of over 2,000 librarians across 109 countries and regions. Most respondents, 77 percent, worked at academic libraries. The survey found that 67 percent of libraries were exploring or implementing AI this year, up from 63 percent last year; 35 percent were still in the evaluation stage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Somehow I find this all a bit hard to believe, except for this:) DOE &gt; However, AI adoption, and optimism, varied by region. For example, U.S. libraries lagged in AI implementation, and only 7 percent of librarians surveyed said they felt optimistic about it;</p>

<li>Why More Colleges Should Focus on Knitting</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/career-advice/teaching/2023/04/19/teaching-students-handwork-knitting-offers-many-benefits">https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/career-advice/teaching/2023/04/19/teaching-students-handwork-knitting-offers-many-benefits</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Why do I find knitting so relevant to my teaching? Because learning is so much more than learning skills and acquiring knowledge. It is also about the rote practice that gets learning into your muscles and brain; it is about making mistakes and fixing mistakes; it is about apprenticeship and becoming a member of a community. When thinking about knitting, learning is not just acquiring the knowledge and skills that knitters have; it is equally about taking on the identity of a knitter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Knitters know, for example, that if they try to learn too far out of what is their next step, it will probably miss the mark. They know that they learn particular skills, practice them and usually learn more quickly and effectively in both in-person and virtual knitting communities. Specifically, they know that they learn well by literally sitting next to one another, watching and trying and practicing—and sometimes having someone hold their hands through the moves.</p>
