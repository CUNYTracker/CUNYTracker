<p>While nearly half of respondents (46 percent) indicated they have “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in public institutions, only 30 percent reported the same for private institutions. Despite the public’s declining confidence in institutions of higher education, 76 percent of Americans think a college education is very or somewhat important for success. Ninety percent of Democrats, 71 percent of Republicans and 72 percent of Independents agree that a college education is at least somewhat important.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” is an extinction-level event for higher education that would annihilate the country’s intellectual potential.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For colleges and universities, the potential fallout is hard to overstate. Whatever schools survive are likely to be drained of working- and middle-class families, instead populated only by society’s most wealthy. As it is, millions of people rightly consider universities to be a costly endeavor that is irrelevant to their everyday life. But rather than remaking higher ed into a vibrant and more democratic institution, this bill threatens to do the opposite. It will cement the stereotype of higher education as an elite institution into an ironclad reality. On June 25, student debtors and their allies will be protesting these devastating cuts in Washington, D.C. But so far, very few elected officials are sounding the alarm on these issues with the fever pitch they deserve, let alone doing the work required to slow down and obstruct their passage into law.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the words of influential conservative activist Christopher Rufo, “Reforming the student loan programs could put the whole university sector into a significant recession” and state of “existential terror.” The goal is to use economic policy to impose an unpopular and stifling ideological agenda, exacted by punitive student debt.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>These cuts won’t just harm students who rely on loans to afford college; they will take the doors off colleges’ and universities’ capacity to expand minds and redistribute opportunity. Lost revenue will encourage schools to close programs, squeeze staff, and perhaps shutter entirely. A proposed endowment tax for colleges and universities has prompted fury among higher education lobbyists, but those players have said very little about the bill’s vigorous imposition of debt as a tool of social control.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Contemporary Republicans are even more brazen. Consider a recent report released by the Heritage Foundation that recommends terminating higher education “subsidies” and student loan cancellation in order to “increase the married birthrate.” What does this goulash mean in plain English?</p>

<p>Officials are restricting education about diversity and criticism of the U.S. It’s an erosion of rights within the institutions training America’s future military officers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A week into his second presidential term, Donald Trump issued an executive order banning service academies under the Defense Department—the U.S Military Academy at West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Air Force Academy—from “promoting, advancing, or otherwise inculcating the following un-American, divisive, discriminatory, radical, extremist, and irrational theories.” The theories listed were “divisive concepts,” “gender ideology,” race or sex “stereotyping” and “scapegoating,” and the idea “that America’s founding documents are racist or sexist.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Times also reported that Christopher Barth, West Point’s senior librarian, is resigning after 14 years amid demands that he identify books that might violate Hegseth’s order. West Point didn’t answer most questions that Inside Higher Ed posed to it, including whether books have actually been removed.</p>

<p>At the Naval Academy, Tom McCarthy resigned from his role as history department chair this month, The Baltimore Sun reported. The Naval Academy confirmed his resignation letter to Inside Higher Ed.</p>

<li>‘A Banner Year for Censorship’: More States Are Restricting Classroom Discussions on Race and Gender</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Teaching social work in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Cassandra E. Simon often assigns readings that describe how the families her students might one day serve have been impacted by more than a century of housing, employment, and education discrimination. The associate professor has encouraged her students to engage in spirited discussions about race, even assigning a project in which they advocate for or against a social-justice issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Doing any of those things today, she argues in a federal lawsuit, could get her fired from the state flagship, where she’s taught for 25 years. Last year, the state’s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, signed into law a sweeping bill that restricts what professors can teach about race. If any of their lessons veer into what conservative politicians have deemed “divisive concepts,” faculty members risk being reported, investigated, and potentially fired.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But over the past two years, more than a dozen laws have been enacted that either limit which classes can be taught or imposed restrictions on what professors can say in the classroom, according to a Chronicle analysis of state legislation and a compilation of what PEN America calls “educational gag orders.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This year especially “has been a banner year for censorship at a state level across the country,” said Amy B. Reid, senior manager at PEN America’s Freedom to Learn program. “The point of a lot of these restrictions is to put people on guard, worried that anything or everything could be prohibited so you really have to watch what you say.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Senate Bill 37 says that only an institution’s governing board can create a faculty council or senate. If a board decides to keep one, the college or university president gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary” and prescribe how the body conducts meetings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Unless the institution’s board decides otherwise, faculty governing bodies must shrink to no more than 60 members. The Texas A&amp;M University Faculty Senate currently has 122.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The 60 members must include at least two representatives from each of the colleges and schools that comprise the institution—including what the law describes vaguely as “one member appointed by the president or chief executive officer of the institution,” with the rest elected by the faculty of the particular school or college. This could mean that half of a faculty senate would be chosen by the president, barring an exemption by the institution’s board.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>SB 37 also says an institution’s provost can recommend to the president that members be “immediately removed” for failing to attend meetings or not conducting their “responsibilities within the council’s or senate’s parameters,” or for “similar misconduct.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Trump administration has privately demanded that the University of Virginia oust its president to help resolve a Justice Department investigation into the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, according to three people briefed on the matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The extraordinary condition the Justice Department has put on the school demonstrates that President Trump’s bid to shift the ideological tilt of the higher education system, which he views as hostile to conservatives, is more far-reaching than previously understood.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Justice Department officials have told University of Virginia officials that hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding are at risk because of what the department says is the school’s disregard for civil rights law over its diversity practices, according to two of the people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The demand to remove Mr.&nbsp;Ryan was made over the past month on several occasions by Gregory Brown, the deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harmeet K. Dhillon, the Justice Department’s top civil rights lawyer, has also been involved in negotiations with the university.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Before becoming the University of Virginia’s president, Mr.&nbsp;Ryan served as the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he was praised for his commitment to D.E.I. programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The administration’s attempt to assert federal influence over state university leadership decisions is also illustrative of how Mr.&nbsp;Trump’s political appointees continue to wield the Justice Department’s investigative powers to achieve policy goals long sought by a top Trump adviser, Stephen Miller.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But Mr.&nbsp;Ryan has been singled out by the Trump administration as his steps toward compliance have been criticized by conservative groups as insufficient. America First Legal, a nonprofit started by Mr.&nbsp;Miller, last month accused the University of Virginia of paying lip service to Mr.&nbsp;Trump’s orders by simply running the same diversity programs under a different name. The group issued a news release last month that called on the Justice Department to “hold UVA accountable.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Last year, a little-known office in the U.S. Department of Labor helped Black workers at a Texas medical center recover $900,000 in back wages, and Black workers at a Caterpillar manufacturing plant in Illinois recover $800,000, each time over allegations that those applicants lost out on jobs because of their race. Called the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, this division investigates and fights employment discrimination for one-fifth of the U.S. labor force. It was created in 1965 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an executive order strengthening the provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned racial discrimination by employers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On his second day in office, President Donald Trump labeled O.F.C.C.P.’s efforts to enforce the 1964 Civil Rights Act illegal and discriminatory — presumably against white people. He signed his own executive order revoking Johnson’s on behalf of, as he put it, “hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American dream.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yet in the opening months of his second term, Trump has capitalized on the unpopularity of equality efforts among some Americans, glibly wielding the language of D.E.I. to initiate the broadest and most significant assault on civil rights and racial integration in this country in more than a century.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Conservatives have spent decades chipping away both at civil rights protections and the national will to address racial inequality. Since the racial reckoning of 2020, Republicans have toppled affirmative action in college admissions and waged an enormously successful campaign to make the language of equity and inclusion anathema, to label books and lessons about the nation’s history “anti-white” and “divisive” and to prohibit everything from Black studies to university diversity offices. And earlier this month, the Supreme Court, which over the years has made it increasingly challenging for Black Americans to prove discrimination, has now made it easier for straight white people to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Education Department sent a letter to all educational institutions receiving federal funds asserting without evidence that they were engaging in “pervasive and repugnant race-based” discrimination against white and Asian students. Federal data shows that Black students are disproportionately concentrated in schools with fewer resources and less funding, and experience significant academic disparities. And yet the letter told public schools and universities that they had 14 days to purge all diversity and equity efforts — which include programs that try to help diversify teaching staffs and help Black students close the achievement gaps they suffer from nationwide — or lose access to federal funds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But probably the starkest change is the redirecting of the Department of Justice away from fighting anti-Black discrimination and toward eliminating integration efforts. Harmeet Dhillon, the new head of the department’s Civil Rights Division, sent a memo to the staff making it clear the mandate going forward would be to enforce Trump’s executive orders targeting diversity programs.</p>

<p>The frustration added to broader discontent at HUD, the backbone of the federal government’s housing policy.

<p>It is unclear how close both sides are to a potential deal and the exact terms any final agreement would entail. In a post on Truth Social, Mr.&nbsp;Trump said it was “very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harvard has been widely praised by Democrats, academics, its alumni and democracy advocates for fighting the Trump administration.

<p>In exchange, Harvard would agree to take even more aggressive action than it already has to address issues such as antisemitism, race, and viewpoint diversity.

<p>The White House, according to one person briefed on the negotiations, hopes that an agreement with Harvard might serve as a framework for other elite colleges to strike deals with Mr.&nbsp;Trump. Other schools have been in discussions with the Trump administration about making deals that would keep their federal funding intact and avoid the president’s ire, two of the people said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Among other conditions, the administration wanted Harvard to establish “merit based” hiring and admissions policies, and to see the influence of its faculty curbed. It sought a review for “viewpoint diversity,” the shutdown of any programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, and an outside review to examine “those programs and departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The government also asked for Harvard to adjust its “recruitment, screening and admissions of international students,” audits of university data and reports “at least until the end of 2028” about the university’s compliance with the Trump administration’s conditions.</p>

<p>District Judge Allison Burroughs granted a preliminary injunction to Harvard University on Friday in its case challenging the Trump administration’s efforts to prevent the university from enrolling international students.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The injunction prevents the Department of Homeland Security from stripping Harvard of its Student Exchange and Visitor Program certification until Burroughs issues a final ruling in the lawsuit. It does not address President Donald Trump’s executive proclamation from earlier this month banning the State Department from issuing visas to international students and researchers attending Harvard; a temporary restriction on that ban expired June 20.</p>

<p>Larry Summers: Maybe, but there are countervailing forces. Harvard’s relative prestige rises with the square of the distance from Cambridge, and so a global talent competition helps it. The greatest universities are drivers of progress. The 21st century will be a center of the life sciences, and because of Harvard, M.I.T. and their affiliates, Boston and Cambridge are ground zero, creating a flywheel effect with Stanford and digital technology. If anything, the trend is toward a higher fraction of government, business, artistic elites coming from elite schools as they get better at drawing talent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Summers: The trend could break if Trump stays super-destructive, courts are super-tolerant and the universities don’t adapt and settle. That is a real worry. My best guess, though, is that the need for universities as economic engines, the enforcement of law and the fact that there is low-hanging fruit for cultural correction in the universities will carry the day. I don’t think there is yet evidence of leading universities losing their appeal. Yes, there is a need to walk back from crazy, as there was after the 1960s. My guess is this will happen. You will see versions of Stanford’s Hoover Institution on many campuses, more emphasis on nonideological science and a big walk back on identity politics.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harvard University, battered by a devastating conflict with the Trump administration that has jeopardized its elite standing, is facing a problem as it weighs a possible truce with President Trump: how to strike a deal without compromising its values or appearing to have capitulated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Unlike many other powerful institutions that have struck bargains with Mr.&nbsp;Trump, Harvard, the nation’s oldest and richest university, spent much of this spring as the vanguard of resistance to the White House, credited by academic leaders, alumni and pro-democracy activists for fighting the administration and serving as a formidable barrier against authoritarianism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Despite a series of legal wins against the administration, though, Harvard officials concluded in recent weeks that those victories alone might be insufficient to protect the university.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Lee C. Bollinger, a former president of Columbia University and the University of Michigan, said that Harvard stood at a critical juncture in the history of American academia.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“How you conduct yourself in these moments will say a lot over the future,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>He warned that allowing the government a say in hiring was a perilous threat to “a core, core academic freedom principle.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Trump administration is ramping up negotiations with Harvard University in an effort to reach an end to its months-long battle with the elite school, two senior White House officials have said, as Harvard has been racking up legal wins in court.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The administration expects a deal to land by the end of the month, one official said, and hopes the agreement would make a big enough splash to “basically be a blueprint for the rest of higher education.” The White House officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harvard declined to comment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harvard allies, free-speech advocates and others have feared that the Trump administration would use its attacks on Harvard to exert control over universities nationwide and dismantle academic freedom. Whatever the outcome, the case will create a significant precedent, said higher education attorney Sarah Hartley.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“This is the playbook to be used with other universities by the government going forward,” said Hartley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm BCLP. “It, in many ways, is being used as a test of democracy and what the government can force on private institutions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The government may have more motivation to come to a settlement outside of court than Harvard does, said higher education attorney Jodie Ferise, who believes Harvard has a stronger legal case.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The White House has every incentive to want to reach some kind of compromise, because I don’t think they’ll win this case,” she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The government cannot attempt a hostile takeover of any private institution, much less a private college or university, in order to impose its preferred vision of ideological balance,” the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in a brief filed with seven other organizations, including the right-leaning Cato Institute and Rutherford Institute.</p>

<li>Hundreds of IU degree programs at risk of disappearing – WFIU/WTIU News</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Indiana University could lose hundreds of degree programs as part of compliance with an array of new laws affecting higher education that passed at the 11th hour of the legislative session. One of the laws requires public colleges and universities to eliminate programs with low numbers of degrees averaged over a three-year period. The cutoff is 15 graduates for a bachelor’s degree, seven for a master’s and three for a doctorate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>So far, most faculty don’t know what to expect. President-elect of the Bloomington Faculty Council Heather Akou said she hasn’t heard anything from the university but that it’s “aggressively” moving to get in line with the law. “There are going to be big changes for this university, and the pace at which this is being pushed through is not designed for positive outcomes,” she said. “I have to say that my faculty colleagues are in panic to a degree that I have never seen before.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Most of the degrees with low numbers of recipients are in the humanities and languages. Jewish Studies, Classical Studies and multiple language departments could lose their main offerings. From 2020 to 2022, IU Bloomington conferred more humanities doctorates than any other university in the country, according to data from Carnegie Classifications. It also ranks first for number of languages taught, for now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Even tenured faculty are wondering, am I going to have a job in two months?” Akou said. “We’re scheduled to teach classes. Will I be allowed to teach the classes I’m scheduled to teach this fall? I don’t know. That’s really the level of chaos and confusion that’s going on right now.” The university declined an interview, but spokesperson Mark Bode wrote in an email that “IU is working with campus leaders to comply with the process mandated by state law.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In a letter to University of California President Michael Drake dated Thursday, the Justice Department claimed a strategic growth plan created by the UC system that mentions diversity in hiring suggests that the educational institution “may be engaged” in discriminatory employment practices based on race or sex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(May be the only people who take a strategic plan so seriously; ours is here <a href="https://www.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/about/chancellor/strategic-roadmap/CUNY_Lifting_New_York.pdf">https://www.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/about/chancellor/strategic-roadmap/CUNY_Lifting_New_York.pdf</a> )</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The antisemitism probe at the UC system is supposed to determine whether a “hostile work environment” has existed for Jewish employees on its campuses. The investigation announced Monday, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, will similarly seek to determine whether discrimination has existed in UC hiring.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It is important to note that we have not reached any conclusions about the subject matter of the investigation. We intend to consider all relevant information,” Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said in her letter to Drake.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Dhillon’s letter did not detail specific allegations of instances of hiring discrimination. She cited the University of California 2030 Capacity Plan as having “precipitated unlawful action,” specifically employment practices that may have discriminated against “employees, job applicants and training program participants based on race and sex.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In its strategic plan, the University of California says it is “committed to increasing the diversity of its faculty, both underrepresented minorities and female faculty.” The plan discusses efforts to diversify the faculty so that campuses better reflect the population of California, a goal partially rooted in helping populations who are less likely to graduate from college earn degrees.</p>
