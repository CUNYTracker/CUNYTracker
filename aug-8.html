<h1>Aug 8</h1>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.</p>
<p>Thanks for VAC, JC for flagging important items this week.</p>
<p>A couple of important executive orders related to higher education are introduced this week. While not law, these give cover for an administration to use all the levers it controls to gain compliance. These are related to reporting of admissions data and oversight of federal grantmaking, which is sure to change the already tipped over playing board for grants.</p>

<p>More than 150 City University of New York faculty and staff rallied at Brooklyn College Thursday to demand the reinstatement of four faculty members in what the union says was due to their public advocacy for Palestinian rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“CUNY administrators have investigated faculty for the terms in which they discuss the war in Gaza in their classes, limited the time, place and manner for exercising the right to free expression on campus, invited police violence against non-violent student protestors, and even fired faculty in apparent retribution for their political activism,” James Davis, president of the Professional Staff Congress said in a statement. “Universities must stand against fascism, not accommodate it. Our fired colleagues have been denied due process and must be reinstated immediately.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Brooklyn College does not make personnel decisions based on political belief but based on conduct. As this is an ongoing personnel matter, we are unable to comment further,” a spokesperson for Brooklyn College said in a statement.</p>

<p>A federal judge in New York declined in a ruling on Friday to order the Trump administration to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in terminated funding that had been awarded to research institutions by the National Science Foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The ruling came in a lawsuit filed in May in which a coalition of 16 states argued that the grants were critical to maintaining the United States as a leader in science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, subjects, and that the cuts were “in complete derogation of the policies and priorities set by Congress.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“This evidence powerfully undermines plaintiffs’ argument that the priority directive renders this class of projects categorically ineligible for funding,” wrote Judge Cronan, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Trump in 2019 and confirmed the following year.</p>

<p>It was the fifth time that the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan legislative agency, faulted President Trump and his top aides for rearranging the budget in defiance of Congress. From February to June, investigators estimated, the N.I.H. awarded $8 billion less for research and other grants than it had a year earlier.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The findings underscored the real stakes in the growing clash between the Trump administration and Congress over the power of the purse.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The National Endowment for the Humanities abruptly canceled virtually all of its existing grants in April, citing a desire to pivot to “the president’s agenda.” Now it has announced its largest round of grants since, $34.8 million in funding for 97 projects across the country that helps show what that means.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The grants include many focused on presidents, statesmen and canonical authors, including $10 million to the University of Virginia — which the agency said was the largest grant in its history — that will support the “expedited completion” of editorial work on papers relating to the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolution and the Founding era.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>None of the new grants are explicitly related to L.G.B.T.Q. issues. And while there are several projects about prominent female figures, including Emily Dickinson and Marianne Moore, only one appears to take a broader look at gender and women’s history: a $700,000 grant to City Lore, a media company in New York, to support a documentary about female reporters during the Vietnam War.</p>

<p>To show they are serious about stamping out campus antisemitism, some of the nation’s top universities are adding a powerful position to their administrative ranks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The position has a modest sounding title: Title VI coordinator. The responsibilities, however, are significant: to oversee and ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in federally funded programs “on the ground of race, color or national origin” and also covers Jews, Arab Muslims and other religious groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But some legal experts warn that expanding Title VI oversight could lead universities into contentious thickets over defining antisemitic speech and adjudicating complaints of harassment. The end result, they say, could set new limits for permissible forms of expression, chilling speech on the quad and in the classroom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Historically, Title IX authorized the government to monitor whether educational institutions — not students — were engaged in discriminatory conduct.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But in a pivotal shift, the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights published new guidance for institutions in 2011. The office said that for institutions to remain in compliance with Title IX — and eligible for federal funds — they were required to thoroughly investigate and adjudicate sexual assault allegations with a disciplinary process and a standard of evidence that many critics said favored accusers. An institution’s investigative process, the guidance said, would be subject to federal review.</p>

<p>Paul G. Mahoney, a former dean of the law school at the University of Virginia, was named the institution’s interim president on Monday, after his predecessor as president resigned under intense pressure from the Trump administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr.&nbsp;Mahoney joined the law school faculty in 1990 after practicing law with the New York firm of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. He clerked for both Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, a staunch liberal, and for Judge Ralph K. Winter, Jr., an appellate judge who was regarded as a leading conservative.</p>

<li>NYTimes: Trump Went to War With the Ivies. Community Colleges Are Being Hit.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Since January, the Trump administration has waged war on the nation’s wealthiest and most prestigious universities, freezing billions of dollars in research grants to Harvard and blasting away at Columbia’s institutional autonomy. But collateral damage from these attacks has engulfed schools of all types, including the country’s 1,100 community colleges, which educate about 6.4 million undergraduates each year — roughly 40 percent of the national total and more than twice as many as are enrolled at every highly selective college and university in the country combined.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Like their four-year counterparts, community colleges are grappling with disappearing federal grants, shuttered D.E.I. offices, eliminated programs, canceled cultural convocations and panicked students and staff. At Delta, many of the grants that fund financial aid for low-income students and the staff that support them have been eliminated or threatened. I went to see the hydraulic-circuit class in part because of how much government funding, a great deal of it federal, it takes to make the teaching possible. It was hardly the only class I could have chosen: Federal funding helps pay not just for heavy machinery used in courses like the one taught by Luna but also, elsewhere on the Delta campus, for the full dental lab for aspiring hygienists; the X-ray machines surrounded by lead-lined walls for radiography students; and the robotic medical mannequins, one that pushed out little baby mannequins and could simulate everything from a breech birth to a health emergency.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I also came to Delta to meet its president, Mike Gavin, who in this moment of fear and uncertainty has emerged as a kind of spokesman for America’s community colleges as a whole. Gavin heads an improvised coalition of community-college presidents and administrators called Education for All, which, amid the responses to the federal government’s assaults, has been the rare example of collective action among higher-ed leadership.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Unlike elite universities, community colleges often can’t afford to keep an in-house counsel on payroll, let alone the teams of lawyers who have been advising Ivy League schools on their present predicament. So Education for All members, in addition to offering solidarity and support, provided advice on how their schools could navigate all the hurdles being thrown in front of them.</p>

<p>New international enrollments in the U.S. could drop by as many as 150,000 students in the next year, according to scenario modeling by NAFSA, the association of international educators, and JB International.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“This analysis … should serve as a clarion call to the State Department that it must act to ensure international students and scholars are able to arrive on U.S. campuses this fall,” said Fanta Aw, executive director and CEO of NAFSA, in a press release. “For the United States to succeed in the global economy, we must keep our doors open to students from around the world.”</p>

<li>Stanford Plans to Cut 363 Jobs</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Stanford president Jon Levin and provost Jenny Martinez noted in a letter to campus that the cuts were part of an effort announced last month to reduce $140 million in the general funds budget. They called the layoffs, reported Tuesday, “the product of a challenging fiscal environment shaped in large part by federal policy changes affecting higher education.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>University officials provided more information in a letter filed with the California Employment Development Department that accompanied the layoff notice. They cited “anticipated changes in federal policy—such as reductions in federal research funding and an increase in the excise tax on investment income” as significant factors driving the reduction of Stanford’s workforce.</p>

<li>How Trump Forced Cuts at Wealthy Universities</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While sector layoffs are so frequent that Inside Higher Ed has dedicated monthly coverage to rounding up such reductions, those actions are more common at small, cash-strapped colleges or state institutions reeling from budget cuts. But universities with multibillion-dollar endowments have been among those making the deepest cuts in the first half of 2025, often driven by freezes on federal funding that the Trump administration imposed with minimal notice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Altogether the layoffs show a sector bracing for a new reality where research funding can be suddenly yanked away with little to no explanation and international and graduate student enrollment, once considered a cash cow, is under threat—prompting institutions in even the highest financial stratosphere to cut costs as they navigate changing policies and a president sharply critical of the sector.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Upon his return to office in 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14,203 (the “2025 Order”), which is substantially similar to the Order that Judge Failla enjoined over four years ago; in fact, it includes the exact language that she found likely unconstitutional.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On the merits, the Court concludes that the 2025 Order violates Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights because it constitutes a content-based regulation of their speech-based activities and cannot survive strict scrutiny. Accordingly, and for the reasons elaborated below, Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED, and they are entitled to a permanent injunction.</p>
