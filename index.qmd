# CUNY Tracker

An unofficial, curated, partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific. Each written as weekly digests sent to CUNY UFS Senators and FGLs.


If you have stories/reports you would like me to include in anticipated future digests, please send along via an email to me directly (john.verzani@csi.cuny.edu).
