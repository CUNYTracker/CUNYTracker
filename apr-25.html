<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The pretexts that the administration is using have to do with D.E.I. and antisemitism. The real reasons, I think, are anti-intellectualism and greed, and the fact that Trump is building a mafia state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now, a mafia state is an absolutely centralized system in which one person, the patron, the don, distributes money and power. And so in order to build a mafia state, such an aspiring patron needs to strip other agents of their money and power.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And it has the ability to, if not bankrupt universities — it certainly has the ability to bankrupt universities that don’t have significant endowments, which is most of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The only way for universities to really address this is to come to terms with the fact that there is no way for them, with this administration, to keep their federal money.</p>

<p>we have witnessed what one scholar correctly called an “unusually brazen series of challenges to academic freedom,” unleashed by conservative activists and a “national-level political machine” … to undermine academic freedom and university autonomy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Including academic gag orders seeking to ban the teaching of “critical race theory” (CRT); shuttering academic programs; dismantling institutional efforts to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion; weaken tenure protections for faculty; undermined the accreditation process; establish academic programs, centers, and whole schools designed to teach conservative content;</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As this white paper demonstrates, however, this legislation is largely the outgrowth of efforts by right-wing and libertarian think tanks, working closely with Republican politicians, to manufacture a culture-war backlash against educators and academic institutions … as part of a well-organized and well-funded backlash that seeks to roll back the political, social, and cultural gains made in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement increased queer and trans visibility.</p>

<p>Federal judges in New Hampshire and Maryland handed down the rulings after finding plaintiffs in the two separate lawsuits were likely to succeed in proving that the Feb.&nbsp;14 Dear Colleague letter violated procedural standards and the First Amendment.

<p>“Although the 2025 letter does not make clear what exactly it prohibits, it makes at least one thing clear: schools should not come close to anything that could be considered ‘DEI,’ lest they be deemed to have guessed wrong,” the New Hampshire judge wrote. And since loss of federal grants could cripple institutions, “it is predictable—if not obvious—that [they] will eliminate all vestiges of DEI to avoid even the possibility of funding termination,” regardless of whether it is an example of executive overreach.</p>

<p>“I believe that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency and feel that it is time to pass the baton to new leadership,” Panchanathan wrote in a resignation letter, first reported by Science. “I am deeply grateful to the presidents for the opportunity to serve our nation.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Earlier this month, the Florida DOGE asked public college and university presidents to provide an account—by the end of last week—of “all research published by staff” over the last six years, including “Papers and drafts made available to the public or in online academic repositories for drafts, preprints, or similar materials.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“If not contained therein, author’s name, title, and position at the institution” must be provided, according to the letters the presidents received. The letters didn’t say what this and other requests were for.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Florida DOGE also requested information on all grants awarded to institutions over the last six years, asking for each institution’s policy on allocating grants “for purposes of indirect cost recovery, including procedures for calculation.” Further, it requested an account of “all filled and vacant positions held by any employee with a non-instructional role.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By the end of April, Florida’s public institutions must also provide the “Length of research associated” with each research publication, funding sources associated with the research and any “publications about the research” from the researcher or institution. In addition, the state DOGE is requesting funding sources for each institution’s noninstructional positions and the names of the nonstudent employees administering the grants.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>President Donald Trump has launched a public blitzkrieg against Harvard. On Monday, he froze $2.2 billion in federal funding after the university rejected a far-reaching list of contradictory demands, including the hiring of an external auditor to evaluate the “viewpoint diversity” of its students, faculty, staff and leadership. On Wednesday, Treasury asked the IRS to consider revoking Harvard’s tax-exempt status. (Donations to the university could dry up if they’re not tax-deductible.) Next, the Department of Homeland Security threatened to revoke Harvard’s ability to host international students, who make up 27 percent of the student body. In the coming months, Trump and congressional allies hope to impose devastating taxes on university endowment funds — Vice President Vance has suggested as high as 35 percent — and plan to scrutinize their investments in China and clean energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Academic freedom is worth defending. In the long term, this might require colleges to reduce their dependence on federal dollars. In the short term, schools should stick together to resist Trump’s unlawful dictates on what they teach and whom they hire. It is heartening that Harvard’s defiance is already helping to stiffen the backbones of college administrators elsewhere.</p>

<p>The cost of Trump’s proposals could exceed $100 million per year for dozens of institutions, according to analysis by the economist Phillip Levine. And yet the Trump administration has gone even further by withholding nearly all federal grant funding from some elite institutions. Columbia University tried to preserve $400 million in federal funding by agreeing to a list of onerous federal demands that get into the minutiae of academic governance, but even that has not satisfied the federal government.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Blue-state public flagship universities are likely the next target, and even institutions that avoid such politicized attention are likely to suffer from structural cuts in federal grants and contracts. These cuts have happened so suddenly that some universities began to take action immediately in order to preserve cash flow, a key lesson from the pandemic. But this is also a longer-term financial issue as 45 months remain in the Trump administration, and there is no guarantee that federal funding returns to normal in 2029.</p>
