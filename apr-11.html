<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>However, the Trump administration is weaponizing these legitimate investigations as a pretext for an unprecedented federal attack on higher education. The administration’s recent actions—including its letter to Columbia University’s Board of Trustees and its illegal detention and threatened deportation of a student green card holder who has not been charged with a crime—go far beyond enforcing civil rights law. These measures threaten free speech, due process, and the very foundations of inquiry and unrestricted exploration of ideas on which academic institutions are built.</p>

<li>Ohio Budget Bill Could Enact Even More Higher Ed Changes</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The latest version of an Ohio state budget bill includes numerous provisions that could impact public colleges and universities—including a line saying that, in curricular decisions, all feedback by a faculty senate, “or comparable representative body, is <strong>advisory</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>House Bill 96 stresses that institutions’ boards of trustees would have the “final, overriding authority to approve or reject any establishment or modification” of any “courses, general education requirements, and degree programs.” It also stresses that boards would have “unilateral and ultimate authority to establish new academic programs, schools, colleges, institutes, departments, and centers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Sara Kilpatrick, executive director of the Ohio Conference of the American Association of University Professors, said it’s already “ultimately under the boards’ responsibilities to have the final say in really anything.” But, she said, “I think that this is specifically language that’s designed to sideline faculty and to potentially politicize program and curriculum offerings.”</p>

<p>A longer piece on the history of the DOE and education in US history</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>America’s story is one of progress, which has rarely been obtained simply through good will. It has to be enforced. Fights for equality have been messy, and quite bloody at times. Understanding that history is important so as not to repeat it. Still, shortly before leaving office in 2020, Mr.&nbsp;Trump established the President’s Advisory 1776 Commission, in part a rebuttal to the 1619 Project, as a way for the administration to write its own version of American history.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The president’s vision to take a sledgehammer to the Department of Education’s ability to function will cause student suffering. The founders believed that education was critical to the full experience of citizenship; it was where students learned arts, sciences, humanities and how to engage with one another. But putting that vision into place left the nation with a system where inequities — in content and classroom composition — were left in place.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>America began to undo those inequities, and the department protected that progress. Now, less than three months into Mr.&nbsp;Trump’s second presidency, the administration has done everything in its power, and some things beyond its authority, to ensure we are equal no more.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://wapo.st/43EUxWX">https://wapo.st/43EUxWX</a></p>
<p>This is an important analysis of the playbook being employed and it references what appears to be another Chris Rufo type.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Critical of college admissions, diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and campus protests that he lambasted as pro-Hamas, Max Eden, then a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote an outline that presaged what was to come in the new Trump administration. He singled out Columbia as the top target.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p> “To scare universities straight,” Eden wrote in the Washington Examiner [https://www.aei.org/op-eds/a-comprehensive-guide-to-overhauling-higher-education/] , Education Secretary Linda McMahon “should start by taking a prize scalp. She should simply destroy Columbia University.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On the day the administration canceled the federal funding to the school, a senior Trump administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, described Columbia as a “test case” for using funding to pressure colleges to comply with Trump’s ideology.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“We’re going to bankrupt these universities,” Leo Terrell, leader of the recently formed Justice Department task force on antisemitism, said on Fox News after the cuts to Columbia were announced.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“They are targeting private institutions of education and attempting to police and control speech, political expression and thought. And that is truly unprecedented,” said Orion Danjuma, counsel at Protect Democracy, which is representing the unions alongside the law firm Altshuler Berzon. “Columbia is the testing ground for this. It’s a canary in the coal mine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Other changes are not an exact match to the administration’s demands. The university is not abolishing its judicial board that oversees disciplinary cases as requested. But it will remove students from participating and give the provost oversight. It is not putting the Middle East, South Asian and African Studies department in academic receivership for five years as the administration wanted. That academic department will undergo a review by the provost’s office.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“This was planned,” said Reinhold Martin, president of Columbia’s chapter of the AAUP. “We’ve seen the script. The assault on Columbia is going according to that script.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the Eden piece here are his talking points:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Cutting Off Federal Funding</strong> – Columbia was, perhaps, the worst offender in indulging the pro-Hamas campus radicals. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights should initiate a compliance review of every single decision Columbia made. To do that, OCR would need the identities of every single foreign student who supported the protests, actions the Trump administration could deem material support of a terrorist organization. Border czar Tom Homan could then revoke every single one of the foreign protesting students’ visas. If Columbia doesn’t cooperate, McMahon could cut off its research grant funding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Removing Foreign Money from Higher Education</strong> – And while the Trump administration is looking into Columbia, the Justice Department should thoroughly explore indicting former Columbia President Lee Bollinger for fraud if he, through commission or omission, played a role in Columbia’s submission of inaccurate data to US News and World Report. Bollinger submitted the data to boost Columbia’s rank in the report. Once the true data were reported, Columbia’s rank fell from second to 18th. College presidents regard Bollinger as perhaps the greatest college leader of the 21st century. He should be regarded as the worst. Perhaps the college presidents could learn a valuable lesson from the sight of him in an orange jumpsuit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The second target should be the University of California, Los Angeles. UCLA’s …</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Enforcing Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard</strong>; he first step should be forcing Harvard University to comply. Right after the decision was issued, Harvard all but publicly vowed to do everything in its power to violate the spirit of the Supreme Court’s ruling and the 14th Amendment on which it was based. McMahon should initiate a never-ending compliance review to ensure that Harvard follows the law. … If OCR finds a shred of evidence of racial discrimination, Harvard should lose its Title IV funds. I</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And so many other universities have essentially forfeited the privilege of picking their own professors.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The University of Washington and UIC should be forced to pay back wages to every single white applicant they declined to hire over a DEI statement and hire as many as would still like to work there. … However, it could demand all documents and correspondence on hiring in every university faculty department that implemented DEI statements. It could then train an artificial intelligence model to sort through the records and flag likely discrimination. Trump staffers could then send internal, FOIA-able correspondence regarding hot spots of likely discrimination. … Enterprising trial attorneys could team up with starving adjunct professors, and universities could be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement fees. That would teach them a painful lesson: Hiring based on race rather than academic merit comes at a very high cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>How Trump can Destroy DEI on Campus</strong> – it’s all stereotyping. DEI violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment when stereotyping is institutionalized and promoted in an educational institution receiving federal funding — or so the Trump administration should hold and enforce. … To assure compliance with the 14th Amendment, McMahon could task accreditors with ensuring that students aren’t forced to take DEI-infused courses to graduate. This would, essentially, take Florida’s policy of removing DEI from general education requirements national. When students aren’t forced to take these courses, far fewer will, and the radical Marxists will lose students and influence. … McMahon could also champion college students’ First Amendment rights by forcing colleges to dismantle their so-called “Bias Reporting Systems.” More than half of colleges encourage students to snitch on each other for saying something “biased,” and students suspected of wrong speak are then hauled in front of a campus tribunal of DEI administrators.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Shaking Up College Accreditation</strong> – Trump suggested he would simply fire all the existing accreditors. That could prove prohibitively difficult. But Trump could easily decimate the worst of them: the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. … Trump could also easily expedite the approval of additional accreditors. These accreditors could provide a much more streamlined, cost-effective, outcomes-oriented paradigm than the existing set. They could also specialize in helping to launch new colleges, such as the University of Austin, and even newer ones that no one has dreamed up yet. Musk University? Thiel Technical College?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>A New Kind of Public College</strong> What about the American Academy? Experts laughed when Trump proposed launching a new, federally backed college. But former President George Washington wanted one. … At absolute minimum, the American Academy could offer a two-year, high-quality core curriculum, and sympathetic states could mandate their flagship universities accept transfer credit. The Universities of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the like could hoover up students who might otherwise have spent far bigger bucks on a private university with a similar prestige level.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>These are just some ideas, and they’re just mine. And, of course, there’s far more the next Trump Education Department should and can do — it just wouldn’t be prudent to broadcast those ideas ahead of time, lest universities take defensive measures.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A consent decree would be a major escalation of how the federal government normally resolves education-related civil-rights issues. Typically after federal lawyers investigate and find evidence that civil rights were violated, schools enter voluntary agreements to change their practices. The federal government has little ability to enforce such agreements. The Biden administration entered into such voluntary agreements over antisemitism concerns with Brown University and Rutgers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Columbia could fight the move in court; the Justice Department would need to prove that the arrangement is warranted. But a court case could take years, and Columbia would likely lose federal funding in the interim—and might ultimately lose. Opposing the move would also open the school up to required depositions and legal fact-finding, which could keep the school’s campus politics in the spotlight.</p>

<p>In 2020, students, alumni, and law professors tried — unsuccessfully — to get Jacobson fired for a series of blog posts they perceived as creating a hostile learning environment for Black students.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Jacobson manages four websites, publishes a weekly podcast, has written op-eds in The New York Times, and has been featured on Fox News more than 10 times. He has mobilized dozens of professors from across the country to track on his website criticalrace.org hundreds of social-justice statements, staff diversity trainings, and courses he says indoctrinate students with false ideas about American racism. His site has been cited more than 170 times by mainstream-media outlets.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Legal Insurrection Foundation, Jacobson’s nonprofit, collected $1.2 million in revenue from donations and grants in 2023, according to tax filings. It’s not clear who has donated to his cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This past December, Jacobson filed a complaint to OCR against the University of Rhode Island for offering more than 31 scholarships exclusively given to minority students. Mentioned in the complaint was the Miya Brophy-Baermann scholarship, which provides $1,500 to speech-language-pathology students who are racial minorities, men, or the first in their families to attend college.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Many young researchers say they are having to choose between staying in the United States and staying in science. America shouldn’t take scientific progress in medicine, artificial intelligence, energy and more for granted. If the youngest, brightest minds aren’t soon reassured that the United States can support their work — and that scientific inquiry will be protected from political interference — they will walk away.</p>

<li>NYTimes: Trump Is Selling Jews a Dangerous Lie</li>

<p>(Wesleyan President speaks out, again)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>With an administration seemingly determined to do everything, everywhere, all at once, discerning its true priorities can sometimes be challenging. But on this one point, Donald Trump wants no ambiguity: “My promise to Jewish Americans is this,” he said on the campaign trail. “With your vote, I will be your defender, your protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As the first Jewish president of a formerly Methodist university, I find no comfort in the Trump administration’s embrace of my people, on college campuses or elsewhere. Jew hatred is real, but today’s anti-antisemitism isn’t a legitimate effort to fight it. It’s a cover for a wide range of agendas that have nothing to do with the welfare of Jewish people.</p>

<p>Pidluzny (DOE deputy chief of staff for policy and programs) took aim at accreditors as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Our accountability systems are also badly broken. It’s almost impossible to start a new university today largely because of our accreditation system. And universities that underperform are allowed to go on underperforming with few consequences,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>(Speculation is rife that an executive order reshaping accreditation will be issued this month.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>First, he argued for the need to reorient the enforcement of civil rights on campus, which he said the department has begun to do by holding universities accountable for harassment, discrimination and specifically antisemitism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Pidluzny also said that ED must “reorient federal investments away from ideology, back to the advancement of learning and teaching excellence”</p>

<p>Any Washington Post link with a shortened url is a gift article; but there are only so many a month to gift.</p>
<p>I tried to use <a href="https://12ft.io">https://12ft.io</a> to create links, but that is not very reliable. Ditto with the wayback machine at <a href="https://web.archive.org">https://web.archive.org</a>.</p>
