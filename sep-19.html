<h1>Sep 19</h1>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.</p>
<p>(Thanks to K, VAC for sharing stories this week.)</p>
<p>The aftermath of a murder has reached farther faster than could have been imagined. This week the Freedom of expression category is far to full of items.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As a Jewish teacher and university president, it pains me to see the fight against antisemitism used as a cudgel with which to attack centers of teaching and research. I’ve been very aware of antisemitism since I was a little boy,…I am genuinely startled, though, by the ways Christian nationalists in the American government use Jew hatred as a vehicle to advance their authoritarian agenda. That’s what we are witnessing today: the exploitation of anti-antisemitism by a White House determined to extort money and expressions of loyalty from higher education.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This environment is threatened by the enormous pressure the federal government is putting on higher education to “align its priorities” with those of the president. I am worried about the normalization of this authoritarian effort to reshape the ecosystem of higher education. Too many opportunists and collaborators have been responding by noisily preaching neutrality or just keeping their heads down.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Some faculty, student and alumni groups, however, have begun to stand up and make their voices heard. Whether refusing to apologize for diversity efforts or simply standing up for the freedom of scientific inquiry, there is growing resistance to the administration’s attempt to control civil society in general and higher education in particular.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We don’t want the government thinking for us, telling us what the president’s priorities are so that we can imitate them. We want to learn to think for ourselves in the company of others, leaving behind a dependence on authority. Authoritarians would see us impose immaturity upon ourselves. As the new school year begins, we in higher education must redouble our efforts to model and defend the enlightenment ideals of education and freedom—while we still can.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Late Wednesday, a student affairs administrator at Middle Tennessee State University was fired after posting “insensitive” remarks on Facebook in response to Kirk’s death.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Looks like ol’ Charlie spoke his fate into existence. Hate begets hate. ZERO sympathy,” Sosh-Lightsy wrote in a Facebook post … Tennessee senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, called for Sosh-Lightsy’s firing on X,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On Thursday afternoon, University of Mississippi chancellor Glenn Boyce confirmed the firing of an unnamed staff member who he said “re-shared hurtful, insensitive comments on social media regarding the tragic murder of Charlie Kirk.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>At Baylor University, officials distanced the university from a graduate student who wrote “this made me giggle” in response to a social media post sharing the news of Kirk’s death.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression is monitoring which universities are censoring employee speech, said Lindsie Rank, director of campus rights advocacy at FIRE. “It may not be moral to speak ill of the dead, but it is protected by the First Amendment so we’re going to be keeping our eyes open for those situations,” she said.</p>

<p>Republican politicians and other conservatives are calling for employees, including those in higher ed, to be terminated for their social media posts about Kirk’s killing.</p>

<p>and at least one Trump administration official have actively encouraged people to scour the internet for remarks celebrating the killing and to expose those who have posted them online.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, issued a separate call on Thursday morning, asking his more than 200,000 followers on X to reach out to him with information about “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A Secret Service employee was placed on administrative leave after stating on Facebook that Mr.&nbsp;Kirk had “spewed hate and racism on his show,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>After Michael Mann, a prominent climate scientist who works at the University of Pennsylvania, reposted a message referring to Mr.&nbsp;Kirk as the “head of Trump’s Hitler Youth,” Dave McCormick, the state’s Republican senator, called it “despicable” and urged the university to “take immediate, decisive action.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Rose Pugliese, a Colorado state lawmaker who is a Republican, asked Gov.&nbsp;Jared Polis, a Democrat, on Thursday to fire a state employee who had accused Mr.&nbsp;Kirk online of being “a white man who spews horrid” words “against every marginalized community.”</p>

<p>The force and scale of the doxing campaigns—and the speed with which institutions have moved to suspend or terminate their targets—paints a grim picture of free speech rights on public college campuses. Widespread doxing as a political tool to punish universities and academics is not a new phenomenon, but right now it’s particularly virulent, explained Keith Whittington, a professor at Yale Law School and an expert on free speech. “The size of the activity, the pressure campaign and the … short period of time is highly unusual,” he said. “Universities feel like they’re under intense pressure to mollify right-wing activists and try not to draw negative attention from the [Trump] administration.”</p>

<p>A Texas State University professor was fired days after he made remarks the institution’s president described as advocating for “inciting violence,” becoming the second faculty member in the state this week to be swiftly terminated following the release of a viral video.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But experts say there’s an important distinction between the two cases: The Texas State faculty member was an associate professor with tenure, which typically grants several layers of due process before termination, while a Texas A&amp;M senior lecturer who was terminated earlier this week didn’t have the same protections.

<p>The speed of Alter’s termination was legally dubious, higher-ed legal experts told The Chronicle, and violated the principles of academic freedom.

<p>This was already a theme before Kirk’s murder. Texas A&amp;M University fired a lecturer seemingly at the behest of the governor after politicians objected to the content of her children’s-literature class. Texas State University fired a history professor for his personal advocacy of the organization of a revolutionary socialist party that would aid the working class to “overthrow” the United States government.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But the pressure to patrol speech on college campuses has since reached new intensity. An assistant dean in the Office of Student Care and Conduct at Middle Tennessee State University was fired for a “callous and insensitive” social-media post after Kirk’s death. An English professor at Cumberland University was fired after a U.S. senator called attention to his posts about “a Nazi getting shot.” An art professor at the University of South Dakota was fired after calling Kirk a “hate-spreading Nazi” after his murder. A College of the Sequoias biology professor is under investigation for allegedly telling his class that he hoped Kirk’s whole family would meet the same fate. A Guilford Technical Community College English instructor was fired for praising the assassin to her class. An audio-technology professor at Clemson University has been suspended for mocking Kirk’s death in social-media posts.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Public colleges are legally constrained by the First Amendment in how they can respond to demands to punish students and employees for hateful, morally depraved, or politically incendiary speech. Private colleges have more flexibility, though many have voluntarily tied themselves to First Amendment norms through their own policies. Everyone on campus, including senior university officials, should understand what speech is — and is not — protected under such rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Given the misinformation about First Amendment rules routinely spread in public discourse — including by university officials — it is worth clarifying that in the United States, constitutional protections for speech are expansive, a fact not always reflected in the official statements from colleges. Texas State University suggested that speech that “advocates for inciting violence” is unprotected. Clemson claimed that the right to free speech does not extend to expression that “incites harm or undermines the dignity of others.” The chairman of the board at Southern University implied that “distasteful statements” about death are “tantamount to participating and inciting violence and spewing hate,” and thus unprotected. None of this is really true.</p>

<p>The National Institutes of Health now appears on track to spend its full $47 billion budget by Sept.&nbsp;30, the end of the federal fiscal year, STAT News reported Friday. That reflects “a frenzy of grantmaking activity during August,” worth more than $8 billion, STAT noted; the agency was far behind on awarding grants going into the summer, due to delays in the grant review process, the fight over the cap on indirect cost rates and widespread layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>However, STAT’s analysis showed that while the value of the grants awarded is roughly the same, the NIH is funding many fewer new projects this year than in the past. That’s because earlier this year the White House Office of Management and Budget mandated a shift in the way the agency distributes research dollars to a multiyear model, meaning that at least half of all new projects will be funded up front for multiple years rather than receive a new tranche of funding each year.</p>

<p>(Damning story showing the effects of political malfeasance at the NIH)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When America declared war on cancer more than 50 years ago, there was a misguided assumption outside the scientific community that it would be only a matter of years before the disease was eradicated — that defeating cancer would be no different than building an atomic bomb or putting a man on the moon. But there would be no miracle cure: As of this writing, some 40 percent of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>According to a recent study in The Journal of Clinical Oncology, every $326 that our government spends researching cancer extends a human life by one year. Now an extraordinarily successful scientific research system — one that took decades to build, has saved millions of lives and generated billions of dollars in profits for American companies and investors — is being dismantled before our eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In a matter of months, the Trump administration has canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in cancer-related research grants and contracts, arguing that they were part of politically driven D.E.I. initiatives, and suspended or delayed payments for hundreds of millions more. It is trying to sharply reduce the percentage of expenses that the government will cover for federally funded cancer-research labs. It has terminated hundreds of government employees who helped lead the country’s cancer-research system and ensured that new discoveries reached clinicians, cancer patients and the American public. And the president’s proposed budget for the next fiscal year calls for a more-than-37-percent cut to the National Cancer Institute — the N.I.H. agency that leads most of the nation’s cancer research — reducing it to $4.5 billion from $7.2 billion. Adjusting for inflation, you have to go back more than 30 years to find a comparably sized federal cancer-research budget.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the absence of any such plan [neither he nor anyone inside his administration has spoken explicitly about its intention to radically rethink how America funds and directs cancer research], it’s hard not to see the ongoing dismantling of the cancer research system as collateral damage in a larger, partisan war against both the predominantly Democratic scientific establishment and the predominantly Democratic academic institutions where much of the country’s biomedical research takes place. And yet the term “collateral damage” suggests a lack of agency; this has been a deliberate and targeted attack. “They have studied how N.I.H. works, studied it hard and learned it well,” says Sarah Kobrin, head of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch at the National Cancer Institute. “And they have put sand in the gears in ways that are very effective, devastating.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Supporters of the proposal said it would effectively create a state version of the National Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation, two of the nation’s largest institutional funders of scientific and public health research. The move follows California, Washington and Oregon’s announcement that they would form a health alliance to review scientific data and make vaccine recommendations for their residents, in an attempt to bypass vaccine skeptics in the Trump administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The plan to back scientific research calls for lawmakers to pass, and for voters to approve in a 2026 ballot measure, a proposed $23 billion in bonds, financing that will allow the state to make grants and loans to universities, research companies and health care organizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It would be the largest state effort of its kind, and is considerably more aggressive than one floated in Massachusetts in July, when Gov.&nbsp;Maura Healey made a $400 million proposal for research there.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>University of California leaders, besieged by a billion-dollar demand from the Trump administration, will meet Wednesday as they weigh how to confront Washington’s campaign to remake American campuses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The consequences of that effort have become increasingly vivid inside the university, which has been contending with an uproar over its decision last month to comply with federal investigators’ request for information. The university gave the Department of Education the names of scores of students and employees connected to allegations of antisemitism, a move that infuriated people throughout the 10-campus system after word of it emerged this month.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The disclosure deepened the sense of turmoil inside U.C., which is facing an escalating effort from the Trump administration to force changes to one of the nation’s largest and most distinguished university systems. The full Board of Regents has not met in public since mid-July, and the Trump administration’s tactics have gathered far greater force since then.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For example, the government demanded last month that the university pay about $1.2 billion to settle accusations of antisemitism at its Los Angeles campus, and it has pressured administrators there to accept conditions that include steps to ensure “that foreign students likely to engage in anti-Western, anti-American or antisemitic disruptions or harassment are not recruited or admitted.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Ahead of Wednesday’s regents’ meeting in San Francisco, Mr.&nbsp;Milliken acknowledged in a statement that threats to the system could metastasize and warned that the federal authorities were “pursuing investigations and actions in various stages against all 10 U.C. campuses.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In a statement on Tuesday, the system’s general counsel, Charles F. Robinson, argued that the university had only followed its regular practice of responding to “information requests arising from audits, compliance reviews and investigations.” Mr.&nbsp;Robinson said the university had also made sure to comply with “applicable privacy laws.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“U.C. will continue to meet its legal obligations,” he added, “while exploring all legal avenues to safeguard the privacy and trust of our community members.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But the litigation from the workers’ groups nevertheless underscored the measured approach that U.C. has adopted so far. Some inside the university are wary of taking steps that could further rile the Trump administration, which has repeatedly cut federal funding to universities to try to bring them to heel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Like other major American universities, U.C. relies on vast sums of federal funding to operate. More than $7 billion goes to research and federal student aid, Mr.&nbsp;Milliken noted this week, while roughly $10 billion more flows from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. (U.C. has six academic medical centers.)</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The complaint was filed Tuesday in federal district court by the American Association of University Professors, Democracy Forward, and numerous other labor unions and organizations that represent tens of thousands of faculty members, students and staff members across the large public university system.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The lawsuit details numerous demands, also reported Monday by the Los Angeles Times, made by the Trump administration of UCLA. They include eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs; ceding control over university admissions, hiring and curriculum to an outside monitor; reporting student disciplinary records; and other measures.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Trump administration has sought to exert ideological control over higher education, the lawsuit contends, “through a scheme of targeting, bullying and unconstitutional actions aimed at institutions of higher education across the country.”</p>

<p>Colleges and universities have been under pressure by Kirk and his political allies for years. Turning Point USA launched its Professor Watchlist in 2016 to intimidate professors whom the organizations claims “discriminate against conservative students, promote anti-American values, and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.” (Full disclosure: I am on the Professor Watchlist myself, apparently on the basis of my scholarship on the conservative movement and the far right and teaching a class on fascism and antifascism.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But TPUSA’s attacks on academic freedom have paled in comparison to the Trump administration’s assaults on higher education through funding freezes for basic scientific research, legal attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and the targeting of dozens of universities by the Department of Justice for transparently political reasons. At the University of Virginia, my home institution, DOJ pressure was instrumental in prompting the resignation of the university’s president, Jim Ryan, at the end of June.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It is practically inevitable that there will be dire policy consequences from Kirk’s assassination, regardless of the actual ideology of his killer, because his death fits a pre-existing narrative about left-wing campus radicalism that is already the driver of federal policy. We can expect to see an intensification of the Trump administration’s political and legal battles with universities, even tighter scrutiny for faculty and staff (particularly those teaching controversial or sensitive subjects), and the continued erosion of academic freedom on campuses targeted by the administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There is also the very real threat of further violence. Scores of prominent MAGA influencers reacted to Kirk’s death by calling for violence against their political enemies. Chaya Raichik, who runs the infamous LibsOfTikTok X account, which before Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover was suspended multiple times for inciting death threats, declared that “THIS IS WAR.” Musk, for his part, wrote that “The Left is the party of murder.” There have already been consequences: On Thursday, at least five HBCUs in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Virginia locked down their campuses due to terroristic threats.</p>

<p>And for me, the frame of reference is the campaign to desegregate universities in the 1960s, the early 1960s. And your listeners may recall that in fact, the president of the United States, President Kennedy, actually sent in armed … sent in the 101st Airborne troops to forcibly desegregate universities. I think he established an important precedent and I think the president to this day still retains all remedies up to and including parachuting in the 101st Airborne if these universities continue to discriminate on the basis of race, scapegoat students on the basis of race, and segregate students on basis of race.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But the principle is still the same. Discrimination is discrimination, segregation is segregation, scapegoating is scapegoating. And the precedent is still the same. The president under Article II of the Constitution retains the power to enforce the law, to make sure that universities are adhering with the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act. And I’m not saying that the president should send in the 101st Airborne. I’m merely saying that he retains the right to do so under the Constitution and longstanding precedent.</p>
