Now the responsibility of posting these grant opportunities is poised to rest with DOGE — and if its employees delay those postings or stop them altogether, “it could effectively shut down federal-grant making,” said one federal official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal operations.\n\n\nTrump administration to pull Maine K-12 funding over trans athletes dispute\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/11/maine-education-trump-janet-mills/\nNot higher ed related, but shows the willingness to break everything:\n\nThe move prompted a swift response from the Trump administration’s Department of Education, which promptly said it would cut all federal K-12 funding to Maine and refer its investigation into the state’s education agency to the Justice Department “for further enforcement action.”\n\n\nEnergy Department reduces funding for grants to colleges and universities\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/12/trump-cuts-department-of-energy/\n(Same story, cut overhead…)\n\nNYTimes: What Is Actually the Point of Treating the N.I.H.

They will hamper the investments these colleges make in the leaders of our next generation. Advances in medicine, science, and technology will slow. The negative effect on economic activity will be substantial. And the economic opportunity that these institutions offer to lower-income students will be limited.

He can’t do it without this industry he hates.\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4jm94vB\n\nPresident Donald Trump says he wants to reduce our trade deficit. Yet he’s destroying one of our winningest exports: higher education.\n\n\nColleges and universities are among America’s most competitive international exporters.

It would consolidate NIH’s 27 institutes and centers into just eight. Some of its institutes and centers would be eliminated, including the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities and the National Institute of Nursing Research.\n\n\nThe proposal would cut the CDC’s budget by about 44 percent, from $9.2 billion to about $5.2 billion, and would eliminate all of the agency’s chronic disease programs and domestic HIV work. The chronic disease programs being eliminated include work on heart disease, obesity, diabetes and smoking cessation.\n\n\nWhat to Know About Trump’s Funding Threats to Colleges\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/18/what-know-about-trumps-funding-threats-colleges\n\nThe cuts don’t follow any typical investigative process and sometimes lack clear explanations or legal justifications. And such an aggressive ad hoc strategy is one that that many higher education lawyers, policy analysts and administrators say could reshape postsecondary education for years to come.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome foreign students fear speaking out as visa cancellations rise\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/12/international-students-visas-revoke-fear/\nA rush to delete social media…\n\nNYTimes: A Columbia Activist Sought Middle Ground on Gaza.

In the rare areas where the president — or perhaps Elon Musk — may see value in research, the emergent mafia state is almost certain to distribute funds to its friends. One shudders to think what universities would have to do to fit themselves into that category.\n\n\nSo this is my radical proposal for universities: Act like universities, not like businesses. Spend your endowments. Accept more, not fewer students. Open up your campuses and expand your reach not by buying real estate but by bringing education to communities. Create a base. Become a movement.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Threats Force Institutions to Choose: Cut a Deal or Fight Back\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-universities-law-firms-deals.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAt Harvard, hundreds, including Mr. Bowie, rallied to call on the school to stand up to the Trump administration’s demands, while hundreds of faculty members signed a letter urging Harvard to condemn Mr. Trump’s attempt to remake higher education.\n\n\nAt Yale, nearly 1,000 faculty members signed a letter calling on their leaders to resist Mr. Trump’s demands. And the president of M.I.T. spoke out against the Trump administration’s treatment of its international students.\n\n\nNYTimes: It’s Time to Protect America From America’s President\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/trump-harvard-abrego-garcia.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n&lt; All this illuminates an administration that is not only authoritarian but also reckless; this is vandalism of the American project. That is why this moment is a test of our ability to step up and protect our national greatness from our national leader.\n\nNYTimes: Time for a Civic Uprising\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/opinion/trump-harvard-law-firms.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nDavid Brooks drops the partisan digs and gets right at it:\n\nTrumpism is threatening all of that. It is primarily about the acquisition of power — power for its own sake. It is a multifront assault to make the earth a playground for ruthless men, so of course any institutions that might restrain power must be weakened or destroyed. Trumpism is about ego, appetite and acquisitiveness and is driven by a primal aversion to the higher elements of the human spirit — learning, compassion, scientific wonder, the pursuit of justice.\n\n\nThese are not separate battles. This is a single effort to undo the parts of the civilizational order that might restrain Trump’s acquisition of power. And it will take a concerted response to beat it back.\n\n\nSlowly, many of us are realizing that we need to band together. But even these efforts are insular and fragmented.\n\n\nLet’s take the universities.

Garber, wrote in an open letter on Monday.\n\n\nBy saying ‘no’ to Trump, Harvard saves its soul\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/15/harvard-trump-grants-david-ignatius/\n\nWhat’s really going on in this battle for Harvard’s soul? Martin Wolf of the Financial Times argued recently that Trump, like Mao Zedong in China more than 50 years ago, has embarked on a “cultural revolution” that seeks “to overthrow the bureaucratic and cultural elites” that are anchored in the nation’s great universities.\n\n\nLiberal professors aren’t yet forced to wear dunce caps or work in “reeducation camps” in farms and factories. Maybe that’s next. For the moment, a salute to “Fair Harvard,” and how it’s living the motto, veritas.\n\n\nIRS making plans to rescind Harvard’s tax-exempt status | CNN Politics\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/politics/irs-harvard-tax-exempt-status/index.html\n\nTax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!” Trump posted on Truth Social on Tuesday.\n\n(Ed. the AAUP says in 1940 “Institutions of higher education are conducted for the common good…”)\nAlso\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/16/trump-harvard-tax-exempt-irs/\n\nNYTimes: With Harvard Threat, Trump Tries to Bend the I.R.S. to His Will\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/politics/trump-irs.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDonald Trump Tries to Run Harvard\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-harvard-funding-conditions-constitution-congress-c26040f8?st=7rCN8r&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the government may not use federal benefits or funds to coerce parties to surrender their constitutional rights. This is what the Administration is doing by demanding Harvard accede to “viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\nThe Administration is also overstepping its authority by imposing sweeping conditions on funds that weren’t spelled out by Congress. The Justices held in Cummings (2022) that “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously” to ensure the recipient “voluntarily and knowingly accept[ed] the terms.”\n\n\nWhat Harvard Has Set the Stage For\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/harvard-university-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Thanks EI)\n\nWith these words, Harvard became the first university to officially resist the administration’s abusive intimidation, and it is urgent that it not be the only one. Its actions, supported in recent weeks in statements by other academic leaders, including the presidents of Princeton and Wesleyan, light the way forward on a vital path to fighting President Trump’s war on the independence of higher education.\n\n\nIf universities accept Mr. Trump’s terms, on the other hand, the consequence would be far greater, undermining the very purpose of an independent institution.\n\n\nHarvard Had No Choice\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/harvard-had-no-choice\n\nThus, its decision deserves either praise for courage or condemnation for foolhardiness. I choose praise — in no small part because, as we have already seen with Columbia, capitulation to President Trump’s demands brings only more demands. There’s no point in selling your soul if all you receive in exchange is a worthless IOU.\n\n\nThe anti-intellectual ideologues (no, that’s not an oxymoron) running education policy within and adjacent to the White House do not wish to reform higher education; they want to break it.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: If You’re Boycotting Columbia, Your Priorities Are All Wrong\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/columbia-university-boycott-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThen came the circular firing squad. By mid-April, 2,000 people and more than 75 organizations, most of them faculty groups, had signed onto a boycott of our events, and said they would refuse to work with Columbia scholars, like myself, a vice dean, who hold administrative positions.\n\n\nOne of the main organizers of the boycott, the City University of New York anthropologist Gary Wilder, has struggled to explain this strange form of solidarity.\n\nBut\n\nColumbia would not allow any government to deny professors their rightful role in personnel decisions or to dictate the content of our curricula. Nor would we collaborate with government agents intent on deporting our students and faculty members simply because they exercised their First Amendment rights. At no point did our leadership concede any of these essential principles, which is surely why Columbia has been under Department of Justice investigation “for harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus.”\n\n\nNow that Harvard University has decided to defy the Trump administration, the stage is set for an epic struggle, one that has already defied the expectations of cynics on both sides. After being presented with new demands, Columbia is refusing to comply. No thanks to our fair-weather friends, our acting president, Claire Shipman, has vowed to reject any agreement in which “the government dictates what we teach, research or who we hire” as well as one that would “require us to relinquish our independence and autonomy as an educational institution.” Columbia alumni are rallying in support.\n\n\nThe greatness of American universities is at risk because anti-intellectuals are undermining the foundation of academic excellence: the ability of teachers and researchers to work without political micromanagement in the pursuit of truth, even when these truths are unpopular. Colleges and universities should join a mutual defense pact, as faculty members at several universities, including Rutgers and Indiana University have proposed. If we speak with one voice, we can better articulate the essential importance of universities to the American way of life.\n\n\nWe have now seen that the Trump administration manages the economy with the same expertise and competence it manages higher education, and as a result we might begin to rally the American people. If, instead, academics choose to boycott colleagues rather than stand with them, they become accomplices in the very assault on academic freedom they wish to oppose.\n\n\n\n\n\nCornell Sues DOE for ‘Unlawful’ Cuts to Indirect Costs for Research Grants - The Cornell Daily Sun\n\nhttps://www.cornellsun.com/article/2025/04/breaking-cornell-sues-doe-following-1-billion-funding-freeze\n\nACE and others file lawsuite to prevent DOE cuts\n\nhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.283318/gov.uscourts.mad.283318.1.0.pdf\n\n\n\n\nBrown Takes Out $300 Million Loan\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/17/brown-takes-out-300-million-loan\n\nBoth Harvard University and Princeton University announced in recent weeks that they were issuing bonds.

For the moment, a salute to “Fair Harvard,” and how it’s living the motto, veritas.\n\n\nIRS making plans to rescind Harvard’s tax-exempt status | CNN Politics\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/politics/irs-harvard-tax-exempt-status/index.html\n\nTax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!” Trump posted on Truth Social on Tuesday.\n\n(Ed. the AAUP says in 1940 “Institutions of higher education are conducted for the common good…”)\nAlso\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/16/trump-harvard-tax-exempt-irs/\n\nNYTimes: With Harvard Threat, Trump Tries to Bend the I.R.S. to His Will\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/politics/trump-irs.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDonald Trump Tries to Run Harvard\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-harvard-funding-conditions-constitution-congress-c26040f8?st=7rCN8r&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the government may not use federal benefits or funds to coerce parties to surrender their constitutional rights. This is what the Administration is doing by demanding Harvard accede to “viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\nThe Administration is also overstepping its authority by imposing sweeping conditions on funds that weren’t spelled out by Congress. The Justices held in Cummings (2022) that “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously” to ensure the recipient “voluntarily and knowingly accept[ed] the terms.”\n\n\nWhat Harvard Has Set the Stage For\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/harvard-university-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Thanks EI)\n\nWith these words, Harvard became the first university to officially resist the administration’s abusive intimidation, and it is urgent that it not be the only one. Its actions, supported in recent weeks in statements by other academic leaders, including the presidents of Princeton and Wesleyan, light the way forward on a vital path to fighting President Trump’s war on the independence of higher education.\n\n\nIf universities accept Mr. Trump’s terms, on the other hand, the consequence would be far greater, undermining the very purpose of an independent institution.\n\n\nHarvard Had No Choice\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/harvard-had-no-choice\n\nThus, its decision deserves either praise for courage or condemnation for foolhardiness. I choose praise — in no small part because, as we have already seen with Columbia, capitulation to President Trump’s demands brings only more demands. There’s no point in selling your soul if all you receive in exchange is a worthless IOU.\n\n\nThe anti-intellectual ideologues (no, that’s not an oxymoron) running education policy within and adjacent to the White House do not wish to reform higher education; they want to break it.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: If You’re Boycotting Columbia, Your Priorities Are All Wrong\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/columbia-university-boycott-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThen came the circular firing squad. By mid-April, 2,000 people and more than 75 organizations, most of them faculty groups, had signed onto a boycott of our events, and said they would refuse to work with Columbia scholars, like myself, a vice dean, who hold administrative positions.\n\n\nOne of the main organizers of the boycott, the City University of New York anthropologist Gary Wilder, has struggled to explain this strange form of solidarity.\n\nBut\n\nColumbia would not allow any government to deny professors their rightful role in personnel decisions or to dictate the content of our curricula. Nor would we collaborate with government agents intent on deporting our students and faculty members simply because they exercised their First Amendment rights. At no point did our leadership concede any of these essential principles, which is surely why Columbia has been under Department of Justice investigation “for harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus.”\n\n\nNow that Harvard University has decided to defy the Trump administration, the stage is set for an epic struggle, one that has already defied the expectations of cynics on both sides. After being presented with new demands, Columbia is refusing to comply. No thanks to our fair-weather friends, our acting president, Claire Shipman, has vowed to reject any agreement in which “the government dictates what we teach, research or who we hire” as well as one that would “require us to relinquish our independence and autonomy as an educational institution.” Columbia alumni are rallying in support.\n\n\nThe greatness of American universities is at risk because anti-intellectuals are undermining the foundation of academic excellence: the ability of teachers and researchers to work without political micromanagement in the pursuit of truth, even when these truths are unpopular. Colleges and universities should join a mutual defense pact, as faculty members at several universities, including Rutgers and Indiana University have proposed. If we speak with one voice, we can better articulate the essential importance of universities to the American way of life.\n\n\nWe have now seen that the Trump administration manages the economy with the same expertise and competence it manages higher education, and as a result we might begin to rally the American people. If, instead, academics choose to boycott colleagues rather than stand with them, they become accomplices in the very assault on academic freedom they wish to oppose.\n\n\n\n\n\nCornell Sues DOE for ‘Unlawful’ Cuts to Indirect Costs for Research Grants - The Cornell Daily Sun\n\nhttps://www.cornellsun.com/article/2025/04/breaking-cornell-sues-doe-following-1-billion-funding-freeze\n\nACE and others file lawsuite to prevent DOE cuts\n\nhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.283318/gov.uscourts.mad.283318.1.0.pdf\n\n\n\n\nBrown Takes Out $300 Million Loan\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/17/brown-takes-out-300-million-loan\n\nBoth Harvard University and Princeton University announced in recent weeks that they were issuing bonds.

The real reasons, I think, are anti-intellectualism and greed, and the fact that Trump is building a mafia state.\n\n\nNow, a mafia state is an absolutely centralized system in which one person, the patron, the don, distributes money and power. And so in order to build a mafia state, such an aspiring patron needs to strip other agents of their money and power.\n\n\nAnd it has the ability to, if not bankrupt universities — it certainly has the ability to bankrupt universities that don’t have significant endowments, which is most of them.\n\n\nThe only way for universities to really address this is to come to terms with the fact that there is no way for them, with this administration, to keep their federal money.\n\n\nFor more on the steps the administration has signaled it might do to gain obesiance, this AAUP white paper from 2024 offers much insight (shared by VC):\n\nhttps://www.aaup.org/file/Manufacturing_Backlash_final_1.pdf\n\nwe have witnessed what one scholar correctly called an “unusually brazen series of challenges to academic freedom,” unleashed by conservative activists and a “national-level political machine” … to undermine academic freedom and university autonomy.\n\nIncluding academic gag orders seeking to ban the teaching of “critical race theory” (CRT); shuttering academic programs; dismantling institutional efforts to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion; weaken tenure protections for faculty; undermined the accreditation process; establish academic programs, centers, and whole schools designed to teach conservative content;\n\nAs this white paper demonstrates, however, this legislation is largely the outgrowth of efforts by right-wing and libertarian think tanks, working closely with Republican politicians, to manufacture a culture-war backlash against educators and academic institutions … as part of a well-organized and well-funded backlash that seeks to roll back the political, social, and cultural gains made in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement increased queer and trans visibility.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Insatiable\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/trump-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n&lt; In order to function effectively, Democracies depend on the ability of the electorate to make what Jackson calls “informed choices.” In this context, Jackson writes, “Knowledge institutions — including universities, the truth-oriented press, government offices with data collection or scientific responsibilities — are crucial for constitutional democracies.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s DOJ Claims Academic Journals Hold “Partisan” Stance in Scientific Debates – Mother Jones\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/04/trump-doj-academic-journals-scientific-debates-chest-journal/\n\nThe publisher of CHEST, a prestigious, peer-reviewed medical journal focused on respiratory health, received a letter from the Trump administration seeking information about how its editors handle scientific controversies and “competing viewpoints.” Some medical professionals see the missive as an attempt to stifle academic freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-DEI Guidance Letter Put On Hold, for Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/24/education-departments-anti-dei-guidance-blocked\n\nFederal judges in New Hampshire and Maryland handed down the rulings after finding plaintiffs in the two separate lawsuits were likely to succeed in proving that the Feb. 14 Dear Colleague letter violated procedural standards and the First Amendment. Prior to the orders, colleges and K-12 schools that failed to comply with the letter risked their federal funding\n\n\n“Although the 2025 letter does not make clear what exactly it prohibits, it makes at least one thing clear: schools should not come close to anything that could be considered ‘DEI,’ lest they be deemed to have guessed wrong,” the New Hampshire judge wrote. And since loss of federal grants could cripple institutions, “it is predictable—if not obvious—that [they] will eliminate all vestiges of DEI to avoid even the possibility of funding termination,” regardless of whether it is an example of executive overreach.\n\n\n\n\n\nMahmoud Khalil: What does my detention by ICE say about America?\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4czL2dT\n\nDetained Tufts student must be transferred to Vermont, judge rules\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/04/19/judge-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-vermont-ice/\n\nFearing Trump’s Visa Crackdown, College Students Race to Scrub Op-Eds - WSJ\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-student-visas-newspaper-op-eds-61595294\n\n\n\n\nWeekly NIH Funding Opportunities and Notices for April 18, 2025\n\n\n(none)\n\n(Thanks MP)\n\nUpdates on NSF Priorities | NSF - National Science Foundation\n\nhttps://www.nsf.gov/updates-on-priorities\n\nResearch projects with more narrow impact limited to subgroups of people based on protected class or characteristics do not effectuate NSF priorities.\n\n\n\nWhat types of awards are being terminated?

She received no official explanation for why the grant was being terminated more than a year ahead of its scheduled end. But Dr. Fiesler speculated that it had something to do with the word “misinformation” in the award’s abstract.\n\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the N.S.F. said that its grant cancellations were not in violation of the temporary restraining order. When asked by The Times to provide clarification on the legality of the grant cancellations, the agency declined to comment.\n\n\nLast Thursday, the magazine Nature reported that all new research grants by the agency had been frozen, as ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The N.S.F. declined to confirm the freezing of new awards or what role, if any, DOGE had in the action.\n\n\nNSF Director Resigns\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/25/nsf-director-panchanathan-resigns\n\nHis resignation comes less than one week after he issued sweeping priority changes—including terminating funding for projects that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion or combating misinformation—at the independent agency that funds billions of dollars to nonmedical university research each year.\n\n\n“I believe that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency and feel that it is time to pass the baton to new leadership,” Panchanathan wrote in a resignation letter, first reported by Science. “I am deeply grateful to the presidents for the opportunity to serve our nation.”\n\n\nUnder Panchanathan’s leadership, the NSF’s stated priorities have included increasing diversity in the STEM workforce, forming industry partnerships, job creation and broadening research opportunities for smaller universities and community colleges.\n\n\nTrump is destroying 100 years of competitive advantage in 100 days\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/25/us-losing-competitive-edge-science/\n\nAll three of these forces are now being reversed.

But CUNY is not a university with deep pockets. We don’t have an endowment that we can draw on for these kinds of things.”\n\nIn the Chancellor’s “Stand Together” email we have:\n\nWe are evaluating how changes to funding from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy and other federal agencies will impact our research and programming. Cuts in NIH reimbursements, for example, for operational costs of research and training are being challenged in court, but should they be carried out we estimate that CUNY would receive only about 35% of our expected $12.7 million payment on currently active grants. In addition, 61 CUNY research projects have been subject to stop-work orders from federal agencies.\n\n\nFlorida’s Own DOGE Reviews Faculty Research, Grants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/04/25/floridas-own-doge-reviewing-faculty-research-grants\n\nEarlier this month, the Florida DOGE asked public college and university presidents to provide an account—by the end of last week—of “all research published by staff” over the last six years, including “Papers and drafts made available to the public or in online academic repositories for drafts, preprints, or similar materials.”\n\n\n“If not contained therein, author’s name, title, and position at the institution” must be provided, according to the letters the presidents received. The letters didn’t say what this and other requests were for.\n\n\nThe Florida DOGE also requested information on all grants awarded to institutions over the last six years, asking for each institution’s policy on allocating grants “for purposes of indirect cost recovery, including procedures for calculation.” Further, it requested an account of “all filled and vacant positions held by any employee with a non-instructional role.”\n\n\nBy the end of April, Florida’s public institutions must also provide the “Length of research associated” with each research publication, funding sources associated with the research and any “publications about the research” from the researcher or institution. In addition, the state DOGE is requesting funding sources for each institution’s noninstructional positions and the names of the nonstudent employees administering the grants.\n\n\nAnd that may not be the end of the DOGE demands…\n\n\n\n\n\n“Trump to Sign Executive Order Targeting University Accreditors”\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-accreditors-executive-order-universities-4e4366cc?mod=djemalertNEWS\n(Thanks to DAM for this link).\n\n“Revoking accreditation is an existential threat for these universities,” said Andrew Gillen, a research fellow at the Cato Institute. “If you lose Pell grants and lose student loans, for most colleges that means you’re done.”\n\n\nSome conservatives have called for stronger changes to the watchdog function of higher education, including proposals to make schools accountable for the federal loans their students take out.

Another order instructed his administration to make it more difficult for universities to obscure details of foreign funding.\n\n\nTwo other orders focused on student discipline, which has been a political flashpoint for the past decade.\n\n\nOne order was to ensure that disciplinary policies were not based on D.E.I. policies.

On Monday, he froze $2.2 billion in federal funding after the university rejected a far-reaching list of contradictory demands, including the hiring of an external auditor to evaluate the “viewpoint diversity” of its students, faculty, staff and leadership. On Wednesday, Treasury asked the IRS to consider revoking Harvard’s tax-exempt status. (Donations to the university could dry up if they’re not tax-deductible.) Next, the Department of Homeland Security threatened to revoke Harvard’s ability to host international students, who make up 27 percent of the student body. In the coming months, Trump and congressional allies hope to impose devastating taxes on university endowment funds — Vice President Vance has suggested as high as 35 percent — and plan to scrutinize their investments in China and clean energy.\n\n\nAcademic freedom is worth defending. In the long term, this might require colleges to reduce their dependence on federal dollars. In the short term, schools should stick together to resist Trump’s unlawful dictates on what they teach and whom they hire. It is heartening that Harvard’s defiance is already helping to stiffen the backbones of college administrators elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Cornell Cancels Kehlani Performance Over Her Stance on the War in Gaza\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/nyregion/kehlani-cornell-concert-replaced.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump and Vance fear universities for a reason\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4juE7ow\n\nPresident Trump has tested his authority with such force that other institutions—universities, law firms and many lawmakers—have started to fight back\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-authority-resistance-law-firms-universities-424632ae?st=ZS9Wx4&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nCan Colleges Survive Trump’s Cuts\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/can-colleges-survive-trumps-cuts\n\nThe cost of Trump’s proposals could exceed $100 million per year for dozens of institutions, according to analysis by the economist Phillip Levine. And yet the Trump administration has gone even further by withholding nearly all federal grant funding from some elite institutions. Columbia University tried to preserve $400 million in federal funding by agreeing to a list of onerous federal demands that get into the minutiae of academic governance, but even that has not satisfied the federal government.\n\n\nBlue-state public flagship universities are likely the next target, and even institutions that avoid such politicized attention are likely to suffer from structural cuts in federal grants and contracts. These cuts have happened so suddenly that some universities began to take action immediately in order to preserve cash flow, a key lesson from the pandemic. But this is also a longer-term financial issue as 45 months remain in the Trump administration, and there is no guarantee that federal funding returns to normal in 2029.\n\n(Of the 4 steps suggested, only “Conduct layoffs and hiring and spending freezes” appears applicable to CUNY.)\n\nTo this point, the federal government has promised that financial aid to students, the largest source of federal funding to most universities, will not be affected by cuts elsewhere in the Department of Education. But it is possible that the federal government tries to selectively pull federal financial-aid eligibility,\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Tried to Derail Our Work.

The project needed to continue. And so with encouragement from friends and mentors, my collaborators and I began reaching out — to potential partners, funders and publishers.\n\n\nWhat we found wasn’t just financial support.

European universities are courting top American scientists and researchers en masse with offers of “academic asylum.” The European Research Council has doubled the funding it offers researchers to move to the continent to €2 million ($2.3 million). A bloc of 12 EU nations are working together to fast-track visas, Horizon Europe grants, and relocation stipends in an effort to poach U.S. brainpower in accordance with their own strategic priorities.\n\n(Scientists leaving Germany in 1939 was one of three reasons for the growth in US research accomplishments in the Zakaria op-ed https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/25/us-losing-competitive-edge-science/)\n\n\n\n\nWhite House Partners With Hillsdale for Lecture Series\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/25/white-house-partners-hillsdale-lecture-series\n\nThe Trump administration also worked with Hillsdale at the end of the president’s first term.

The real reasons, I think, are anti-intellectualism and greed, and the fact that Trump is building a mafia state.\n\n\nNow, a mafia state is an absolutely centralized system in which one person, the patron, the don, distributes money and power. And so in order to build a mafia state, such an aspiring patron needs to strip other agents of their money and power.\n\n\nAnd it has the ability to, if not bankrupt universities — it certainly has the ability to bankrupt universities that don’t have significant endowments, which is most of them.\n\n\nThe only way for universities to really address this is to come to terms with the fact that there is no way for them, with this administration, to keep their federal money.\n\n\nFor more on the steps the administration has signaled it might do to gain obesiance, this AAUP white paper from 2024 offers much insight (shared by VC):\n\nhttps://www.aaup.org/file/Manufacturing_Backlash_final_1.pdf\n\nwe have witnessed what one scholar correctly called an “unusually brazen series of challenges to academic freedom,” unleashed by conservative activists and a “national-level political machine” … to undermine academic freedom and university autonomy.\n\nIncluding academic gag orders seeking to ban the teaching of “critical race theory” (CRT); shuttering academic programs; dismantling institutional efforts to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion; weaken tenure protections for faculty; undermined the accreditation process; establish academic programs, centers, and whole schools designed to teach conservative content;\n\nAs this white paper demonstrates, however, this legislation is largely the outgrowth of efforts by right-wing and libertarian think tanks, working closely with Republican politicians, to manufacture a culture-war backlash against educators and academic institutions … as part of a well-organized and well-funded backlash that seeks to roll back the political, social, and cultural gains made in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement increased queer and trans visibility.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Insatiable\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/trump-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n&lt; In order to function effectively, Democracies depend on the ability of the electorate to make what Jackson calls “informed choices.” In this context, Jackson writes, “Knowledge institutions — including universities, the truth-oriented press, government offices with data collection or scientific responsibilities — are crucial for constitutional democracies.”",

But Dr. Fiesler speculated that it had something to do with the word “misinformation” in the award’s abstract.\n\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the N.S.F. said that its grant cancellations were not in violation of the temporary restraining order. When asked by The Times to provide clarification on the legality of the grant cancellations, the agency declined to comment.\n\n\nLast Thursday, the magazine Nature reported that all new research grants by the agency had been frozen, as ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

The letters didn’t say what this and other requests were for.\n\n\nThe Florida DOGE also requested information on all grants awarded to institutions over the last six years, asking for each institution’s policy on allocating grants “for purposes of indirect cost recovery, including procedures for calculation.” Further, it requested an account of “all filled and vacant positions held by any employee with a non-instructional role.”\n\n\nBy the end of April, Florida’s public institutions must also provide the “Length of research associated” with each research publication, funding sources associated with the research and any “publications about the research” from the researcher or institution. In addition, the state DOGE is requesting funding sources for each institution’s noninstructional positions and the names of the nonstudent employees administering the grants.\n\n\nAnd that may not be the end of the DOGE demands…",

On Monday, he froze $2.2 billion in federal funding after the university rejected a far-reaching list of contradictory demands, including the hiring of an external auditor to evaluate the “viewpoint diversity” of its students, faculty, staff and leadership. On Wednesday, Treasury asked the IRS to consider revoking Harvard’s tax-exempt status. (Donations to the university could dry up if they’re not tax-deductible.) Next, the Department of Homeland Security threatened to revoke Harvard’s ability to host international students, who make up 27 percent of the student body. In the coming months, Trump and congressional allies hope to impose devastating taxes on university endowment funds — Vice President Vance has suggested as high as 35 percent — and plan to scrutinize their investments in China and clean energy.\n\n\nAcademic freedom is worth defending. In the long term, this might require colleges to reduce their dependence on federal dollars. In the short term, schools should stick together to resist Trump’s unlawful dictates on what they teach and whom they hire.

And yet the Trump administration has gone even further by withholding nearly all federal grant funding from some elite institutions. Columbia University tried to preserve $400 million in federal funding by agreeing to a list of onerous federal demands that get into the minutiae of academic governance, but even that has not satisfied the federal government.\n\n\nBlue-state public flagship universities are likely the next target, and even institutions that avoid such politicized attention are likely to suffer from structural cuts in federal grants and contracts. These cuts have happened so suddenly that some universities began to take action immediately in order to preserve cash flow, a key lesson from the pandemic. But this is also a longer-term financial issue as 45 months remain in the Trump administration, and there is no guarantee that federal funding returns to normal in 2029.\n\n(Of the 4 steps suggested, only “Conduct layoffs and hiring and spending freezes” appears applicable to CUNY.)\n\nTo this point, the federal government has promised that financial aid to students, the largest source of federal funding to most universities, will not be affected by cuts elsewhere in the Department of Education.

And so with encouragement from friends and mentors, my collaborators and I began reaching out — to potential partners, funders and publishers.\n\n\nWhat we found wasn’t just financial support. It was energy. It was courage. People understood the urgency and the opportunity. And together, we began to reimagine the work not just as a continuation of what had been cut short but also as something new and more alive. A rigorous, independent effort to tell the story of nature in America.\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s freeze on $2.2 billion to Harvard provided no proof of wrongdoing\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/17/harvard-trump-grant-freeze-antisemitism/\n\nNYTimes: Trump Officials Blame Mistake for Setting Off Confrontation With Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/trump-harvard-letter-mistake.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Sure…)\n\nHarvard pushes back on claim that Trump team mistakenly sent demand letter\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/19/harvard-trump-letter-mistake-unauthorized/\n\nNYTimes: In Trump Attack on Harvard, Punishment Before Proof\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/trump-harvard-legal-process.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration has grown so furious with Harvard that it is planning to pull an additional $1 billion of the school’s funding for health research\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-administration-irate-at-harvard-will-pull-additional-1-billion-in-funding-8c209113?st=54dT6c&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nThe government’s set of demands was mistakenly sent a day earlier than the task force intended, but its contents weren’t an error, people familiar with the task force said.

That idea has found quite wide use)\n\nNow the Heritage contingent was in Israel, in part, to discuss another contentious policy paper: Project Esther, the foundation’s proposal to rapidly dismantle the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States, along with its support at schools and universities, at progressive organizations and in Congress.\n\n\nDrafted in the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel in 2023 and the mounting protests against the war in Gaza, Project Esther outlined an ambitious plan to fight antisemitism by branding a broad range of critics of Israel as “effectively a terrorist support network,” so that they could be deported, defunded, sued, fired, expelled, ostracized and otherwise excluded from what it considered “open society.”\n\n\nProject Esther’s architects envisioned outcomes that at the time might have seemed far-fetched. Curriculum it believed to be sympathetic to a “Hamas support” narrative would be taken out of schools and universities, and “supporting faculty” would be removed. Social media would be purged of content deemed to be antisemitic. Institutions would lose public funding. Foreign students who pushed for Palestinian rights would have their visas revoked, or be deported.\n\n\nHeritage national security director who coauthored Project Esther, said it was “no coincidence that we called for a series of actions to take place privately and publicly, and they are now happening.”\n\n\nBut Project Esther aims to go further, equating actions such as participating in pro-Palestinian campus protests with providing “material support” for terrorism, a broad legal construct that can lead to prison time, deportations, civil penalties and other serious consequences.\n\n\n“Project Esther changed the paradigm by associating anyone who opposes Israeli policies with the ‘Hamas Support Network,’”\n\n\nSome evangelical Christians have increasingly aligned themselves with conservative political forces in Israel, supporting their claims of biblical dominion over contested Palestinian territories. Many feel a kinship with Israel because of shared religious heritage. But some also believe that supporting Israel will hasten biblical end times, or advance Christianity’s global influence.\n\n\nThe Visionary of Trump 2.0 - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/russell-vought-trump-doge/682821/\n(Russel Vought takes over for Elon Musk in efforts to kill this federal government.

At the same time, public and private research universities, which depend heavily on international students’ tuition and labor—especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines—are facing the erosion of a vital economic pillar. These developments threaten not only the foundational rights of free speech and academic freedom but also the financial stability of the institutions that anchor the U.S. higher education system and conduct the vital research on which the future will be built.\n\n\nFar from isolated incidents, these cases reflect an emerging strategy—leveraging immigration enforcement as a tool of political suppression. International students have become an ideal scapegoat: politically vulnerable, culturally diverse, and often outspoken. Immigration officials now claim broad authority to revoke visas for “supporting terrorism,” using vague, expansive definitions. The result is a chilling effect on campus expression and a stark warning to those who would protest U.S. policy.\n\n\nFor academic leaders like Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, the strategy is transparent. “They want to undermine higher education and also heighten the new Cold War on campus,” Wolfson said.\n\nIs the University Of Austin Betraying Its Founding Principles?\nhttps://quillette.com/2025/05/16/is-the-university-of-austin-betraying-its-founding-principles/\n\nSkilled immigration on the chopping block? Effects of eliminating “Optional Practical Training” in the US | PIIE\n\nhttps://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/skilled-immigration-chopping-block-effects-eliminating-optional\n\nThat may soon change. The US administration is under pressure to constrict or eliminate the largest single pipeline into lawful immigration for high-skilled, university-educated workers. This pipeline is called Optional Practical Training (OPT)—a temporary work permit given to some foreign graduates of US universities.\n\n\nOptional Practical Training is a federal program that allows most international students at US universities the choice to work in the United States for a limited period after they graduate. About 72 percent of foreign graduates use OPT. The permit generally lasts one year but extends to three years for graduates at any educational level in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is a work permit attached to the student visa, a bridge between university enrollment and the workforce, granted under regulations starting in 1947.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nThis [expecting a renaissance of rich controversies], of course, is politically naïve. As the historian of science Michael Hagner predicted in 2019, the commitment of right-wing populists to epistemic pluralism only lasts until they manage to establish their own views well enough to eliminate all other points of view. Consider book bans, grant cancellations, and the violation of the First Amendment rights of foreign students and faculty and you will find validated Hagner’s cynical perspective on the authoritarian promotion of viewpoint diversity.\n\n\nBoth Harding and Haidt put their fingers on a very real problem: Our collective thinking benefits from looking at any given issue from multiple angles. For all sorts of historical reasons, colleges often do not represent a spectrum that is broad enough.\n\n\nThis balancing act requires what Aristotle called phronesis, the capacity for good judgment, and it cannot be formalized through viewpoint-diversity audits and affirmative-action policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Comey questioning, the Trump administration again targets speech\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/17/trump-freedom-of-speech-critics/\n(Just 4 numbers is enough now…)\n\nCollege newspapers under pressure as immigration fears silence sources\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/17/college-newspapers-trump-international-students/\n\nFree speech is dead at the American university.

I think, from my vantage point, one of the greatest concerns is seeing students, and particularly international students, being, basically, taken away on what appears to be the basis of viewpoints and opinions that they might have shared, either in the form of protest or, in one case, an op-ed. That really flies in the face of exactly what the First Amendment is supposed to protect against, especially in a public institution, which is that it’s supposed to be a restraint on government.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Times Sq.

But there have been instances in which antisemitic images from earlier periods have been erroneously linked to the more recent pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia.\n\n\nThe announcement comes as the Trump administration is engaged in negotiations with Columbia over federal funding. The administration cut $400 million in contracts and grants to the school in March, saying the university had failed to sufficiently clamp down on acts of antisemitism on its campus.\n\n(Just guessing, but that 400 number will seem quaint)\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica and Its Universities Need a New Social Contract - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/stem-academia-universities-citizenship-civics/682384/\n\nWe must do what should have been done long ago: find our way to a new social contract between universities and the American people.\n\n\nLiner Note 25.

What are the university system’s next moves?\n\n(Of these, CUNY is doing all of these; but this listing of the ten-dimensional fiscal risk is interesting:\n\nBlanket reductions of indirect cost recovery funds… Cancellation of existing grants… Reduced awarding of grants … Freezing of awarded grants. …Non-allocation of funds for awarded and uncancelled grants …Retaliatory bulk funding impounding at targeted universities… Cuts to student-related federal funding….

Brandon Jones, president of the American Geophysical Union: Scientific societies — professional organizations that represent researchers in specific fields — have a long history of stepping in when politics interferes with research. After the Trump administration suspended work in April on the U.S. government’s flagship report on the impacts of climate change, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society partnered with plans to publish some of the research so the public can still access the findings.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a mini N.I.H. Andrew Marks, professor of physiology at Columbia University: We need a new funding model for science research. I propose the creation of the American Research Collaborative, a kind of mini-National Institutes of Health that could provide funding for universities. The A.R.C. would be led by a governing board elected by member organizations like the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Universities could opt in, and the collaborative’s tax-exempt status would attract private donors. a\n\n\n\n\nBuild new alliances. Dr. Jane Lubchenco, co-founder of United by Nature: In January, over 100 scientists outside the federal government were struggling to come to grips with the administration’s cancellation of years of work on what would have been the first ever federal assessment of nature. We refused to quit. So we created a new path to deliver the report and show why the information matters. The initiative, called United by Nature, will have a governing body, advisers and partners, independent peer review and extensive public engagement.\n\n\n\nNYTimes: The President Will Destroy You Now\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/opinion/trump-musk-doge-government.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe war on academic research will have long-lasting implications for technical innovation in America. Scientists who cannot support their labs while President Trump holds their funds hostage for the sake of MAGA theater over the next four years will take their labs elsewhere.\n\n\nChina will be a winner in this. Uncertainty about government commitments will make it harder for investors to take basic and applied research in universities and move it to market. The longer the time horizon for investments, the more trust and stability matter. In the end, disrupters like Trump and Musk leave us with a much bigger legacy of doubt and uncertainty than achievement.\n\n\nMost Colleges Aren’t a Target of Trump (Yet). Here’s How Their Presidents Are Leading.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/most-colleges-arent-a-target-of-trump-yet-heres-how-their-presidents-are-leading\n\nStill, campus leaders at community colleges and four-year public regional and private institutions — representing the vast majority of higher ed — say they do see impacts of Trump’s policies. Fear, particularly about the future of financial aid and immigration crackdowns, is pervasive.\n\n\nBut the college [Delta] is also planning for contingencies. “If somehow the government is going to withhold federal financial-aid dollars going to students based on something,” Gavin said, “then that will be where we have to change.”\n\n\nDavid Tandberg, president of Adams State University, said he has tried to sort the administration’s actions into several buckets based on whether they would have a direct impact on his campus — a public regional institution in rural, southern Colorado — and whether they’re probably just rhetoric. “We’re seeing all of those, and it takes a lot to sort through them,” Tandberg said. “The first month it was coming like a fire hose.”\n\n\nSimilar to Delta College, an urgent concern for a university like Adams State is whether federal cuts could slow or stop the flow of student financial aid,\n\n\n\n\n\nAt universities from the Ivy League to state schools, a financial reckoning has started as President Trump’s funding cuts hit home\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/university-spending-cuts-layoffs-pay-budget-trump-9f261d14?st=ErRuU9&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nNYTimes: Republican Plan to Tax Elite Colleges Could Hit in Unexpected Places\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/universities-endowment-tax-republicans.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe goal of the proposal, laid out in a report last week from Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, is to hold accountable “woke, elite universities that operate more like major corporations.” McPherson [small school that accepts the vast majority of its applicants] could be on the list because it has an endowment of $1.6 billion, thanks to an anonymous donation a few years ago.\n\n(Don’t cry for McPherson, cry that this stealing from the rich to give to the richer is even being proposed.)\n\nChinese College Gives Harvard International Students ‘Unconditional Offers’ - Newsweek\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/harvard-hkust-china-college-international-students-offer-2076257\n\n\n\n\nHow I Lost Faith in My University’s Mission\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/05/19/how-i-lost-faith-my-universitys-mission-opinion\n(Look at all the interventions from outside that have happened at the University of Utah)\n\nthe State Legislature passed an anti-DEI bill, prohibiting, among other things, offices and programs related to diversity, equity or inclusion. Administrators were required to purge these three words from university websites and other documents, such as RPT—retention, promotion and tenure review—guidelines, and the university administration interpreted the law as requiring that the Women’s Resource Center, the Black Cultural Center and the LGBT Resource Center be shuttered.\n\n\nThe state has also imposed a “bathroom bill” requiring trans university students to use locker rooms aligning with their sex assigned at birth, has banned Pride flags in public spaces (and in faculty offices if they can be seen through a window), and now requires faculty to post their syllabi in a publicly searchable database. It also prohibits university presidents from taking a stand on any issue that does not bear upon the “mission, role or pedagogical objectives” of the institution. And finally, as the coup de grâce for academic freedom and faculty expertise, it has funded and established the Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that all students take general education courses on the topics of Western civilization and the rise of Christianity. The law establishing the center identifies it as a pilot program to be rolled out to other Utah universities in the future.\n\n\nRecently passed laws dictate the process by which all post-tenure reviews of faculty must be conducted, curtail shared governance and cut state funds to all Utah public institutions by 10 percent ($60.5 million). Universities can have the funds “reallocated” if they use them for high-demand, high-wage majors. As a result, we lost our History and Philosophy of Science major, which drew some of our best students, many of them double majoring in STEM subjects and working toward careers in medicine and public health.\n\n\n\n\n\nReviewing Course Evaluations: The Drinking Game - McSweeney’s Internet Tendency\n\nhttps://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/reviewing-course-evaluations-the-drinking-game\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

That idea has found quite wide use)\n\nNow the Heritage contingent was in Israel, in part, to discuss another contentious policy paper: Project Esther, the foundation’s proposal to rapidly dismantle the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States, along with its support at schools and universities, at progressive organizations and in Congress.\n\n\nDrafted in the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel in 2023 and the mounting protests against the war in Gaza, Project Esther outlined an ambitious plan to fight antisemitism by branding a broad range of critics of Israel as “effectively a terrorist support network,” so that they could be deported, defunded, sued, fired, expelled, ostracized and otherwise excluded from what it considered “open society.”\n\n\nProject Esther’s architects envisioned outcomes that at the time might have seemed far-fetched. Curriculum it believed to be sympathetic to a “Hamas support” narrative would be taken out of schools and universities, and “supporting faculty” would be removed. Social media would be purged of content deemed to be antisemitic. Institutions would lose public funding. Foreign students who pushed for Palestinian rights would have their visas revoked, or be deported.\n\n\nHeritage national security director who coauthored Project Esther, said it was “no coincidence that we called for a series of actions to take place privately and publicly, and they are now happening.”\n\n\nBut Project Esther aims to go further, equating actions such as participating in pro-Palestinian campus protests with providing “material support” for terrorism, a broad legal construct that can lead to prison time, deportations, civil penalties and other serious consequences.\n\n\n“Project Esther changed the paradigm by associating anyone who opposes Israeli policies with the ‘Hamas Support Network,’”\n\n\nSome evangelical Christians have increasingly aligned themselves with conservative political forces in Israel, supporting their claims of biblical dominion over contested Palestinian territories. Many feel a kinship with Israel because of shared religious heritage. But some also believe that supporting Israel will hasten biblical end times, or advance Christianity’s global influence.\n\n\nThe Visionary of Trump 2.0 - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/russell-vought-trump-doge/682821/\n(Russel Vought takes over for Elon Musk in efforts to kill this federal government. But he is more patient and will have a longer impact)\nOne example is “https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-quietly-kills-rule-to-shield-americans-from-data-brokers/\n\nTrump’s Attacks on International Students Are the Start of a Wider War | The New Republic\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/195142/trump-war-international-students-university\n\nIn recent months, foreign students—particularly those participating in pro-Palestine protests—have had their student visas threatened or have been detained and placed in deportation proceedings, signaling a sharp and politically charged shift in federal policy. At the same time, public and private research universities, which depend heavily on international students’ tuition and labor—especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines—are facing the erosion of a vital economic pillar. These developments threaten not only the foundational rights of free speech and academic freedom but also the financial stability of the institutions that anchor the U.S. higher education system and conduct the vital research on which the future will be built.\n\n\nFar from isolated incidents, these cases reflect an emerging strategy—leveraging immigration enforcement as a tool of political suppression. International students have become an ideal scapegoat: politically vulnerable, culturally diverse, and often outspoken. Immigration officials now claim broad authority to revoke visas for “supporting terrorism,” using vague, expansive definitions. The result is a chilling effect on campus expression and a stark warning to those who would protest U.S. policy.\n\n\nFor academic leaders like Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, the strategy is transparent. “They want to undermine higher education and also heighten the new Cold War on campus,” Wolfson said.\n\nIs the University Of Austin Betraying Its Founding Principles?\nhttps://quillette.com/2025/05/16/is-the-university-of-austin-betraying-its-founding-principles/\n\nSkilled immigration on the chopping block? Effects of eliminating “Optional Practical Training” in the US | PIIE\n\nhttps://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/skilled-immigration-chopping-block-effects-eliminating-optional\n\nThat may soon change. The US administration is under pressure to constrict or eliminate the largest single pipeline into lawful immigration for high-skilled, university-educated workers. This pipeline is called Optional Practical Training (OPT)—a temporary work permit given to some foreign graduates of US universities.\n\n\nOptional Practical Training is a federal program that allows most international students at US universities the choice to work in the United States for a limited period after they graduate. About 72 percent of foreign graduates use OPT. The permit generally lasts one year but extends to three years for graduates at any educational level in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is a work permit attached to the student visa, a bridge between university enrollment and the workforce, granted under regulations starting in 1947.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nThis [expecting a renaissance of rich controversies], of course, is politically naïve. As the historian of science Michael Hagner predicted in 2019, the commitment of right-wing populists to epistemic pluralism only lasts until they manage to establish their own views well enough to eliminate all other points of view. Consider book bans, grant cancellations, and the violation of the First Amendment rights of foreign students and faculty and you will find validated Hagner’s cynical perspective on the authoritarian promotion of viewpoint diversity.\n\n\nBoth Harding and Haidt put their fingers on a very real problem: Our collective thinking benefits from looking at any given issue from multiple angles. For all sorts of historical reasons, colleges often do not represent a spectrum that is broad enough.\n\n\nThis balancing act requires what Aristotle called phronesis, the capacity for good judgment, and it cannot be formalized through viewpoint-diversity audits and affirmative-action policies.",

But there have been instances in which antisemitic images from earlier periods have been erroneously linked to the more recent pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia.\n\n\nThe announcement comes as the Trump administration is engaged in negotiations with Columbia over federal funding. The administration cut $400 million in contracts and grants to the school in March, saying the university had failed to sufficiently clamp down on acts of antisemitism on its campus.\n\n(Just guessing, but that 400 number will seem quaint)",

The Next 100 Days: Don’t Make the Trump Damage Worse (Thanks VAC)\n\nhttps://utotherescue.blogspot.com/2025/05/liner-note-25-next-100-days-dont-make.html\n\nTrump’s opening blitzkrieg has happened, the first defenses are in place, and the colossal damage has been done. What are the university system’s next moves?\n\n(Of these, CUNY is doing all of these; but this listing of the ten-dimensional fiscal risk is interesting:\n\nBlanket reductions of indirect cost recovery funds… Cancellation of existing grants… Reduced awarding of grants … Freezing of awarded grants. …Non-allocation of funds for awarded and uncancelled grants …Retaliatory bulk funding impounding at targeted universities… Cuts to student-related federal funding…. Cuts to Medicaid and other programs\n\n\nNYTimes: On Education, DeSantis’s Florida Paved the Way for Trump’s America\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/us/education-desantis-florida-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n“Far be it for President Trump to be so foolish as to ignore a good idea,” said Tiffany Justice, a founder of Moms for Liberty, the right-wing parental-rights group that was key in shaping Mr. DeSantis’s agenda in Florida.\n\n(In one sentence, the actions of a president, governor, and fringe group head are sanewashed.)\n\nNYTimes: 13 Ways to Save Health and Science\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/opinion/save-health-science-climate.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\nLean on other scientists. Brandon Jones, president of the American Geophysical Union: Scientific societies — professional organizations that represent researchers in specific fields — have a long history of stepping in when politics interferes with research. After the Trump administration suspended work in April on the U.S. government’s flagship report on the impacts of climate change, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society partnered with plans to publish some of the research so the public can still access the findings.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a mini N.I.H. Andrew Marks, professor of physiology at Columbia University: We need a new funding model for science research. I propose the creation of the American Research Collaborative, a kind of mini-National Institutes of Health that could provide funding for universities. The A.R.C. would be led by a governing board elected by member organizations like the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Universities could opt in, and the collaborative’s tax-exempt status would attract private donors. a\n\n\n\n\nBuild new alliances. Dr. Jane Lubchenco, co-founder of United by Nature: In January, over 100 scientists outside the federal government were struggling to come to grips with the administration’s cancellation of years of work on what would have been the first ever federal assessment of nature. We refused to quit. So we created a new path to deliver the report and show why the information matters. The initiative, called United by Nature, will have a governing body, advisers and partners, independent peer review and extensive public engagement.\n\n\n\nNYTimes: The President Will Destroy You Now\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/opinion/trump-musk-doge-government.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe war on academic research will have long-lasting implications for technical innovation in America. Scientists who cannot support their labs while President Trump holds their funds hostage for the sake of MAGA theater over the next four years will take their labs elsewhere.\n\n\nChina will be a winner in this. Uncertainty about government commitments will make it harder for investors to take basic and applied research in universities and move it to market. The longer the time horizon for investments, the more trust and stability matter. In the end, disrupters like Trump and Musk leave us with a much bigger legacy of doubt and uncertainty than achievement.\n\n\nMost Colleges Aren’t a Target of Trump (Yet). Here’s How Their Presidents Are Leading.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/most-colleges-arent-a-target-of-trump-yet-heres-how-their-presidents-are-leading\n\nStill, campus leaders at community colleges and four-year public regional and private institutions — representing the vast majority of higher ed — say they do see impacts of Trump’s policies. Fear, particularly about the future of financial aid and immigration crackdowns, is pervasive.\n\n\nBut the college [Delta] is also planning for contingencies. “If somehow the government is going to withhold federal financial-aid dollars going to students based on something,” Gavin said, “then that will be where we have to change.”\n\n\nDavid Tandberg, president of Adams State University, said he has tried to sort the administration’s actions into several buckets based on whether they would have a direct impact on his campus — a public regional institution in rural, southern Colorado — and whether they’re probably just rhetoric. “We’re seeing all of those, and it takes a lot to sort through them,” Tandberg said. “The first month it was coming like a fire hose.”\n\n\nSimilar to Delta College, an urgent concern for a university like Adams State is whether federal cuts could slow or stop the flow of student financial aid,",

Administrators were required to purge these three words from university websites and other documents, such as RPT—retention, promotion and tenure review—guidelines, and the university administration interpreted the law as requiring that the Women’s Resource Center, the Black Cultural Center and the LGBT Resource Center be shuttered.\n\n\nThe state has also imposed a “bathroom bill” requiring trans university students to use locker rooms aligning with their sex assigned at birth, has banned Pride flags in public spaces (and in faculty offices if they can be seen through a window), and now requires faculty to post their syllabi in a publicly searchable database. It also prohibits university presidents from taking a stand on any issue that does not bear upon the “mission, role or pedagogical objectives” of the institution. And finally, as the coup de grâce for academic freedom and faculty expertise, it has funded and established the Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that all students take general education courses on the topics of Western civilization and the rise of Christianity. The law establishing the center identifies it as a pilot program to be rolled out to other Utah universities in the future.\n\n\nRecently passed laws dictate the process by which all post-tenure reviews of faculty must be conducted, curtail shared governance and cut state funds to all Utah public institutions by 10 percent ($60.5 million). Universities can have the funds “reallocated” if they use them for high-demand, high-wage majors. As a result, we lost our History and Philosophy of Science major, which drew some of our best students, many of them double majoring in STEM subjects and working toward careers in medicine and public health.",

    "text": "Dear All,\nPlease find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.\nA week marked by more efforts to radically change higher education, this week by denying foreign students the ability to study in the US and in particular Harvard (though we now know what TRO means – temporary restraining order)\nThanks BE, EST for sharing!\n\n\n\nUFS Blog on Alliances\n\nhttps://www1.cuny.edu/sites/cunyufs/2025/06/03/faculty-batten-down-and-arm-up-with-compacts/\n(Thanks BE for this!)\n\nStand Together for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.standtogetherhighered.org/\n(Thanks EST)\n\nHigher education is under attack. A coordinated political campaign is working to delegitimize universities, restrict what can be taught, punish open inquiry, and dismantle institutional autonomy. These efforts are already causing real harm—targeting international students, undermining financial aid, making it harder for many to access or afford a college education, and defunding life-enhancing research. They threaten the values that make higher education vital to democracy: free speech, academic freedom, inclusion, and the pursuit of knowledge. To protect those values, we must come together—across campuses, communities, and differences—in common cause.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Alarmed by Trump Cuts, Scientists Are Talking Science. For 100 Hours.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/climate/science-livestream-budget-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDr. Rind’s presentation was the first of many in a planned, 100-hour-long livestream featuring hundreds of climate scientists and meteorologists from across the United States. They are protesting cuts to funding for atmospheric science and calling out potential risks to weather forecasts. The livestream started on Wednesday and is scheduled to run continuously through June 1, the first day of the Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Is a Summer to Organize (opinion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/06/03/summer-organize-opinion\n\nFaculty may long for a break, but the government is actively operationalizing Project 2025, a blueprint for remaking every public institution, with higher education being the crown jewel of its antidemocratic agenda. At his 100-day rally in Michigan, Donald Trump declared, “We’ve just gotten started. You haven’t even seen anything yet.” Christopher Rufo, architect of the right-wing culture war, promises to plunge higher education still further into “an existential terror.”\n\n\nWe should be prepared for a potential wave of coordinated assaults on higher education this summer: reductions in Pell Grant eligibility for low-income students and slashed student loans, more dismantlement of scientific research funding, politicized accreditation crackdowns, new endowment taxes, expanded intimidation of international students and scholars, and further weaponization of Title VI and Title IX enforcement.\n\n\nWe recommend mobilizing on two simultaneous fronts this summer: by operationalizing mutual academic defense compacts (MADCs), and through direct activism. We must forge powerful alliances for mass protest. We suggest one often-overlooked but deeply strategic constituency— veterans.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademia’s Holy Warriors\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/academias-holy-warriors/\n\nThe idea is central to Deneen’s [Notre Dame political-science professor] argument in Why Liberalism Failed, which announces America’s failed — past tense — liberal tradition. For Deneen, “liberalism” refers not just to the political beliefs of self-identified liberals or progressives, but also to the broader, rights-based political philosophy that has guided both major political parties for most of American history.\n\n\nAs Deneen was speaking, blueberry pie was served to an audience that included Rod Dreher, the well-known American Conservative blogger and author of The Benedict Option; Matthew Schmitz, an editor of the ecumenical religious journal First Things; and Bria Sandford, editorial director of Penguin’s right-of-center Sentinel book division. The next morning, the New York Times columnist Ross Douthat arrived\n\n\nIn the year and a half since the conference, other writers who have staked out public positions on the nonliberal right include the Harvard law professor Adrian Vermeule, the First Things editor R.R. Reno, the former Washington Examiner managing editor Helen Andrews, and the University of Dallas assistant professor of political science — and deputy editor of the journal American Affairs — Gladden Pappin. One might add Mary Ann Glendon, the Harvard law professor and former ambassador to the Vatican, who in July was named the head of President Trump’s Commission on Unalienable Rights.\n\n\nThe radicals, on the other hand, were those who believed that American liberalism had always been deeply hostile to the core values of Catholics.\n\n\nHarvard Law professor Adrian Vermeule accused Deneen of failing to grapple fully with the consequences of his own diagnosis. … What was needed was not the creation of new societies — which would survive only at the forbearance of the reigning powers — but a coup against the liberal “imperium” from within. … Rather than withdrawing from the power centers of liberal society, Vermeule recommends that administrators and other elites find a “strategic position” from which, as dissatisfaction with liberalism grows, they can turn that bureaucracy to “new ends.”\n\n(Deenan also raises the ire of David Brooks:)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/opinion/trump-vance-morality.html\n\nParks, libraries, museums: here’s why Trump is attacking America’s best-loved institutions | Margaret Sullivan | The Guardian\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/02/national-parks-libraries-museums-trump\n\nIt seems counterintuitive, but this is all a part of a broad plan that the great 20th-century political thinker Hannah Arendt would have understood all too well.\n\n\nTake away natural beauty, free access to books and support for the arts, and you end up with a less enlightened, more ignorant and less engaged public. That’s a public much more easily manipulated.\n\n\n“A people that can no longer believe in anything cannot make up its mind,” said Arendt, a student of authoritarianism, in 1973. Eventually, such a public “is deprived … of its ability to think and judge”, and with people like that, “you can then do what you please”.\n\n\n\n\n\nRed states tell colleges: Race and gender classes are out, civics in\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/02/republican-state-laws-university-college-classes/\n\nNew laws in Ohio, Utah and Florida are reshaping general education, the core classes college students take to meet graduation requirements. The laws mandate that students take civics courses focused on Western civilization and bar classes centered on race or gender from counting toward core requirements.\n\n\nState lawmakers have the authority to regulate curriculums and set requirements for graduation, but higher education experts say that until recently, they have let public colleges and universities lead the way. That began to change in 2020 after the first Trump administration issued an executive order to stamp out “divisive concepts” about race and gender in the federal government, according to the American Association of University Professors and American Federation of Teachers.\n\n\n“This is a new type of local intervention,” said Keith E. Whittington, founding chair of the Academic Committee of the Academic Freedom Alliance. “Some of the proposals are making more elaborate interventions about what the curriculum ought to look like and are also increasingly interested in the content.”\n\n\nHouse Democrats Air Grievances With McMahon\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/05/mcmahon-faces-angry-house-democrats\n\nThe Trump administration has recently criticized what it sees as a lack of viewpoint diversity at Harvard University and demanded that the institution hire more conservative professors if it would like to regain access to federal grant funding. At a Senate hearing Tuesday, McMahon said a federal law that prevents discrimination based on race and national origin gave the department the authority to make such demands.\n\n\nTakano [California Democrat] snapped back, saying, “I think it’s pretty clear you haven’t thought through this idea of viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\nNYTimes: A Professor Was Fired for Her Politics. Is That the Future of Academia?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/magazine/academic-freedom-politics.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut that night, reading Kanazi’s words while taking in the news, she felt a pitch of fury and despair at the rising number of dead in Gaza and her sense that too few Americans were similarly horrified. She believed in her right to state her beliefs and share those of others, like Kanazi, with whom she sympathized. Besides, the post would disappear from her Instagram stories by the following evening.\n\n\nTwo days later, on a Friday, Finkelstein got an email from Jennifer Storm, the director of equity and Title IX at Muhlenberg, asking her to come to a meeting the following Monday — with a lawyer if she wanted one.\n\n\nBut the meeting, which took place a week later on Zoom with Finkelstein’s lawyer present, was entirely about her repost. Finkelstein was told not to return to campus and locked out of her email. Her classes would be reassigned to an adjunct professor while the college hired an outside firm to investigate.\n\n\nThe investigation stretched over the spring semester. Then, in May, Finkelstein received a new letter from the college: She was being fired, with cause. This despite her having tenure, a historic form of academic job protection meant to insulate scholars from the steamrolling power of both politics and public opinion. Less noticed at the time, but arguably more prophetic, was how the mechanics of her firing trammeled yet another longtime standard in the academy, that of professors’ deciding among themselves when and if a colleague should be fired.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration’s big week of gaslighting and censorship\n\nhttps://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-free-speech-harvard-marco-rubio-rfk-jr-censorship-rcna209870\n\nOver the course of the past week alone — in the name of academic, scientific and online “freedom” — Trump and his administration’s bigwigs have explicitly threatened free speech in at least a half-dozen different ways.\n\n\nNYTimes: A Student at Brown Channeled Elon Musk. Then He Got in Trouble.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/brown-university-newspaper-musk-doge.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThousands of administrative employees at Brown University woke up this spring to an email with pointed Elon Musk-like questions about their job responsibilities.\n\n\nPlease describe your role, it asked. What tasks have you performed in the past week? How would Brown students be affected if your job didn’t exist?\n\n\nThe March 18 email was from a sophomore, Alex Shieh, who explained that the responses would be included in a story for The Brown Spectator, a new, as yet unpublished conservative newspaper on campus.\n\n\nTwo days later, Brown notified Mr. Shieh that he was under investigation for possible violations of the university’s code of student conduct, including its prohibitions on invasion of privacy, misrepresentation and emotional or psychological harm.\n\n\nWith that, his case — and that of two Spectator students who were later placed under investigation — became the latest flashpoint in the free speech wars on American college campuses.\n\n\nBrown eventually cleared all three students of wrongdoing. But their case is yet another example of how universities continue to struggle with protecting the rights of students to express themselves on campus, after years of trying to adjudicate just when political expression tips into harassment.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Attacks on Black History Betray America\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/opinion/black-history-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration’s framing of Black history as “D.E.I.” — and “D.E.I.” as harming white Americans — recasts its attack on Black history as protecting white Americans. As administering justice. Which is the justification of nearly every Klan and racist mob attack in history. The justification of the Atlanta attack in 1906.\n\n\nOpinion | Here are the people Trump is trying to delete\n\nhttps://wapo.st/3Hs6XZb\n(Sexism too)\n\nAbout 80 percent of the erased images contained one or more targeted keywords, such as gay, transgender, women, Hispanic and Black.\n\n\nEntire demographics are being scrubbed from records of both America’s past and present — including people of color, transgender people, women, immigrants and people with disabilities. They are now among America’s “missing persons.”\n\n\nPeople who aren’t White are an especially frequent target of government erasure.\n\n\nWomen (alongside racial minorities) have been disproportionately fired in purges of National Institutes of Health science review boards and senior military leadership positions. A landmark study on women’s health — the Women’s Health Initiative — was canceled entirely in April, though eventually restored after significant public outcry. The Labor Department likewise canceled grants for women’s apprenticeship programs last week.\n\n\nMore broadly, the terms “woman” and “women” have also appeared on banned-word lists for federal agency websites, grant applications and other external communications, including at the National Science Foundation and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttacks on Chinese Students Could Wreak Havoc on Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/05/30/trump-targets-chinese-students-harsh-blow-higher\n\nThe targeting of students in “critical fields” in particular could devastate STEM programs and research labs at smaller universities across the country, where Chinese international students are heavily represented. Rubio did not clarify what fields could be considered critical, potentially setting the stage for a sweeping focus on areas where GOP lawmakers have raised concerns about sensitive national security research being shared with the Chinese government.\n\n\nAt a press conference yesterday, department spokesperson Tammy Bruce declined to “get into the details” of how the new visa scrutiny would be applied or what “critical fields” the department was referring to, because it “might give up our hand and make certain things less effective.”\n\n\n“‘Aggressively revoking’ visas based on political ideology is a gross violation of basic free expression principles that anchor the academy,” he [Jonathan Friedman, managing director of U.S. free expression at PEN America] wrote to Inside Higher Ed.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/colleges-across-u-s-fear-chill-on-enrollments-of-foreign-students\n\nThe visa-interview suspension capped a week of bad news: The nominee to oversee the student-visa system vowed to end work authorization for recent international graduates, a move that could seriously dent the appeal of American colleges. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned foreign students who had not updated their employment records that they could face deportation. And the Trump administration took the unprecedented step of revoking Harvard University’s authority to enroll international students as part of an all-fronts showdown with one of the nation’s most prestigious institutions. Other colleges could be next, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in announcing the decision: “Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country.”\n\n\nTrump administration claims Chinese students ‘exploit’ U.S. universities\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/01/china-us-students-national-security-threat/\n\nWhat the New Travel Ban Means for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-the-new-travel-ban-means-for-higher-ed\n\nAnd taken together, the two proclamations underscore the extent to which international students are simultaneously in the crosshairs of two of the most contentious and virulent issues of the Trump presidency, its opposition to immigration and its fight to force higher education to bend to government’s agenda.\n\n\nRestrictions on international students are a powerful lever to use against colleges, many of which have come to rely on the higher tuition paid by foreign students in a time of leaner budgets and domestic demographic declines. At the graduate level, visa holders are the backbone of American research and science.\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Ends In-State Tuition for Undocumented Students\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/05/texas-ends-state-tuition-undocumented-students\n\nThousands of undocumented students in Texas no longer have access to in-state tuition. The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state on Wednesday over its policy of allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at public universities. Within hours, Texas sided with the Justice Department, and U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor granted a permanent injunction, quashing the policy.\n\n\nIn an interview before the permanent injunction, Ahilan Arulanantham, professor from practice at the UCLA School of Law and co-director of the law school’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said he didn’t believe a legal ruling in the Justice Department’s favor would necessarily affect other states, such as California, with similar laws. He said Texas used a residency criterion to decide eligibility for in-state tuition, an approach more vulnerable to legal challenges than some of the criteria other states use.\n\n\nBut even if other states go unscathed, losing in-state tuition benefits is “extraordinarily significant” for the “massive” undocumented population in Texas, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCUNY advocates push for $100M to bridge funding gap and enhance student services\n\nhttps://www.citizenportal.ai/articles/3326181/New-York/CUNY-advocates-push-for-100M-to-bridge-funding-gap-and-enhance-student-services\n(Thanks BE)\n\nScientific Community Fears for Future of STEM Workforce Amid NSF Overhaul\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/05/30/future-stem-workforce-jeopardy-amid-nsf-overhaul\n\nOf the approximately 1,500 grants the agency recently terminated, at least 750 came from the NSF’s education directorate, according to Grant Watch, an independent website that tracks terminated NSF grants. And that’s not the only shake-up happening at the NSF, which Congress created in 1950 to “promote the progress of science; advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; and secure the national defense.” The Trump administration has also laid off staff and proposed slashing the agency’s budget.\n\n\nAdditionally, NSF announced new priorities that include not funding projects aimed at recruiting more Americans from underrepresented backgrounds to the STEM workforce—a key focus for the agency historically.\n\n\nThe Trump administration says all these changes are part of its plan to reform the NSF, correct an alleged “scientific slowdown,” build a “a robust domestic STEM workforce” and “rapidly accelerate its investment in critical and advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology.” The NSF sends billions to colleges and universities to support STEM education and nonmedical scientific research.\n\n\nNYTimes: White House Unveils New Details of Stark Budget Cuts\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/white-house-budget-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe White House budget is not a matter of law. Ultimately, it is up to Congress to determine the budget, and in recent years it has routinely discarded many of the president’s proposals. Lawmakers are only starting to embark on the annual process, with government funding set to expire at the end of September.\n\n\nTargeting the Education Department, the president again put forward a roughly $12 billion cut, seeking to eliminate dozens of programs while unveiling new changes to Pell grants, which help low-income students pay for college.\n\n\nThe maximum award would be capped at $5,710 for the 2026-7 award year, a decrease of more than $1,600.\n\n\nMr. Trump and his budget director, Russell T. Vought, “are clearly hiding their policy goals, because they would hurt the middle class, the working class and the vulnerable,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, who leads her party on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\n\nNew Details of Trump’s Budget Cuts Alarm Researchers\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/03/new-details-trumps-budget-cuts-alarm-researchers\n\nTrump Wants Grant Makers to Become Political Appointees\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/05/trump-policy-moves-make-grant-makers-political\n\nOfficials say the policy, which would make it easier to fire thousands of government employees, is designed to increase accountability. But experts say it would increase corruption and threaten the nation’s health and economy.\n\n\nIn April, the Office of Personnel Management posted to the Federal Register a proposed rule “to increase career employee accountability” by allowing agencies to quickly remove from critical positions employees “who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.” That could include any employee with “substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking,” such as those involved in drafting funding opportunity announcements, evaluating grant applications and recommending or selecting grant recipients.\n\n\n\n\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION FY 2026 Budget Request to Congress\n\nhttps://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/00-NSF-FY26-CJ-Entire-Rollup.pdf\n\n(NSF PROGRAMS TO BROADEN PARTICIPATION (BP)) Total, Broadening Participation Programs FY24 appropriated: $1,613.85M FY26 (Request) $171.31M\n\n(That’s 10.6 percent of the good old days.

But in the case of Fulbright, the administration is acting unilaterally to nix awards for both American and foreign applicants that for decades have been selected jointly, effectively telling other countries that they don’t have final say in the spending of their own funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Dems Grill Trump’s Pick to Lead the Office for Civil Rights\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/sex-gender/2025/06/06/senate-dems-grill-trumps-pick-lead-civil-rights-office\n\n“This administration has fired more than half of the staff at OCR, and President Trump is now asking, in his budget, to slash that by $49 million next year, so explain to me how those firings and that funding cut will help reduce that backlog? I want to understand how you’re going to square that circle,” Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, asked early on in the hearing.\n\n\nRichey is currently senior chancellor for the Florida Department of Education and has twice served in OCR before, including a brief stint as acting secretary of civil rights at the end of Trump’s first term and the beginning of Biden’s presidency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House convenes meeting to brainstorm new Harvard measures - POLITICO\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/30/white-house-convenes-meeting-to-brainstorm-new-harvard-measures-00376782\n\nBut with the low-hanging policy options already underway, the administration knows it will need to get more creative to keep squeezing the school, according to two administration officials and another person familiar with the talks, who like others in the story were granted anonymity to share details of private conversations.\n\n(Quoth AI: In “The Sopranos,” “squeeze” generally refers to a tactic used by Tony Soprano and his associates to financially strain or control an individual or business, often through extortion or manipulation. )\n\nNYTimes: A Stephen Miller Staffer and Tough Talk: Inside Trump’s Latest Attack on Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/politics/harvard-law-review-investigation-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Justice Department opened an investigation into the student-run Harvard Law Review. The startling accusations show how the Trump administration is wielding power in pursuit of its political agenda.\n\n\nIn a series of letters that have not been previously reported, the government also disclosed that it had a “cooperating witness” inside the student-run journal. That witness now works in the White House under Stephen Miller, the architect of the administration’s domestic policy agenda, Trump officials confirmed.\n\n\nBut the aggressive language in the letters from the Justice Department’s two top civil rights lawyers appeared to have overstated the allegations in pursuit of an additional way to punish Harvard. In that way, the episode fits a broader trend in how the administration is wielding federal investigatory powers to impose its political agenda.\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Argues Cutting Off Its Government Funding Is Wasteful\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/harvard-argues-cutting-off-its-government-funding-is-wasteful.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn a court filing on Monday, Harvard University painted a bleak picture for its research enterprise if the funding taken away by the Trump administration is not restored.\n\n\n“The harm would be severe and long lasting,” John H. Shaw, the university’s vice provost for research, wrote in the 17-page declaration that is part of Harvard’s lawsuit against the Trump administration. “Money cannot repair the lost time, talent, and opportunity.”\n\n\nENHANCING NATIONAL SECURITY BY ADDRESSING RISKS AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/enhancing-national-security-by-addressing-risks-at-harvard-university/\n\nA PROCLAMATION\n\n\nCrime rates at Harvard University — including violent crime rates — have drastically risen in recent years. Harvard has failed to discipline at least some categories of conduct violations on campus. Given these facts, it is imperative, in my judgment, that the Federal Government be able to assess and, if necessary, address misconduct and crimes committed by foreign students at Harvard.\n\n(Believe the Clery reports and you won’t conclude the same: https://www.hupd.harvard.edu/sites/g/files/omnuum2276/files/2024-10/2024%20Annual%20Security%20Report%20Cambridge%20Campus%20Clery%20Act%20Criminal%20Statistics_0.pdf)\n\nThese concerns have compelled the Federal Government to conclude that Harvard University is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student and exchange visitor programs.\n\n\nConsidering these facts [sp? ed.], I have determined that it is necessary to restrict the entry of foreign nationals who seek to enter the United States solely or principally to participate in a course of study at Harvard University or in an exchange visitor program hosted by Harvard University.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Pushes to Restrict Harvard’s International Students From Entering U.S.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-student-visas.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nTrump proclamation seeks to restrict international students from Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/04/harvard-visa-ban-trump-international-students/\n\nPresident Trump suspended Harvard from participating in the student-visa program, effectively prohibiting foreign nationals from attending the nation’s most prominent university\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-issues-proclamation-suspending-foreign-students-at-harvard-e62859c4?st=oJDxth&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nMOTION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER\n\nhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.285083/gov.uscourts.mad.285083.56.0.pdf\n\nThis suit challenges the government’s continuing unlawful and retaliatory actions to bar Harvard University from hosting international students and scholars.\n\n\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER\n\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25964963-harvardtrotwo060525/\n\nFor purposes of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b), the President and Fellows ofHarvard College (“Plaintiff”) has made a sufficient showing that it has provided notice toDefendants Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, Immigration and CustomsEnforcement, Todd Lyons, Department of Justice, Pamela Bondi, Student and Exchange VisitorProgram, Jim Hicks, Department of State, and Marco Rubio (collectively, “Defendants”) and that,unless its Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”), [ECF No. 56 (the “Motion”)],is granted, it will sustain immediate and irreparable injury before there is an opportunity to hearfrom all parties.\n\n\nNYTimes: Judge Temporarily Blocks Trump’s Order Curtailing Foreign Students at Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/us/harvard-response-trump-international-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\nTrump Escalates Attack on Columbia University by Threatening Its Accreditation - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/nyregion/columbia-trump-accreditation-civil-rights.html\n(Damned if you do, damned if you don’t)\n\nThe federal Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, which two weeks ago found that Columbia violated civil rights laws by “acting with deliberate indifference” toward the harassment of Jewish students, sent a letter on Wednesday to the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the nongovernmental organization that accredits Columbia.\n\n\nThe letter said that because Columbia was in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws, the Education Department believes it fails to meet the standards for accreditation.\n\n\n“University accreditors have an obligation to ensure member institutions abide by their standards,” Linda McMahon, the federal education secretary, said in a news release. She said the government looked forward to being “fully informed of actions taken to ensure Columbia’s compliance with accreditation standards, including compliance with federal civil rights laws.”\n\n\nPresident Trump has described the accreditation process as his “secret weapon” to force ideological changes at universities. But the Trump administration does not have direct control over which universities are accredited. Instead, those decisions are made by nongovernmental organizations certified by the government, in a complex process meant to insulate universities from political interference.\n\n\nNo, Trump Is Not Pulling Columbia’s Accreditation. Here’s What You Need to Know.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/no-trump-is-not-pulling-columbias-accreditation-heres-what-you-need-to-know\n\nIn terms of individual colleges, the federal government has no direct authority to interpret an accreditor’s standards, said John R. Przypyszny, a lawyer who specializes in accreditation. So Trump alone can’t revoke Columbia’s accreditation, which would cut off access to federal financial aid.\n\n\nThe Education Department’s letter, sent Wednesday, argued that Columbia has violated the standards of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.\n\n\nBecause Columbia failed to adequately respond to antisemitic behavior during protests against the war in Gaza, the department’s Office for Civil Rights concluded last month, the institution has violated Title VI, which bars discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared Jewish ancestry. Therefore, the letter continues, Columbia “fails to meet the standards for accreditation,” the department said in a news release. In light of that, the department said, the Middle States Commission must require the university to “establish a plan to come into compliance.”\n\n\nNYTimes: To Bolster Columbia Inquiry, Prosecutor Likened Hamas Graffiti to Cross Burning\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/columbia-protester-hamas-cross.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Justice Department, intent on pursuing a criminal case against student protesters at Columbia University, argued that graffiti with a Hamas symbol outside the home of the school’s interim president threatened her life and was comparable to a racist cross burning, newly unsealed court documents show.\n\n\nThe photo showed graffiti in bright red paint on the building where the university president lived, with the words “free them all” and an inverted triangle.\n\n(How freeing protestors becomes pro-Hamas, I’ll leave for others, but the article mentions an accompanying instagram post.)\n\nThe records also underscore how determined the Trump administration was to press forward with a case judges viewed as weak. Justice Department leaders pushed for an investigation of a student group, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, but federal judges in New York rejected the administration’s efforts to get a search warrant four times, in what some veteran lawyers described as an unusually prolonged disagreement between federal prosecutors and the courts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is saw on bluesky this week\n\n\nIndiana’s governor fired all the elected members of Indiana University’s Board of Trustees.

Faculty were downgraded to “advisory only” roles in university decision-making. Degree programs that graduated too few students would be closed.\n\n\nAnd at Indiana University, whose flagship campus in Bloomington is ranked among the nation’s top 100 schools, the state’s governor was given new power over the school’s governing board.\n\n\nThe moves align with a conservative playbook to reduce faculty power on campuses perceived by many on the right as bastions of liberal thought. This year, several other Republican-led states passed laws requiring reviews for tenured faculty and the reorganization of programs at public institutions that have low enrollment.\n\n\nMany faculty members see the Indiana bill as an attack on their university’s independence and part of an effort to restrict their own freedom to teach and speak. They read Dr. Whitten’s [President of Indiana University] silence as support for the changes.\n\n\nIndiana’s experience has been emblematic of the pressures facing public universities. But several factors — an active protest movement on campus, a state with strong conservative leanings and Dr. Whitten herself, a leader at odds with many on her campus — have created especially tense conditions.\n\n\nDr. Whitten’s administration acted almost immediately. The university called in the Indiana State Police, which stationed snipers on rooftops and arrested 57 people, including a handful of faculty members.\n\n(Snipers!!!)\n\nDr. Whitten and the faculty have long had a frosty relationship. Earlier that spring, more than 800 faculty member approved a vote of no confidence in Dr. Whitten.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s letter announcing this move also doubled as a request for documents, instructing Harvard to deliver five years of video or audio of “any protest activity involving a non-immigrant student,” plus disciplinary files, before the ban will be reconsidered.

At his 100-day rally in Michigan, Donald Trump declared, “We’ve just gotten started. You haven’t even seen anything yet.” Christopher Rufo, architect of the right-wing culture war, promises to plunge higher education still further into “an existential terror.”\n\n\nWe should be prepared for a potential wave of coordinated assaults on higher education this summer: reductions in Pell Grant eligibility for low-income students and slashed student loans, more dismantlement of scientific research funding, politicized accreditation crackdowns, new endowment taxes, expanded intimidation of international students and scholars, and further weaponization of Title VI and Title IX enforcement.\n\n\nWe recommend mobilizing on two simultaneous fronts this summer: by operationalizing mutual academic defense compacts (MADCs), and through direct activism. We must forge powerful alliances for mass protest. We suggest one often-overlooked but deeply strategic constituency— veterans.",

    "text": "Academia’s Holy Warriors\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/academias-holy-warriors/\n\nThe idea is central to Deneen’s [Notre Dame political-science professor] argument in Why Liberalism Failed, which announces America’s failed — past tense — liberal tradition. For Deneen, “liberalism” refers not just to the political beliefs of self-identified liberals or progressives, but also to the broader, rights-based political philosophy that has guided both major political parties for most of American history.\n\n\nAs Deneen was speaking, blueberry pie was served to an audience that included Rod Dreher, the well-known American Conservative blogger and author of The Benedict Option; Matthew Schmitz, an editor of the ecumenical religious journal First Things; and Bria Sandford, editorial director of Penguin’s right-of-center Sentinel book division. The next morning, the New York Times columnist Ross Douthat arrived\n\n\nIn the year and a half since the conference, other writers who have staked out public positions on the nonliberal right include the Harvard law professor Adrian Vermeule, the First Things editor R.R. Reno, the former Washington Examiner managing editor Helen Andrews, and the University of Dallas assistant professor of political science — and deputy editor of the journal American Affairs — Gladden Pappin. One might add Mary Ann Glendon, the Harvard law professor and former ambassador to the Vatican, who in July was named the head of President Trump’s Commission on Unalienable Rights.\n\n\nThe radicals, on the other hand, were those who believed that American liberalism had always been deeply hostile to the core values of Catholics.\n\n\nHarvard Law professor Adrian Vermeule accused Deneen of failing to grapple fully with the consequences of his own diagnosis. … What was needed was not the creation of new societies — which would survive only at the forbearance of the reigning powers — but a coup against the liberal “imperium” from within. … Rather than withdrawing from the power centers of liberal society, Vermeule recommends that administrators and other elites find a “strategic position” from which, as dissatisfaction with liberalism grows, they can turn that bureaucracy to “new ends.”\n\n(Deenan also raises the ire of David Brooks:)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/opinion/trump-vance-morality.html\n\nParks, libraries, museums: here’s why Trump is attacking America’s best-loved institutions | Margaret Sullivan | The Guardian\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/02/national-parks-libraries-museums-trump\n\nIt seems counterintuitive, but this is all a part of a broad plan that the great 20th-century political thinker Hannah Arendt would have understood all too well.\n\n\nTake away natural beauty, free access to books and support for the arts, and you end up with a less enlightened, more ignorant and less engaged public. That’s a public much more easily manipulated.\n\n\n“A people that can no longer believe in anything cannot make up its mind,” said Arendt, a student of authoritarianism, in 1973. Eventually, such a public “is deprived … of its ability to think and judge”, and with people like that, “you can then do what you please”.",

The laws mandate that students take civics courses focused on Western civilization and bar classes centered on race or gender from counting toward core requirements.\n\n\nState lawmakers have the authority to regulate curriculums and set requirements for graduation, but higher education experts say that until recently, they have let public colleges and universities lead the way. That began to change in 2020 after the first Trump administration issued an executive order to stamp out “divisive concepts” about race and gender in the federal government, according to the American Association of University Professors and American Federation of Teachers.\n\n\n“This is a new type of local intervention,” said Keith E. Whittington, founding chair of the Academic Committee of the Academic Freedom Alliance. “Some of the proposals are making more elaborate interventions about what the curriculum ought to look like and are also increasingly interested in the content.”\n\n\nHouse Democrats Air Grievances With McMahon\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/05/mcmahon-faces-angry-house-democrats\n\nThe Trump administration has recently criticized what it sees as a lack of viewpoint diversity at Harvard University and demanded that the institution hire more conservative professors if it would like to regain access to federal grant funding. At a Senate hearing Tuesday, McMahon said a federal law that prevents discrimination based on race and national origin gave the department the authority to make such demands.\n\n\nTakano [California Democrat] snapped back, saying, “I think it’s pretty clear you haven’t thought through this idea of viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\nNYTimes: A Professor Was Fired for Her Politics. Is That the Future of Academia?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/magazine/academic-freedom-politics.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut that night, reading Kanazi’s words while taking in the news, she felt a pitch of fury and despair at the rising number of dead in Gaza and her sense that too few Americans were similarly horrified. She believed in her right to state her beliefs and share those of others, like Kanazi, with whom she sympathized. Besides, the post would disappear from her Instagram stories by the following evening.\n\n\nTwo days later, on a Friday, Finkelstein got an email from Jennifer Storm, the director of equity and Title IX at Muhlenberg, asking her to come to a meeting the following Monday — with a lawyer if she wanted one.\n\n\nBut the meeting, which took place a week later on Zoom with Finkelstein’s lawyer present, was entirely about her repost. Finkelstein was told not to return to campus and locked out of her email. Her classes would be reassigned to an adjunct professor while the college hired an outside firm to investigate.\n\n\nThe investigation stretched over the spring semester. Then, in May, Finkelstein received a new letter from the college: She was being fired, with cause. This despite her having tenure, a historic form of academic job protection meant to insulate scholars from the steamrolling power of both politics and public opinion. Less noticed at the time, but arguably more prophetic, was how the mechanics of her firing trammeled yet another longtime standard in the academy, that of professors’ deciding among themselves when and if a colleague should be fired.",

Then He Got in Trouble.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/brown-university-newspaper-musk-doge.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThousands of administrative employees at Brown University woke up this spring to an email with pointed Elon Musk-like questions about their job responsibilities.\n\n\nPlease describe your role, it asked. What tasks have you performed in the past week? How would Brown students be affected if your job didn’t exist?\n\n\nThe March 18 email was from a sophomore, Alex Shieh, who explained that the responses would be included in a story for The Brown Spectator, a new, as yet unpublished conservative newspaper on campus.\n\n\nTwo days later, Brown notified Mr. Shieh that he was under investigation for possible violations of the university’s code of student conduct, including its prohibitions on invasion of privacy, misrepresentation and emotional or psychological harm.\n\n\nWith that, his case — and that of two Spectator students who were later placed under investigation — became the latest flashpoint in the free speech wars on American college campuses.\n\n\nBrown eventually cleared all three students of wrongdoing. But their case is yet another example of how universities continue to struggle with protecting the rights of students to express themselves on campus, after years of trying to adjudicate just when political expression tips into harassment.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Attacks on Black History Betray America\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/opinion/black-history-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration’s framing of Black history as “D.E.I.” — and “D.E.I.” as harming white Americans — recasts its attack on Black history as protecting white Americans. As administering justice. Which is the justification of nearly every Klan and racist mob attack in history. The justification of the Atlanta attack in 1906.\n\n\nOpinion | Here are the people Trump is trying to delete\n\nhttps://wapo.st/3Hs6XZb\n(Sexism too)\n\nAbout 80 percent of the erased images contained one or more targeted keywords, such as gay, transgender, women, Hispanic and Black.\n\n\nEntire demographics are being scrubbed from records of both America’s past and present — including people of color, transgender people, women, immigrants and people with disabilities. They are now among America’s “missing persons.”\n\n\nPeople who aren’t White are an especially frequent target of government erasure.\n\n\nWomen (alongside racial minorities) have been disproportionately fired in purges of National Institutes of Health science review boards and senior military leadership positions. A landmark study on women’s health — the Women’s Health Initiative — was canceled entirely in April, though eventually restored after significant public outcry. The Labor Department likewise canceled grants for women’s apprenticeship programs last week.\n\n\nMore broadly, the terms “woman” and “women” have also appeared on banned-word lists for federal agency websites, grant applications and other external communications, including at the National Science Foundation and the Food and Drug Administration.",

Rubio did not clarify what fields could be considered critical, potentially setting the stage for a sweeping focus on areas where GOP lawmakers have raised concerns about sensitive national security research being shared with the Chinese government.\n\n\nAt a press conference yesterday, department spokesperson Tammy Bruce declined to “get into the details” of how the new visa scrutiny would be applied or what “critical fields” the department was referring to, because it “might give up our hand and make certain things less effective.”\n\n\n“‘Aggressively revoking’ visas based on political ideology is a gross violation of basic free expression principles that anchor the academy,” he [Jonathan Friedman, managing director of U.S. free expression at PEN America] wrote to Inside Higher Ed.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/colleges-across-u-s-fear-chill-on-enrollments-of-foreign-students\n\nThe visa-interview suspension capped a week of bad news: The nominee to oversee the student-visa system vowed to end work authorization for recent international graduates, a move that could seriously dent the appeal of American colleges. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned foreign students who had not updated their employment records that they could face deportation. And the Trump administration took the unprecedented step of revoking Harvard University’s authority to enroll international students as part of an all-fronts showdown with one of the nation’s most prestigious institutions. Other colleges could be next, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in announcing the decision: “Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country.”\n\n\nTrump administration claims Chinese students ‘exploit’ U.S. universities\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/01/china-us-students-national-security-threat/\n\nWhat the New Travel Ban Means for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-the-new-travel-ban-means-for-higher-ed\n\nAnd taken together, the two proclamations underscore the extent to which international students are simultaneously in the crosshairs of two of the most contentious and virulent issues of the Trump presidency, its opposition to immigration and its fight to force higher education to bend to government’s agenda.\n\n\nRestrictions on international students are a powerful lever to use against colleges, many of which have come to rely on the higher tuition paid by foreign students in a time of leaner budgets and domestic demographic declines. At the graduate level, visa holders are the backbone of American research and science.",

The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state on Wednesday over its policy of allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at public universities. Within hours, Texas sided with the Justice Department, and U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor granted a permanent injunction, quashing the policy.\n\n\nIn an interview before the permanent injunction, Ahilan Arulanantham, professor from practice at the UCLA School of Law and co-director of the law school’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said he didn’t believe a legal ruling in the Justice Department’s favor would necessarily affect other states, such as California, with similar laws. He said Texas used a residency criterion to decide eligibility for in-state tuition, an approach more vulnerable to legal challenges than some of the criteria other states use.\n\n\nBut even if other states go unscathed, losing in-state tuition benefits is “extraordinarily significant” for the “massive” undocumented population in Texas, he said.",

And that’s not the only shake-up happening at the NSF, which Congress created in 1950 to “promote the progress of science; advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; and secure the national defense.” The Trump administration has also laid off staff and proposed slashing the agency’s budget.\n\n\nAdditionally, NSF announced new priorities that include not funding projects aimed at recruiting more Americans from underrepresented backgrounds to the STEM workforce—a key focus for the agency historically.\n\n\nThe Trump administration says all these changes are part of its plan to reform the NSF, correct an alleged “scientific slowdown,” build a “a robust domestic STEM workforce” and “rapidly accelerate its investment in critical and advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology.” The NSF sends billions to colleges and universities to support STEM education and nonmedical scientific research.\n\n\nNYTimes: White House Unveils New Details of Stark Budget Cuts\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/white-house-budget-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe White House budget is not a matter of law. Ultimately, it is up to Congress to determine the budget, and in recent years it has routinely discarded many of the president’s proposals. Lawmakers are only starting to embark on the annual process, with government funding set to expire at the end of September.\n\n\nTargeting the Education Department, the president again put forward a roughly $12 billion cut, seeking to eliminate dozens of programs while unveiling new changes to Pell grants, which help low-income students pay for college.\n\n\nThe maximum award would be capped at $5,710 for the 2026-7 award year, a decrease of more than $1,600.\n\n\nMr. Trump and his budget director, Russell T. Vought, “are clearly hiding their policy goals, because they would hurt the middle class, the working class and the vulnerable,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, who leads her party on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\n\nNew Details of Trump’s Budget Cuts Alarm Researchers\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/03/new-details-trumps-budget-cuts-alarm-researchers\n\nTrump Wants Grant Makers to Become Political Appointees\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/05/trump-policy-moves-make-grant-makers-political\n\nOfficials say the policy, which would make it easier to fire thousands of government employees, is designed to increase accountability. But experts say it would increase corruption and threaten the nation’s health and economy.\n\n\nIn April, the Office of Personnel Management posted to the Federal Register a proposed rule “to increase career employee accountability” by allowing agencies to quickly remove from critical positions employees “who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.” That could include any employee with “substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking,” such as those involved in drafting funding opportunity announcements, evaluating grant applications and recommending or selecting grant recipients.\n\n\n\n\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION FY 2026 Budget Request to Congress\n\nhttps://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/00-NSF-FY26-CJ-Entire-Rollup.pdf\n\n(NSF PROGRAMS TO BROADEN PARTICIPATION (BP)) Total, Broadening Participation Programs FY24 appropriated: $1,613.85M FY26 (Request) $171.31M\n\n(That’s 10.6 percent of the good old days.

Given these facts, it is imperative, in my judgment, that the Federal Government be able to assess and, if necessary, address misconduct and crimes committed by foreign students at Harvard.\n\n(Believe the Clery reports and you won’t conclude the same: https://www.hupd.harvard.edu/sites/g/files/omnuum2276/files/2024-10/2024%20Annual%20Security%20Report%20Cambridge%20Campus%20Clery%20Act%20Criminal%20Statistics_0.pdf)\n\nThese concerns have compelled the Federal Government to conclude that Harvard University is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student and exchange visitor programs.\n\n\nConsidering these facts [sp? ed.], I have determined that it is necessary to restrict the entry of foreign nationals who seek to enter the United States solely or principally to participate in a course of study at Harvard University or in an exchange visitor program hosted by Harvard University.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Pushes to Restrict Harvard’s International Students From Entering U.S.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-student-visas.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nTrump proclamation seeks to restrict international students from Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/04/harvard-visa-ban-trump-international-students/\n\nPresident Trump suspended Harvard from participating in the student-visa program, effectively prohibiting foreign nationals from attending the nation’s most prominent university\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-issues-proclamation-suspending-foreign-students-at-harvard-e62859c4?st=oJDxth&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nMOTION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER\n\nhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.285083/gov.uscourts.mad.285083.56.0.pdf\n\nThis suit challenges the government’s continuing unlawful and retaliatory actions to bar Harvard University from hosting international students and scholars.\n\n\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER\n\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25964963-harvardtrotwo060525/\n\nFor purposes of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b), the President and Fellows ofHarvard College (“Plaintiff”) has made a sufficient showing that it has provided notice toDefendants Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, Immigration and CustomsEnforcement, Todd Lyons, Department of Justice, Pamela Bondi, Student and Exchange VisitorProgram, Jim Hicks, Department of State, and Marco Rubio (collectively, “Defendants”) and that,unless its Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”), [ECF No. 56 (the “Motion”)],is granted, it will sustain immediate and irreparable injury before there is an opportunity to hearfrom all parties.\n\n\nNYTimes: Judge Temporarily Blocks Trump’s Order Curtailing Foreign Students at Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/us/harvard-response-trump-international-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\nTrump Escalates Attack on Columbia University by Threatening Its Accreditation - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/nyregion/columbia-trump-accreditation-civil-rights.html\n(Damned if you do, damned if you don’t)\n\nThe federal Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, which two weeks ago found that Columbia violated civil rights laws by “acting with deliberate indifference” toward the harassment of Jewish students, sent a letter on Wednesday to the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the nongovernmental organization that accredits Columbia.\n\n\nThe letter said that because Columbia was in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws, the Education Department believes it fails to meet the standards for accreditation.\n\n\n“University accreditors have an obligation to ensure member institutions abide by their standards,” Linda McMahon, the federal education secretary, said in a news release. She said the government looked forward to being “fully informed of actions taken to ensure Columbia’s compliance with accreditation standards, including compliance with federal civil rights laws.”\n\n\nPresident Trump has described the accreditation process as his “secret weapon” to force ideological changes at universities. But the Trump administration does not have direct control over which universities are accredited. Instead, those decisions are made by nongovernmental organizations certified by the government, in a complex process meant to insulate universities from political interference.\n\n\nNo, Trump Is Not Pulling Columbia’s Accreditation. Here’s What You Need to Know.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/no-trump-is-not-pulling-columbias-accreditation-heres-what-you-need-to-know\n\nIn terms of individual colleges, the federal government has no direct authority to interpret an accreditor’s standards, said John R. Przypyszny, a lawyer who specializes in accreditation. So Trump alone can’t revoke Columbia’s accreditation, which would cut off access to federal financial aid.\n\n\nThe Education Department’s letter, sent Wednesday, argued that Columbia has violated the standards of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.\n\n\nBecause Columbia failed to adequately respond to antisemitic behavior during protests against the war in Gaza, the department’s Office for Civil Rights concluded last month, the institution has violated Title VI, which bars discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared Jewish ancestry. Therefore, the letter continues, Columbia “fails to meet the standards for accreditation,” the department said in a news release. In light of that, the department said, the Middle States Commission must require the university to “establish a plan to come into compliance.”\n\n\nNYTimes: To Bolster Columbia Inquiry, Prosecutor Likened Hamas Graffiti to Cross Burning\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/columbia-protester-hamas-cross.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Justice Department, intent on pursuing a criminal case against student protesters at Columbia University, argued that graffiti with a Hamas symbol outside the home of the school’s interim president threatened her life and was comparable to a racist cross burning, newly unsealed court documents show.\n\n\nThe photo showed graffiti in bright red paint on the building where the university president lived, with the words “free them all” and an inverted triangle.\n\n(How freeing protestors becomes pro-Hamas, I’ll leave for others, but the article mentions an accompanying instagram post.)\n\nThe records also underscore how determined the Trump administration was to press forward with a case judges viewed as weak. Justice Department leaders pushed for an investigation of a student group, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, but federal judges in New York rejected the administration’s efforts to get a search warrant four times, in what some veteran lawyers described as an unusually prolonged disagreement between federal prosecutors and the courts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is saw on bluesky this week\n\n\nIndiana’s governor fired all the elected members of Indiana University’s Board of Trustees.

Faculty were downgraded to “advisory only” roles in university decision-making. Degree programs that graduated too few students would be closed.\n\n\nAnd at Indiana University, whose flagship campus in Bloomington is ranked among the nation’s top 100 schools, the state’s governor was given new power over the school’s governing board.\n\n\nThe moves align with a conservative playbook to reduce faculty power on campuses perceived by many on the right as bastions of liberal thought. This year, several other Republican-led states passed laws requiring reviews for tenured faculty and the reorganization of programs at public institutions that have low enrollment.\n\n\nMany faculty members see the Indiana bill as an attack on their university’s independence and part of an effort to restrict their own freedom to teach and speak. They read Dr. Whitten’s [President of Indiana University] silence as support for the changes.\n\n\nIndiana’s experience has been emblematic of the pressures facing public universities. But several factors — an active protest movement on campus, a state with strong conservative leanings and Dr. Whitten herself, a leader at odds with many on her campus — have created especially tense conditions.\n\n\nDr. Whitten’s administration acted almost immediately. The university called in the Indiana State Police, which stationed snipers on rooftops and arrested 57 people, including a handful of faculty members.\n\n(Snipers!!!)\n\nDr. Whitten and the faculty have long had a frosty relationship. Earlier that spring, more than 800 faculty member approved a vote of no confidence in Dr. Whitten. (More than 3,000 were eligible to vote.)\n\n(Just to be fair, only 948 showed up to be possibly counted https://www.idsnews.com/article/2024/04/behind-the-vote-faculty-lost-confidence-whitten-administration)\n\n\n\n\nUniversities quietly negotiating with White House aide to try to avoid Harvard’s fate, source says | CNN Politics\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/politics/universities-negotiate-trump-administration-harvard\n(So says an anonymous source likely named Stephen Miller)\n\nCollege and university leaders have been privately negotiating with a deputy to top Trump aide Stephen Miller in hopes of avoiding the same aggressive targeting of Harvard University, a person familiar with the matter said, as the administration looks to escalate its attacks on the Ivy League institution and other schools.",

There is no other logical explanation.\n\n(Well, the argument of destroying competing power bases is another explanation. If a sharpie can be used to rewrite truth without pesky pushback…)\n\nThe EU is licking its chops over this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. According to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, while on stage at Sorbonne University, the EU Executive Branch has already decided to set up a “super grant” program, aimed at “longer-term perspective to the very best in the field.”\n\n\nthe Commission is authorizing additional funding of $566 million in 2025-2027, making Europe “a magnet for researchers.” This funding is in addition to the European Research Council’s budget of $18 billion for 2021-2027. Moreover, the EU will “enshrine freedom of scientific research into law” via a new enactment. Europe will not compromise on its long-standing principles of academic freedom.\n\n\n“The administration has issued a multi-pronged, anti-science attack on the health sciences.

It informed the organizers of a Danish lecture series — one I was soon scheduled to speak at — that the final portion of American funding would be released only after they signed a statement essentially saying they were in compliance with a U.S. executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n\nBefore the organizers at the University of Southern Denmark could respond, the U.S. State Department sent an even blunter message: The grant was “being terminated for the convenience of the U.S. government.” It concluded by thanking the Danes “for your partnering with the Department of State and God Bless America.”\n\n\nSecond, the cutoff of funding was followed nearly two weeks later by another message to the university. (I viewed copies of all the emails.) It said that a recent court hearing prevented the State Department from holding up congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds and ordered it to make the financing available. It further ordered the department to “provide written notice of this order” to recipients of grants. Notifying the Danish university was as far as the administration went in complying with the court. The remaining funds haven’t been released yet, organizers say — typical of the Trump administration’s defiance of the courts.\n\n\nAnother core element of freedom — indeed something essential to its survival — is that power must be limited; there have to be checks and balances not just within government but within society. I have long warned that the concentration of wealth among a small percentage of the population would provide a fertile field for a demagogue, and that there was an ample supply of people who might play the part.\n\n\nUniversities, which protect academic freedom, are as important to this system of checks and balances as other civil rights protections like freedom of the press.\n\n\nNYU Withholds Diploma Due to Pro-Palestinian Commencement Speech\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/16/nyu-withholds-diploma-due-pro-palestinian-grad-speech\n\nRozos spoke at the ceremony for the university’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study.

Yale’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is also investing $4 million to support graduate students who have lost training and research grants. Similarly, last month Johns Hopkins University announced that it is tapping earnings from its $13.2 billion endowment to give researchers $100,000 each for delayed grants, or $150,000 for terminated grants, during a 12-month period. And Northwestern University—which hasn’t received any grant payments from the National Institutes of Health since March—is offering faculty up to $50,000 to maintain projects for up to one year.\n\n(Hopefully CUNY will be providing some relief in this manner as well)\n\nOver the past several decades, universities have already substantially increased the amount of money they spend on their own research and development—from 10 percent of the total in 1970 to 25 percent in 2023, according to federal data. Meanwhile, federal support for academic research has been on the decline, falling from 71 percent to 55 percent during that same timeframe. And support from industry, charities and other sources have always been marginal, collectively making up about 15 percent of contributions to research funding at colleges and universities in 2023.\n\n\nWhile that won’t cover all of the terminated grants, “the bridge has to go somewhere,” he said, explaining that the program isn’t supporting projects that don’t have viable alternative long-term funding options. Instead, “we’re providing funding for projects where the faculty member has other sources of funding and other proposals with the same or different federal agencies,” Díaz de la Rubia said.

In Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, published as short stories in the late 1940s and as a novel in 1953, warned not only of the destruction of books, but of a society in which people had lost the desire to read them. The parallel today is not only the administration’s effort to destroy and suppress knowledge, but also the institution’s willingness to accept the cultivated irrelevance of it—a challenge that undermines any serious effort to conduct research, inform policy, or guide public institutions.\n\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF)—established as an independent agency through the National Science Act of 1950 and marking its 75th anniversary this week—traces its roots to Vannevar Bush’s landmark report, “Science, the Endless Frontier,” addressed to President Harry S. Truman. But we might also see the establishment of this premier research institution as reflecting a response to fears depicted by Bradbury. The NSF can be understood not only as a catalyst of scientific promise for national purpose, but also as a guarded response to fears about centralized control over knowledge and thought, shaped by the dark shadows of the Third Reich and the emerging Red Scare.\n\n\nLast week, as the Board held its 494th meeting, I listened to NSF staff say that DOGE had by fiat the authority to give thumbs up or down to grant applications which had been systematically vetted by layers of subject matter experts.\n\n\nOur closed-to-the-public deliberations were observed by Zachary Terrell from the DOGE team. Through his Zoom screen, Terrell showed more interest in his water bottle and his cuticles than in the discussion. According to Nature Terrell, listed as a “consultant” in the NSF directory, had accessed the NSF awards system to block the dispersal of approved grants. The message I received was that the National Science Board had a role to play in name only.\n\n\nAll of this is threatened by the creeping normalization of authoritarian approaches to knowledge management and academic freedom. The National Science Board has not been disbanded like so many other statutorily established, independent agencies in the federal government. But preservation of form provides little consolation when function has been strategically neutralized, mirroring the backsliding that scholars have thoroughly documented: maintaining legitimacy for institutions that no longer honor their founding purposes. This hollowing out is not just about governance in the abstract, it has material consequences for which research questions get asked, which datasets get produced, which knowledge gets produced, and which perspectives shape our understanding of pressing societal challenges. It has consequences for the integrity of knowledge itself.\n\n\nLast week, the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, was summarily dismissed via an email addressed to “Carla” from a White House HR administrator. The Trump Administration claimed that she was fired for “things she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.” It is true that Hayden was repeatedly on record as saying the Library should be for all Americans. And it is false that the Library, which is intended to hold all books published in the United States, lends books to children. The ouster of Hayden is part of a broader pattern of political targeting of women and Black public servants across the federal government.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Cancels Scores of Grants to Study Online Misinformation\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/trump-online-misinformation-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast month, the National Science Foundation, a government agency that finances much of the scientific research in the United States, began canceling hundreds of grants. Most focused on studies involving issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, but scores singled out work on online content.\n\n\nThe cancellation has jeopardized research in universities in virtually every state, leaving researchers scrambling to find funding for projects that in many cases are only partly completed.\n\n\nEach Friday since then, the foundation has announced new cancellations. It has now cut more than 1,400 grants, including 75 more last Friday. In all, the grants were worth more than $1 billion, according to a list compiled by two researchers, Scott W. Delaney, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health, and Noam Ross, the executive director of rOpenSci, a nonprofit software foundation. None of the grant abstracts reviewed by The New York Times called for censoring content.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Cuts Off Budding CUNY Scientists From Mentorship and Aid\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/05/14/cuny-urise-science-research-nih-trump/\n\nThe Trump administration has cut off support that has sustained a teaching model that for decades has been instrumental in catapulting students into careers as scientists.\n\n\nFunded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE) supports the pursuit of advanced degrees by students in the biomedical field, who are offered tuition assistance, mentorship, registration to professional conferences and, crucially, lab experience.\n\n\nNIH canceled all U-RISE funding at City College, Queens College, Brooklyn College, Lehman College and Medgar Evers College. … Professors who work with students in the program say the federal defunding will likely doom the program, and with it vital opportunities to conduct research while attending a public college — putting them on track for further academic research.\n\n\n“University leadership is working to support everyone in our community and will pursue every avenue available to sustain CUNY as a preeminent research institution,” wrote Noah Gardy.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEH Announces Grant Opportunity to Create Statues of Iconic Americans for the National Garden of American Heroes | National Endowment for the Humanities\n\nhttps://www.neh.gov/news/neh-announces-grant-opportunity-create-statues-iconic-americans-national-garden-american\n(This isn’t new, but still galling)\n\nThe NIH Is Requiring Grantees to Follow Trump’s Anti-Trans Executive Order\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-nih-is-requiring-grantees-to-follow-trumps-anti-trans-executive-order\n\nAnd she [researcher at a teaching hospital] learned that the grantee was expected to comply with the gender-equity law Title IX — “including the requirements set forth in Presidential Executive Order 14168 titled Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” That’s the executive order President Trump signed on the first day of his second term, directing the government to recognize two sexes, male and female.\n\n\nThe new policies apply to institutions that accept funds on scientists’ behalf, according to two lawyers who reviewed the language. So if a university accepts a grant with these terms, it could be at risk if the government considers anyone at that campus — not just the scientist spending the money — to be perpetuating “DEI” or “gender ideology extremism.”\n\n\nThe NIH reserves the right to “terminate financial assistance awards and recover all funds,” states its April 21 policy on diversity. And the term sheet citing the anti-transgender executive order states that payments “are predicated on compliance with the above requirements.” It says that violators can be held liable criminally as well as under the False Claims Act, the anti-government defraudment law.\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Association of American Universities, which represents research universities, said that the organization was aware of the language, but declined to comment further.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Nominates Iowa Regent to be Assistant Secretary of Postsecondary Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/12/trump-nominates-assistant-secretary-postsecondary-ed\n\n[David] Barker would focus on improving outcomes and accountability by reforming accreditation, improving federal student aid programs and ensuring grant programs match the Trump administration’s priorities.\n\n\nBarker was an Iowa regent for six years where he advanced cost control measures, promoted academic freedom and ended “discriminatory DEI programs,” according to the release.\n\n(On wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_R._Barker] we can read about what planet this guy lives on: “Barker is the author of Welcome to Free America, a book set in 2057 as a guide to immigrants coming to the former United States after the collapse of government.

The university, it alleged, had violated Title IX by allowing transgender female students in women’s restrooms, locker rooms, and dorm rooms.\n\n\nPayton McNabb, a former student whose complaints about WCU’s transgender policies brought conservative media attention to the university, said she didn’t experience WCU as quiet. She felt professors treated conservative students differently, and she was hurt by a university Title IX investigation into her conduct after she posted a video of herself asking a transgender woman why she was in a women’s bathroom on campus.\n\n\nThe emails that seem to have triggered the Department of Education’s investigation have been framed by Speech First [a group dedicated to protecting the expression of certain conservative stances at colleges] as evidence that WCU is deliberately defying President Donald Trump.\n\n\nThe Department of Education’s scrutiny “feels punitive,” Gómez [secretary for the Faculty Senate] said. “It feels like this is part of a trend to both try to dismantle higher education and to ultimately undermine faculty governance and academic freedom.” The department’s Title IX investigation is related to faculty governance, Gómez said, because the Faculty Senate had previously supported an effort to make campus bathrooms more welcoming to transgender people.\n\n\nOn Student Aid, It’s Congressional Republicans vs. DOGE\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/on-student-aid-its-congressional-republicans-vs-doge\n\nThe House Committee on Education & Workforce recently drafted legislation that would cut $350 billion in student aid. The savings come mostly from increasing loan-payment requirements and making it harder to qualify for Pell Grants. As others have explained, these measures will harm the lowest-income borrowers and reduce college access. If the committee has its way, the cuts will be bundled into a reconciliation bill in which these savings would pay for tax cuts tilted heavily toward the wealthy.\n\n\nanother surprising roadblock to the House accountability provisions should loom large: …DOGE. … Now that DOGE has forced out half the Education Department’s staff and President Trump is looking to eviscerate it, such execution will be out of reach. In other words, today’s Republican Party has a lot of different factions, but they can’t all win: If conservative lawmakers mean for the department to implement the accountability ideas in their current proposal, they will need to confront the Trump administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nSurely Not?\n\nhttps://www.nybooks.com/articles/2025/05/29/surely-not-manchurian-candidate-president/\n(VAC says this is worth reading, though it is behind a paywall.)\n\nImagine that the president of the United States was a “Manchurian candidate,” an embedded foreign agent determined to wreak maximum damage on the country and limited only by the need not to act so outrageously and preposterously as to blow his cover.

There is no other logical explanation.\n\n(Well, the argument of destroying competing power bases is another explanation. If a sharpie can be used to rewrite truth without pesky pushback…)\n\nThe EU is licking its chops over this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. According to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, while on stage at Sorbonne University, the EU Executive Branch has already decided to set up a “super grant” program, aimed at “longer-term perspective to the very best in the field.”\n\n\nthe Commission is authorizing additional funding of $566 million in 2025-2027, making Europe “a magnet for researchers.” This funding is in addition to the European Research Council’s budget of $18 billion for 2021-2027. Moreover, the EU will “enshrine freedom of scientific research into law” via a new enactment. Europe will not compromise on its long-standing principles of academic freedom.\n\n\n“The administration has issued a multi-pronged, anti-science attack on the health sciences. Possibly the most destructive is the recent slashing of research funding for both NIH and the National Science Foundation.” – the Hill 3/2/2025",

It informed the organizers of a Danish lecture series — one I was soon scheduled to speak at — that the final portion of American funding would be released only after they signed a statement essentially saying they were in compliance with a U.S. executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n\nBefore the organizers at the University of Southern Denmark could respond, the U.S. State Department sent an even blunter message: The grant was “being terminated for the convenience of the U.S. government.” It concluded by thanking the Danes “for your partnering with the Department of State and God Bless America.”\n\n\nSecond, the cutoff of funding was followed nearly two weeks later by another message to the university. (I viewed copies of all the emails.) It said that a recent court hearing prevented the State Department from holding up congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds and ordered it to make the financing available. It further ordered the department to “provide written notice of this order” to recipients of grants. Notifying the Danish university was as far as the administration went in complying with the court. The remaining funds haven’t been released yet, organizers say — typical of the Trump administration’s defiance of the courts.\n\n\nAnother core element of freedom — indeed something essential to its survival — is that power must be limited; there have to be checks and balances not just within government but within society. I have long warned that the concentration of wealth among a small percentage of the population would provide a fertile field for a demagogue, and that there was an ample supply of people who might play the part.\n\n\nUniversities, which protect academic freedom, are as important to this system of checks and balances as other civil rights protections like freedom of the press.\n\n\nNYU Withholds Diploma Due to Pro-Palestinian Commencement Speech\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/16/nyu-withholds-diploma-due-pro-palestinian-grad-speech\n\nRozos spoke at the ceremony for the university’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study.

    "text": "Can Scientific Research Survive Without Federal Funding?\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/business/revenue-strategies/2025/05/12/can-scientific-research-survive-without-federal-funding\n\nIn February, the Yale School of Medicine began offering temporary funding to researchers with terminated grants—many related to topics the Trump administration has deemed unworthy of scientific inquiry, such as transgender health—to give them time to reorient their research. Yale’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is also investing $4 million to support graduate students who have lost training and research grants. Similarly, last month Johns Hopkins University announced that it is tapping earnings from its $13.2 billion endowment to give researchers $100,000 each for delayed grants, or $150,000 for terminated grants, during a 12-month period. And Northwestern University—which hasn’t received any grant payments from the National Institutes of Health since March—is offering faculty up to $50,000 to maintain projects for up to one year.\n\n(Hopefully CUNY will be providing some relief in this manner as well)\n\nOver the past several decades, universities have already substantially increased the amount of money they spend on their own research and development—from 10 percent of the total in 1970 to 25 percent in 2023, according to federal data. Meanwhile, federal support for academic research has been on the decline, falling from 71 percent to 55 percent during that same timeframe. And support from industry, charities and other sources have always been marginal, collectively making up about 15 percent of contributions to research funding at colleges and universities in 2023.\n\n\nWhile that won’t cover all of the terminated grants, “the bridge has to go somewhere,” he said, explaining that the program isn’t supporting projects that don’t have viable alternative long-term funding options. Instead, “we’re providing funding for projects where the faculty member has other sources of funding and other proposals with the same or different federal agencies,” Díaz de la Rubia said.

That number would climb to a 14 percent tax for colleges with endowments valued at $1.25 to $2 million per student. Colleges at the highest level with endowments of $2 million or more per student would pay 21 percent.

Thanks VAC)\n\n\n\n\nWhy I’m Resigning from the NSF and Library of Congress | TIME\n\nhttps://time.com/7285045/resigning-national-science-foundation-library-congress/\n\nFreedom of expression is not merely an abstract principle, or even a constitutional right, but a practical necessity for meaningful advisory work. In Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, published as short stories in the late 1940s and as a novel in 1953, warned not only of the destruction of books, but of a society in which people had lost the desire to read them. The parallel today is not only the administration’s effort to destroy and suppress knowledge, but also the institution’s willingness to accept the cultivated irrelevance of it—a challenge that undermines any serious effort to conduct research, inform policy, or guide public institutions.\n\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF)—established as an independent agency through the National Science Act of 1950 and marking its 75th anniversary this week—traces its roots to Vannevar Bush’s landmark report, “Science, the Endless Frontier,” addressed to President Harry S. Truman. But we might also see the establishment of this premier research institution as reflecting a response to fears depicted by Bradbury. The NSF can be understood not only as a catalyst of scientific promise for national purpose, but also as a guarded response to fears about centralized control over knowledge and thought, shaped by the dark shadows of the Third Reich and the emerging Red Scare.\n\n\nLast week, as the Board held its 494th meeting, I listened to NSF staff say that DOGE had by fiat the authority to give thumbs up or down to grant applications which had been systematically vetted by layers of subject matter experts.\n\n\nOur closed-to-the-public deliberations were observed by Zachary Terrell from the DOGE team. Through his Zoom screen, Terrell showed more interest in his water bottle and his cuticles than in the discussion. According to Nature Terrell, listed as a “consultant” in the NSF directory, had accessed the NSF awards system to block the dispersal of approved grants. The message I received was that the National Science Board had a role to play in name only.\n\n\nAll of this is threatened by the creeping normalization of authoritarian approaches to knowledge management and academic freedom. The National Science Board has not been disbanded like so many other statutorily established, independent agencies in the federal government. But preservation of form provides little consolation when function has been strategically neutralized, mirroring the backsliding that scholars have thoroughly documented: maintaining legitimacy for institutions that no longer honor their founding purposes. This hollowing out is not just about governance in the abstract, it has material consequences for which research questions get asked, which datasets get produced, which knowledge gets produced, and which perspectives shape our understanding of pressing societal challenges. It has consequences for the integrity of knowledge itself.\n\n\nLast week, the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, was summarily dismissed via an email addressed to “Carla” from a White House HR administrator. The Trump Administration claimed that she was fired for “things she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.” It is true that Hayden was repeatedly on record as saying the Library should be for all Americans. And it is false that the Library, which is intended to hold all books published in the United States, lends books to children. The ouster of Hayden is part of a broader pattern of political targeting of women and Black public servants across the federal government.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Cancels Scores of Grants to Study Online Misinformation\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/trump-online-misinformation-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast month, the National Science Foundation, a government agency that finances much of the scientific research in the United States, began canceling hundreds of grants. Most focused on studies involving issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, but scores singled out work on online content.\n\n\nThe cancellation has jeopardized research in universities in virtually every state, leaving researchers scrambling to find funding for projects that in many cases are only partly completed.\n\n\nEach Friday since then, the foundation has announced new cancellations. It has now cut more than 1,400 grants, including 75 more last Friday. In all, the grants were worth more than $1 billion, according to a list compiled by two researchers, Scott W. Delaney, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health, and Noam Ross, the executive director of rOpenSci, a nonprofit software foundation. None of the grant abstracts reviewed by The New York Times called for censoring content.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Cuts Off Budding CUNY Scientists From Mentorship and Aid\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/05/14/cuny-urise-science-research-nih-trump/\n\nThe Trump administration has cut off support that has sustained a teaching model that for decades has been instrumental in catapulting students into careers as scientists.\n\n\nFunded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE) supports the pursuit of advanced degrees by students in the biomedical field, who are offered tuition assistance, mentorship, registration to professional conferences and, crucially, lab experience.\n\n\nNIH canceled all U-RISE funding at City College, Queens College, Brooklyn College, Lehman College and Medgar Evers College. … Professors who work with students in the program say the federal defunding will likely doom the program, and with it vital opportunities to conduct research while attending a public college — putting them on track for further academic research.\n\n\n“University leadership is working to support everyone in our community and will pursue every avenue available to sustain CUNY as a preeminent research institution,” wrote Noah Gardy.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEH Announces Grant Opportunity to Create Statues of Iconic Americans for the National Garden of American Heroes | National Endowment for the Humanities\n\nhttps://www.neh.gov/news/neh-announces-grant-opportunity-create-statues-iconic-americans-national-garden-american\n(This isn’t new, but still galling)\n\nThe NIH Is Requiring Grantees to Follow Trump’s Anti-Trans Executive Order\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-nih-is-requiring-grantees-to-follow-trumps-anti-trans-executive-order\n\nAnd she [researcher at a teaching hospital] learned that the grantee was expected to comply with the gender-equity law Title IX — “including the requirements set forth in Presidential Executive Order 14168 titled Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” That’s the executive order President Trump signed on the first day of his second term, directing the government to recognize two sexes, male and female.\n\n\nThe new policies apply to institutions that accept funds on scientists’ behalf, according to two lawyers who reviewed the language. So if a university accepts a grant with these terms, it could be at risk if the government considers anyone at that campus — not just the scientist spending the money — to be perpetuating “DEI” or “gender ideology extremism.”\n\n\nThe NIH reserves the right to “terminate financial assistance awards and recover all funds,” states its April 21 policy on diversity. And the term sheet citing the anti-transgender executive order states that payments “are predicated on compliance with the above requirements.” It says that violators can be held liable criminally as well as under the False Claims Act, the anti-government defraudment law.\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Association of American Universities, which represents research universities, said that the organization was aware of the language, but declined to comment further.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Nominates Iowa Regent to be Assistant Secretary of Postsecondary Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/12/trump-nominates-assistant-secretary-postsecondary-ed\n\n[David] Barker would focus on improving outcomes and accountability by reforming accreditation, improving federal student aid programs and ensuring grant programs match the Trump administration’s priorities.\n\n\nBarker was an Iowa regent for six years where he advanced cost control measures, promoted academic freedom and ended “discriminatory DEI programs,” according to the release.\n\n(On wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_R._Barker] we can read about what planet this guy lives on: “Barker is the author of Welcome to Free America, a book set in 2057 as a guide to immigrants coming to the former United States after the collapse of government. It describes a difficult period of transition, but eventually, private companies take over functions previously performed by governments, such as security, dispute resolution, production of money and infrastructure, and national defense.”)\n\n\n\n\nThe hidden ways Trump, DOGE are shutting down parts of the U.S. government\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/05/11/trump-government-operations-halt-funding-cuts/\n(Nothing higher ed related, but similar things are reported with grants.

The change, according to the NSF, “is intended to streamline funding practices, increase transparency, and ensure that more resources are directed toward direct scientific and engineering research activities.”",

It is now the single largest foreign funder of American universities, according to U.S. Education Department data, providing more than $6 billion over the past 15 years through gifts or contracts with schools including Cornell, Georgetown and Northwestern.\n\n\nThe outsize higher-education funding levels have drawn criticism since the start of Israel’s war in Gaza from Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration over allegations that the money from Qatar and other Arab states was skewing teaching about Israel and the region.

The university, it alleged, had violated Title IX by allowing transgender female students in women’s restrooms, locker rooms, and dorm rooms.\n\n\nPayton McNabb, a former student whose complaints about WCU’s transgender policies brought conservative media attention to the university, said she didn’t experience WCU as quiet. She felt professors treated conservative students differently, and she was hurt by a university Title IX investigation into her conduct after she posted a video of herself asking a transgender woman why she was in a women’s bathroom on campus.\n\n\nThe emails that seem to have triggered the Department of Education’s investigation have been framed by Speech First [a group dedicated to protecting the expression of certain conservative stances at colleges] as evidence that WCU is deliberately defying President Donald Trump.\n\n\nThe Department of Education’s scrutiny “feels punitive,” Gómez [secretary for the Faculty Senate] said. “It feels like this is part of a trend to both try to dismantle higher education and to ultimately undermine faculty governance and academic freedom.” The department’s Title IX investigation is related to faculty governance, Gómez said, because the Faculty Senate had previously supported an effort to make campus bathrooms more welcoming to transgender people.\n\n\nOn Student Aid, It’s Congressional Republicans vs. DOGE\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/on-student-aid-its-congressional-republicans-vs-doge\n\nThe House Committee on Education & Workforce recently drafted legislation that would cut $350 billion in student aid. The savings come mostly from increasing loan-payment requirements and making it harder to qualify for Pell Grants. As others have explained, these measures will harm the lowest-income borrowers and reduce college access. If the committee has its way, the cuts will be bundled into a reconciliation bill in which these savings would pay for tax cuts tilted heavily toward the wealthy.\n\n\nanother surprising roadblock to the House accountability provisions should loom large: …DOGE. … Now that DOGE has forced out half the Education Department’s staff and President Trump is looking to eviscerate it, such execution will be out of reach. In other words, today’s Republican Party has a lot of different factions, but they can’t all win: If conservative lawmakers mean for the department to implement the accountability ideas in their current proposal, they will need to confront the Trump administration.",

Last year, a majority of us signed cards in support of forming our faculty union so that we can establish a real voice in our working lives.\n\n\nUnfortunately, USC has so far refused to honor our desire for a stronger voice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard’s Battle Is Familiar to a University the Right Forced into Exile\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/08/us/trump-harvard-hungary-orban-george-soros.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAs the Trump administration escalates its pressure campaign, more people in American higher education — and in Vienna — believe the U.S. government is borrowing from a playbook refined in recent years by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who used state power to menace a university he disdained, upend academic independence and strengthen his ideological grip on Hungary.\n\n\n“At the abstract level, it’s the same,” said Carsten Q. Schneider, a German scholar who has worked for C.E.U. for more than 20 years and will become its interim president and rector in August.\n\n\n“These demands, these requirements, they are a scale of detail that Orban never bothered with,” Tim Crane, a Britain-born philosophy professor, said at C.E.U.\n\n\n“Universities and their allies need to speak up in defense of core values,” she [Amy Gutmann, a political scientist who led the University of Pennsylvania for nearly 18 years and then served as President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s ambassador to Germany] said, adding that “the C.E.U. experience warns against the instinct to make concessions to an administration that’s intent on punishing the political opposition.”\n\n\nIn Mr. Orban’s Hungary, sometimes described as a “propaganda state,” the government transferred control of public universities to foundations — controlled by the ruling party’s allies — and gender studies essentially became a forbidden academic discipline.\n\n\nIn 2017, the Hungarian government, which some prominent figures on the American right have praised, stepped up its effort to undermine the American-accredited university. The campaign was built on legal maneuvering, including a hastily passed law, struck down years later by the European Court of Justice, effectively requiring C.E.U. to open a new campus in the United States.\n\n\nThe university tried to negotiate, but talks with the Hungarian government failed in late 2018. Thousands of Hungarians protested the government’s tactics that year — “Even Voldemort didn’t kick Hogwarts out,” read one sign — but C.E.U. said it had no choice but to leave.\n\n\nEva Kiser, a museum studies student at C.E.U. who is from Knoxville, Tenn., said she had been counting on political firewalls in the United States to hold and that things would “blow over.”\n\n\n“But that’s not really looking probable,” she said.\n\n\n“Don’t expect mercy, or that this is normal and you need to sort of be nice and then they come to their senses,” Dr. Schneider, the incoming interim rector, said. “It is unhinged. …”\n\n\nBorrowing an idea from the economist Albert O. Hirschman, Professor Dorsch, an American, said universities had three options: leave, obey the government or speak up.\n\n(Lots of salient quotes here, an article well worth reading, as the mafia state has learned some things from the propaganda state.)\n\nNotes from an Occupation\n\nhttps://www.nybooks.com/articles/2025/06/26/notes-from-an-occupation-marilynne-robinson/\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nA well-planned occupation seizes the heights of the defeated civilization, so that the people will see their leaders ousted or humiliated and made docile. It will likewise discredit and weaken those features of the culture in which its people placed confidence and pride. If this model were applied to our situation, we might expect to see the Supreme Court diminished, the Congress disempowered, and the Constitution desacralized by indifference or contempt. The press would come under attack. Our incomparable universities and research institutions would lose autonomy and resources. The mighty dollar would be weakened. Bonds with allies would be breached, and the occupied country would be held in contempt for the damage its default had done to the world order, and to democracy, having put aside its responsibility for demonstrating the viability of popular government.\n\n\nExamples of the seizing of cultural heights abound. In 70 AD the Romans utterly razed the Temple at Jerusalem and Jerusalem itself in order to deal with the Jewish population’s resistance to their oppression. In 1814 the British, still wanting to break the back of the Revolution, burned the American Capitol Building, destroying the Library of Congress.\n\n\nI am proposing, of course, that America actually is, at present, an occupied country. I will call the occupiers Red and the occupied Blue, since these colors are in general use for distinctions of this kind and seemingly cause no offense.\n\n(More behind a paywall, I’m sure)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: We Watched Dozens of Graduation Speeches.

Some of the groups involved include OEDP, the Data Rescue Project, Safeguarding Research and Culture, the Internet Archive, the End of Term Archive, and the Data.gov Archive, which is run by the Harvard Law School Library.\n\n\n… “That took time,” Richards said, noting that not every data set and its accompanying metadata was easy to replicate. “Each varied significantly. Some required scraping. In one case I had to manually download 400 files, clicking each one every few minutes.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIH scientists go public with criticism over Trump cuts | AP News\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/nih-letter-bethesda-declaration-bhattacharya-89724aee201f3e99fc1159adcbf9ac94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFulbright Board Quits, Accusing Trump Administration of Political Interference - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/politics/fulbright-board-resign-trump.html\n\nThe dozen board members of the prestigious Fulbright program that promotes international educational exchanges resigned on Wednesday because of what they said was political interference by the Trump administration in their operations, according to people familiar with the issues and a board memo obtained by The New York Times.\n\nhttps://substack.com/inbox/post/165673358?r=17cemi\n\nThe members are concerned that political appointees at the State Department, which manages the program, are acting illegally by canceling the awarding of Fulbright scholarships to almost 200 American professors and researchers who are prepared to go to universities and other research institutions overseas starting this summer,\n\n\nIn addition, the department is reviewing the applications of about 1,200 scholars from other countries who have already been approved by the board to come to the United States, the people said. Those foreign scholars were also supposed to receive acceptance letters around April.\n\n\nThe board is also concerned that the budget that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is requesting from Congress for the next fiscal year cuts spending for the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, which includes the Fulbright program, to $50 million from $691 million this fiscal year.\n\n\n“The bipartisan Fulbright Board was mandated by Congress to be a check on the executive and to ensure that students, researchers and educators are not subjected to the blatant political favoritism that this administration is known for,” Ms. Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.\n\n\n“While I understand and respect the bipartisan Fulbright Board for resigning en masse rather than grant credibility to a politicized and unlawful process,” she added, “I am painfully aware that today’s move will change the quality of Fulbright programming and the independent research that has made our country a leader in so many fields.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColleges Can’t Trust the Federal Government. What Now?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/colleges-cant-trust-the-federal-government-what-now\n\nSupport from the federal government has been so consistent and made such good sense that colleges and universities have built their budgets, infrastructure, and programming around the assumption of its permanence. Trump 2.0 has shown what happens when the government does not behave sensibly and has turned an essential lifeline into an existential risk.\n\n\nThe scorched-earth assault on Harvard University is generating all the headlines, but it might in fact be drawing attention away from an even larger story: the tectonic shift in the future activities and financial underpinnings of American higher education and the even greater risk to institutions that have neither Harvard’s resources nor Harvard’s reputation.\n\n\nEven if universities manage to muddle through Trump’s vindictive irrationality, can they return to building budget models that assume consistently high levels of federal support? JD Vance is waiting in the wings, and who knows what new Trumps and Vances the future might bring?\n\n\nA small group of the most prestigious and selective universities might be able to substitute affluent domestic students for affluent international students at the undergraduate level, though even those institutions would likely have trouble doing so for master’s-degree programs, where costs are high and return on investment can be questionable. For most colleges, such a substitution would be impossible and tuition revenue would necessarily decline. Subtract the full-paying international students from the applicant pool and an already fragile financial structure would begin very quickly to collapse.\n\n\nFor the ideologues driving the administration’s policies on education and immigration — Linda McMahon and Kristi Noem are not the brains behind this operation — the destructive effects of these various policies are very much the point. None of the consequences we are seeing are unintended.\n\n\nDevastating scientific research and systematically undermining the preeminence of American universities — like so many of the actions of the Trump administration — represents a triumph of vindictiveness and nihilism over sound public policy. But here we are, about to see how quickly and adroitly the embattled and change-resistant world of higher education can adapt to a future in which the government cannot be trusted.\n\n\n\n\n\nCiting Ohio’s SB 1, College Refuses to Sign Union Contract\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/labor-unionization/2025/06/12/citing-ohios-sb-1-college-refuses-sign-union\n\nUnited Faculty of Central Ohio Technical College union members and their institution are both citing state law in a dispute over whether the institution must sign a new collective bargaining agreement—or gut provisions it agreed to earlier in order to comply with the state’s sweeping new public higher education law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Texas, University Presidents May Soon Control Faculty Senates\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/06/09/texas-presidents-may-soon-control-faculty-senates\n\nA bill awaiting Gov. Abbott’s signature would require college administrators to set procedures for faculty governing bodies and appoint their leaders, part of an effort to address “liberal faculty control over universities.”\n\n\n“Shared governance structures may not be used to obstruct, delay, or undermine necessary institutional reforms or serve as a mechanism for advancing ideological or political agendas,” says Senate Bill 37, which the Republican-dominated State Legislature passed May 31. Multiple states have considered GOP bills targeting shared governance, but SB 37 is a sweeping example.\n\n\nIf a college or university board decides to keep a faculty governing body, the institution’s president gets to prescribe how it conducts meetings. The president also gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary.”\n\n\nIn addition, unless the college or university’s board decides otherwise, faculty senates and councils must shrink to no more than 60 members.\n\n\nIn another blow to faculty control of their own governance bodies, SB 37 establishes term limits for faculty senate and council members—and allows presidential appointees to serve longer than the elected members.\n\n(Two years, then a two year break)\n\nA faculty senate or council member could also have their seat stripped at any time; the bill says the provost can recommend to the president that members be “immediately removed” for failing to attend meetings or conduct their “responsibilities within the council’s or senate’s parameters” or for “similar misconduct.”\n\n(Will this be a national template if Abbott signs this bill? The reporting attributes the bill to one legislator, but I doubt their office drafted it.)\n\nTrump Ends Vital Higher Ed Data System Training\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/09/department-education-discontinues-ipeds-training\n\nUsed to track trends in higher education enrollment, completion, financial aid usage and other institutional characteristics, IPEDS survey data has long been critical to higher education research. But in order to access and utilize the data, institutions need to know how to properly complete the survey and researchers need to know how to navigate the database.\n\n\nProject 2025 Author to Work at Education Department\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/09/project-2025-author-work-education-department\n\nThe Trump administration announced Friday that Lindsey Burke, the director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation, will be the department’s deputy chief of staff for policy and programs. Burke also authored the Education Department chapter of Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint that called for sweeping changes to higher education policy, from privatizing student loans to rolling back LGBTQ+ protections in Title IX.\n\n\nExclusive | Leaders of CUNY, other college antisemitism hotbeds to be grilled by House panel next month\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2025/06/09/us-news/leaders-of-cuny-other-college-antisemitism-hotbeds-to-be-grilled-by-house-panel-next-month/\n(No need to click through.

Both would cap graduate loans, open up the Pell Grant program to short-term programs and cut all but one option for income-driven loan repayment.\n\n\nMost notably, the Senate bill does not include a limit on traditional Pell Grant eligibility that would have excluded thousands of part-time students, as the House version did, and it walks back the House’s controversial risk-sharing plan, which would force colleges to pay a penalty based on students’ unpaid loans.\n\n\nRepublicans are keen on college sports legislation.

Now Trump May Force Him Out.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/07/us/trump-harvard-international-student-ban.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFive weeks later, just after the end of the spring semester, Mr. Williamson [rom Wales], now at a summer abroad program, picked up his phone and saw a pileup of missed calls and messages. The threat his friends had dismissed had become a searing reality: The federal government had effectively blocked Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students — abruptly thrusting Mr. Williamson and others into an excruciating limbo.\n\n\nHe had arrived in Cambridge, Mass., intent on studying physics, drawn to its broad range of useful applications in other sciences. Then, during his first semester, he found a new passion — in a politics course taught by Steven Levitsky, the author of the best-selling book “How Democracies Die,” that featured a deep dive into authoritarianism. After that, Mr. Williamson planned to become a double major in physics and government. Maybe someday, he thought, he would make his own foray into politics or public service.\n\n\n“It was the best year of my life,” he said.\n\n\nIn recent weeks, long-simmering Republican anger over Harvard’s links to China has increasingly gained traction\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/world/china/harvards-china-ties-become-new-front-in-battle-with-trump-6eb24947?st=D2uR9P&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(There is always something to stir up republican anger…)\n\nTrump indicated that his concern about the Xinjiang corps was based on findings of a House Select Committee on China. Its chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar (R., Mich.), late last month wrote to Harvard President Alan Garber, demanding explanations about university activities that “create risks to U.S. national security and further the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) genocide in Xinjiang.”\n\n\nIn Public, Harvard Is Fighting Trump. Quietly, It’s Dismantling a Program the White House Doesn’t Like.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/in-public-harvard-is-fighting-trump-quietly-its-dismantling-a-program-the-white-house-doesnt-like\n\nHarvard University has spent the last year slowly dismantling a religious-studies program that critics said was biased against Israel, five current and former university employees told The Chronicle. Last week, the final hammer fell: The five remaining staff members employed by the Religion and Public Life program were called, one by one, into meetings with a representative from Harvard’s human-resources department and the program’s interim director, David F. Holland. There, all learned their contracts would not be renewed.\n\n\nThe program puts out a “wide range” of events and courses, McKanan said. But since the October 7 attacks, the program’s teaching around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has drawn criticism from those who argue Harvard’s campus is a hotbed of antisemitism.\n\n\nIn an internal report on antisemitism published in April, a task force of professors, students, and advisers had suggested that a lack of rigor among “nonladder” faculty at Harvard was partly to blame for programs and events that task-force members characterized as antisemitic. The task force recommended tenured Harvard faculty members exercise greater oversight of programs.\n\n\nNonladder — or non-tenure-track — faculty deliver about half of the curriculum at the Divinity School, said McKanan, who has a nonladder contract and has been at Harvard for 17 years. “When Harvard chooses to rely on nonladder faculty,” he said, “it becomes a little bit strange and unnatural to exclude that half of the faculty from program leadership and from sponsoring public events on issues of urgent public concern.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Rubio Is Pressing to Open Sanctions Investigation Into Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/politics/rubio-is-pressing-to-open-sanctions-investigation-into-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(More weaponization of the federal government, err “Trump administration’s whole-of-government approach to bringing the Ivy League university to heel.”)\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is pushing to investigate whether Harvard University violated federal sanctions by collaborating on a health insurance conference in China that may have included officials blacklisted by the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The New York Times.\n\n\nMr. Trump and his allies appear determined [hell-bent] to upend nearly all aspects of the institution, which has long symbolized the pinnacle of higher learning in the country and attracted influential scholars from around the globe.\n\n(And here we see the fingerprints of the Manhattan Institute)\n\nStill, the X.P.C.C.’s involvement in the conference only recently gained attention from Trump allies, after a report about Harvard’s links to China published on April 22 by Strategy Risks, a New York-based intelligence company specializing in corporate exposure to China. The report was funded by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank that has advised Republican policymakers.\n\n\nNYTimes: What Happens if ‘Harvard Is Not Harvard’?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/harvard-funding-trump-administration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n“Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” school officials wrote in a lawsuit asking a judge to stop the federal government’s actions.\n\n\nIt left unsaid what Harvard, if it were no longer Harvard, would become.\n\n\nBut without federal dollars or international talent, experts say, Harvard could fall out of the top tier for research, where it currently sits with competitors like Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. By sheer dollars spent, its research budget could shrink to something similar to that of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, which spent just over $800 million on research in 2023, roughly half of what Harvard spends now.\n\n\nHarvard could choose to negotiate. But inside the university, officials appear reluctant to do that, given the backlash they could face for capitulating to Mr. Trump. This spring, the university took out $750 million in debt, giving it some cash flow as court decisions play out.\n\n\nThe atmosphere is particularly tense inside the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which relies on federal funding for 46 percent of its budget and has a student body that is about 40 percent international. Senior officials there are planning for the worst, and have called the potential changes an “existential crisis” for the school’s future.\n\n\nBut Harvard’s biggest source of funding is donations and payouts from its endowment, which together make up 45 percent of its revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Indiana U., Professors Spar With Administrators Over Nighttime Protests\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/at-indiana-u-professors-spar-with-administrators-over-nighttime-protests\n\nUnder a policy passed in response to a monthslong pro-Palestinian encampment at Indiana, certain forms of “expressive activity” — including holding protests, making speeches, and circulating petitions — were banned on campus between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Administrators argued that the changes were necessary to ensure safety after the encampment got out of hand.\n\n\nThe policy banned protests between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., required 10-day prior approval for installing “structures and/or mass physical objects,” and pushed protests 25 feet away from building entrances.\n\n\nStudents and staff sued over the policy. In late May, a federal judge temporarily blocked the nighttime restrictions.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the political climate surrounding the university remains contentious. Last week, Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, removed the three alumni-elected trustees from Indiana’s board — including two who voted against the expressive-activity policy — and replaced them with conservatives, including a prominent lawyer and a former ESPN anchor.\n\n\nTexas lawmakers just approved legislation broadly banning “any speech or expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment” between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. at public universities. The measure now awaits the governor’s signature.\n\n\nBut Indiana’s expressive-activity policy never specified how many nighttime protesters were too many. That meant even a protest involving two people — unlikely to be a threat to public safety — would require prior approval, the judge said in her order granting the preliminary injunction.\n\n\nWhile the decision was far from “novel or surprising,” it will hopefully send a message to universities imposing similar policies that “the courts are not going to put up with this kind of similarly open violation of the First Amendment and so they probably shouldn’t try it,” said Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the George Washington University Law School.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Administration Proposes Cutting Tribal College Funds by Nearly 90% — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/tribal-colleges-universities-trump-cuts-funding\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed cutting funding for tribal colleges and universities by nearly 90%, a move that would likely shut down most or all of the institutions created to serve students disadvantaged by the nation’s historic mistreatment of Indigenous communities.\n\n\nThe document mentions only the two federally controlled tribal colleges — Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute — but notes the request for postsecondary programs will drop from more than $182 million this year to just over $22 million for 2026.\n\n\nInside UNC’s Effort to Launch a New Accreditor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/accreditation/2025/06/06/emails-shed-light-uncs-plans-create-new-accreditor\n\nLast month, Peter Hans, president of the University of North Carolina system, casually dropped a bombshell announcement that the system and others were in talks to launch a new accreditor.\n\n\n“We’ve been having a number of discussions with several other major public university systems, where we’re exploring the idea of creating an accreditor that would offer sound oversight,” Hans said at a UNC system Board of Governors meeting last month, The News & Observer reported.\n\n\nhave been quietly engaged in conversations about launching a new accreditor for at least a year, including discussions with unnamed collaborators in Florida, where the effort could be headquartered. UNC officials have also spoken with officials at the U.S. Department of Education, even getting a heads-up on what an April 23 executive order from the Trump administration on accreditation would entail.\n\n\n“Everything Florida has done on accreditation over the past few years appears to be politically and ideologically driven, rather than about what is best for students and ensuring that they go to high-quality institutions and get a good education when they’re paying a lot of money for it and when taxpayers are investing a lot of money in public funding for higher education,” he said [Edward Conroy, a senior policy manager at the left-leaning think tank New America].\n\n\nConroy worries that state lawmakers in either Florida or North Carolina would require public colleges in their state to be accredited by their new accreditor. That would undermine the current requirement that colleges get to choose their own accreditor.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard, Duke, Stanford and other wealthy universities are hoping to avoid a huge potential tax hike by pitching an alternative plan to Congress: a pledge to spend more of their own money\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/colleges-hope-to-stave-off-big-tax-hike-by-pledging-to-spend-more-endowment-cash-353606fb?st=FTbBSQ&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(They will spend 5% of their endowments.

The number of Americans doing study abroad programs in China peaked at nearly 15,000 in 2011, before plummeting to 211 during the pandemic, when visa restrictions and rippling covid lockdowns made it hard for foreigners to enter the country.\n\n\nU.S. Curb on Chinese Students a Boon for Asian Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/2025/06/10/us-curbs-chinese-students-boon-asian-universities\n\n“We’re not seeing sensationalist headlines in the media, and many families are watching and waiting for the final policy outcome and specific rules from the State Department,” he said. “There is an increasing awareness that the administration’s policies often start with big headlines of assertive nationalist policy, but they often end up being mitigated, reduced or overturned altogether.”\n\n\nHongqing Yang, managing director of the Hong Kong–based consultancy The Educationist, said the Chinese government is likely “to encourage domestic institutions, including those in Hong Kong and Macao, as well as transnational education institutions and joint programs, to accommodate more students” in the wake of the news.\n\n\nIn Hong Kong, the government explicitly encouraged universities to enroll Harvard students following the news.\n\n\nLaurie Pearcey, adviser to the president and college master at the University of Hong Kong Shenzhen, described the situation as a “free kick for Hong Kong.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Red-State Universities Will Get Hit by Trump’s Cuts, Too\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/opinion/trump-harvard-scientific-research.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nRather than striking a blow for red-state America, these cuts would actually take a heavy toll on many of the communities in states that went for Mr. Trump in the last election — whose research universities serve as crucial anchors for industry and innovation.\n\n\nIf Mr. Trump wants to make all of America great again, he shouldn’t cut funding for scientific research. He should increase it.\n\n(He doesn’t, ed.)\n\nIf the United States wants to compete with other countries for manufacturing jobs, our best strategy is to leverage our exceptional university research capabilities to rebuild our manufacturing base.\n\n\nUniversities have long played pivotal roles in building world-class high-tech economies: Stanford University helped make Silicon Valley what it is today by fostering technological excellence in electrical engineering, establishing the Stanford Research Park and educating the founders of startups like Hewlett-Packard. Individuals from universities like M.I.T. and Harvard played central roles in transforming Boston from a center of textile and boot and shoe manufacturing to a health-sciences hub by starting the world’s first modern venture capital fund to commercialize academic research.\n\n\nCarnegie Mellon University helped revitalize Pittsburgh through targeted investments in computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics, coupled with strategic initiatives to bolster local entrepreneurship. The University of Texas at Austin mobilized local business and political leaders to transform Austin into a leading high-tech region. In all of these cases, universities led efforts to reposition their regional economies toward high-tech sectors such as computers, software, biotechnology and robotics.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump preparing large-scale cancellation of federal funding for California, sources say | CNN Politics\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/06/06/politics/trump-california-federal-funding\n(Could just be a feint, but…)\n\nJust last month, he threatened to withhold federal funding from California over a transgender athlete’s participation in a sporting event — the latest example of the president trying to use funding as leverage to enact his agenda. The administration recently cut $126.4 million in flood prevention funding projects, and Trump repeatedly went after the state’s handling of devastating wildfires earlier this year. The president and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have also publicly feuded for years.\n\n\nHigher education in the state could be hit hard by Trump’s move. GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California, who said he was unaware of the imminent grant cancellations, told CNN he recently met with university representatives who were concerned about the future of their funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the AI Tool Used by DOGE to Review Veterans Affairs Contracts — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/inside-ai-tool-doge-veterans-affairs-contracts-sahil-lavingia\n(Interesting take down of the engineered AI prompts used for this particular smash-and-grab)\n\nNYTimes: Welcome to Campus.

It is also running marketing campaigns aimed at getting students who have never used chatbots to try ChatGPT.\n\n\nOpenAI’s campaign is part of an escalating A.I. arms race among tech giants to win over universities and students with their chatbots. The company is following in the footsteps of rivals like Google and Microsoft that have for years pushed to get their computers and software into schools, and court students as future customers.\n\n(Big tech’s continued attempts to wrest control of education from the professoriate)\n\nOpenAI’s push to A.I.-ify college education amounts to a national experiment on millions of students. The use of these chatbots in schools is so new that their potential long-term educational benefits, and possible side effects, are not yet established.\n\n\nA few early studies have found that outsourcing tasks like research and writing to chatbots can diminish skills like critical thinking. And some critics argue that colleges going all-in on chatbots are glossing over issues like societal risks, A.I. labor exploitation and environmental costs.\n\n\nChinese AI firms block features amid high-stakes university entrance exams\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/10/china-exam-gaokao-ai-cheating-test/\n\nAs more than 13 million students filed into rooms across China to sit for the notoriously grueling, high-stakes gaokao college entrance exam, they already faced strict anti-cheating and real-time surveillance measures, including facial recognition technology, metal detectors, drones and cellphone-signal blockers. Vehicles transporting the test papers — classified as state secrets — are equipped with video surveillance. Copies of the test are stored in steel-reinforced rooms that can only be opened by three people, each wielding their own key. China made cheating on exams a criminal act in 2015 — punishable in some cases by prison sentences.\n\n\nThis year, AI companies joined in, adding a new layer to the ring of walls and moats around the exam.\n\n\nChinese AI model DeepSeek did not allow users to upload photos of test papers during the same period….AI tool Kimi allowed photo recognition on Tuesday, but uploading failed when it detected a test exam or paper. Doubao, the AI app owned by TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, appeared to suspend the uploading of test paper photos or screenshots, though other photos worked fine.\n\n\nThis year, some schools in China used real-time AI patrol and surveillance systems to check for suspicious behavior in the exam room: whispering, peeking, passing objects, answering early or using prohibited tools, Chinese state media outlets reported. It can detect the behavior during the exam and with a “post-exam intelligent search,” a Global Times article said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

    "text": "NYTimes: Harvard’s Battle Is Familiar to a University the Right Forced into Exile\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/08/us/trump-harvard-hungary-orban-george-soros.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAs the Trump administration escalates its pressure campaign, more people in American higher education — and in Vienna — believe the U.S. government is borrowing from a playbook refined in recent years by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who used state power to menace a university he disdained, upend academic independence and strengthen his ideological grip on Hungary.\n\n\n“At the abstract level, it’s the same,” said Carsten Q. Schneider, a German scholar who has worked for C.E.U. for more than 20 years and will become its interim president and rector in August.\n\n\n“These demands, these requirements, they are a scale of detail that Orban never bothered with,” Tim Crane, a Britain-born philosophy professor, said at C.E.U.\n\n\n“Universities and their allies need to speak up in defense of core values,” she [Amy Gutmann, a political scientist who led the University of Pennsylvania for nearly 18 years and then served as President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s ambassador to Germany] said, adding that “the C.E.U. experience warns against the instinct to make concessions to an administration that’s intent on punishing the political opposition.”\n\n\nIn Mr. Orban’s Hungary, sometimes described as a “propaganda state,” the government transferred control of public universities to foundations — controlled by the ruling party’s allies — and gender studies essentially became a forbidden academic discipline.\n\n\nIn 2017, the Hungarian government, which some prominent figures on the American right have praised, stepped up its effort to undermine the American-accredited university. The campaign was built on legal maneuvering, including a hastily passed law, struck down years later by the European Court of Justice, effectively requiring C.E.U. to open a new campus in the United States.\n\n\nThe university tried to negotiate, but talks with the Hungarian government failed in late 2018. Thousands of Hungarians protested the government’s tactics that year — “Even Voldemort didn’t kick Hogwarts out,” read one sign — but C.E.U. said it had no choice but to leave.\n\n\nEva Kiser, a museum studies student at C.E.U. who is from Knoxville, Tenn., said she had been counting on political firewalls in the United States to hold and that things would “blow over.”\n\n\n“But that’s not really looking probable,” she said.\n\n\n“Don’t expect mercy, or that this is normal and you need to sort of be nice and then they come to their senses,” Dr. Schneider, the incoming interim rector, said. “It is unhinged. …”\n\n\nBorrowing an idea from the economist Albert O. Hirschman, Professor Dorsch, an American, said universities had three options: leave, obey the government or speak up.\n\n(Lots of salient quotes here, an article well worth reading, as the mafia state has learned some things from the propaganda state.)\n\nNotes from an Occupation\n\nhttps://www.nybooks.com/articles/2025/06/26/notes-from-an-occupation-marilynne-robinson/\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nA well-planned occupation seizes the heights of the defeated civilization, so that the people will see their leaders ousted or humiliated and made docile. It will likewise discredit and weaken those features of the culture in which its people placed confidence and pride. If this model were applied to our situation, we might expect to see the Supreme Court diminished, the Congress disempowered, and the Constitution desacralized by indifference or contempt. The press would come under attack. Our incomparable universities and research institutions would lose autonomy and resources. The mighty dollar would be weakened. Bonds with allies would be breached, and the occupied country would be held in contempt for the damage its default had done to the world order, and to democracy, having put aside its responsibility for demonstrating the viability of popular government.\n\n\nExamples of the seizing of cultural heights abound. In 70 AD the Romans utterly razed the Temple at Jerusalem and Jerusalem itself in order to deal with the Jewish population’s resistance to their oppression. In 1814 the British, still wanting to break the back of the Revolution, burned the American Capitol Building, destroying the Library of Congress.\n\n\nI am proposing, of course, that America actually is, at present, an occupied country. I will call the occupiers Red and the occupied Blue, since these colors are in general use for distinctions of this kind and seemingly cause no offense.\n\n(More behind a paywall, I’m sure)",

Some of the groups involved include OEDP, the Data Rescue Project, Safeguarding Research and Culture, the Internet Archive, the End of Term Archive, and the Data.gov Archive, which is run by the Harvard Law School Library.\n\n\n… “That took time,” Richards said, noting that not every data set and its accompanying metadata was easy to replicate. “Each varied significantly. Some required scraping. In one case I had to manually download 400 files, clicking each one every few minutes.”",

Those foreign scholars were also supposed to receive acceptance letters around April.\n\n\nThe board is also concerned that the budget that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is requesting from Congress for the next fiscal year cuts spending for the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, which includes the Fulbright program, to $50 million from $691 million this fiscal year.\n\n\n“The bipartisan Fulbright Board was mandated by Congress to be a check on the executive and to ensure that students, researchers and educators are not subjected to the blatant political favoritism that this administration is known for,” Ms. Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.\n\n\n“While I understand and respect the bipartisan Fulbright Board for resigning en masse rather than grant credibility to a politicized and unlawful process,” she added, “I am painfully aware that today’s move will change the quality of Fulbright programming and the independent research that has made our country a leader in so many fields.”",

What Now?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/colleges-cant-trust-the-federal-government-what-now\n\nSupport from the federal government has been so consistent and made such good sense that colleges and universities have built their budgets, infrastructure, and programming around the assumption of its permanence. Trump 2.0 has shown what happens when the government does not behave sensibly and has turned an essential lifeline into an existential risk.\n\n\nThe scorched-earth assault on Harvard University is generating all the headlines, but it might in fact be drawing attention away from an even larger story: the tectonic shift in the future activities and financial underpinnings of American higher education and the even greater risk to institutions that have neither Harvard’s resources nor Harvard’s reputation.\n\n\nEven if universities manage to muddle through Trump’s vindictive irrationality, can they return to building budget models that assume consistently high levels of federal support? JD Vance is waiting in the wings, and who knows what new Trumps and Vances the future might bring?\n\n\nA small group of the most prestigious and selective universities might be able to substitute affluent domestic students for affluent international students at the undergraduate level, though even those institutions would likely have trouble doing so for master’s-degree programs, where costs are high and return on investment can be questionable. For most colleges, such a substitution would be impossible and tuition revenue would necessarily decline. Subtract the full-paying international students from the applicant pool and an already fragile financial structure would begin very quickly to collapse.\n\n\nFor the ideologues driving the administration’s policies on education and immigration — Linda McMahon and Kristi Noem are not the brains behind this operation — the destructive effects of these various policies are very much the point. None of the consequences we are seeing are unintended.\n\n\nDevastating scientific research and systematically undermining the preeminence of American universities — like so many of the actions of the Trump administration — represents a triumph of vindictiveness and nihilism over sound public policy. But here we are, about to see how quickly and adroitly the embattled and change-resistant world of higher education can adapt to a future in which the government cannot be trusted.\n\n\n\n\n\nCiting Ohio’s SB 1, College Refuses to Sign Union Contract\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/labor-unionization/2025/06/12/citing-ohios-sb-1-college-refuses-sign-union\n\nUnited Faculty of Central Ohio Technical College union members and their institution are both citing state law in a dispute over whether the institution must sign a new collective bargaining agreement—or gut provisions it agreed to earlier in order to comply with the state’s sweeping new public higher education law.",

Multiple states have considered GOP bills targeting shared governance, but SB 37 is a sweeping example.\n\n\nIf a college or university board decides to keep a faculty governing body, the institution’s president gets to prescribe how it conducts meetings. The president also gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary.”\n\n\nIn addition, unless the college or university’s board decides otherwise, faculty senates and councils must shrink to no more than 60 members.\n\n\nIn another blow to faculty control of their own governance bodies, SB 37 establishes term limits for faculty senate and council members—and allows presidential appointees to serve longer than the elected members.\n\n(Two years, then a two year break)\n\nA faculty senate or council member could also have their seat stripped at any time; the bill says the provost can recommend to the president that members be “immediately removed” for failing to attend meetings or conduct their “responsibilities within the council’s or senate’s parameters” or for “similar misconduct.”\n\n(Will this be a national template if Abbott signs this bill? The reporting attributes the bill to one legislator, but I doubt their office drafted it.)\n\nTrump Ends Vital Higher Ed Data System Training\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/09/department-education-discontinues-ipeds-training\n\nUsed to track trends in higher education enrollment, completion, financial aid usage and other institutional characteristics, IPEDS survey data has long been critical to higher education research. But in order to access and utilize the data, institutions need to know how to properly complete the survey and researchers need to know how to navigate the database.\n\n\nProject 2025 Author to Work at Education Department\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/09/project-2025-author-work-education-department\n\nThe Trump administration announced Friday that Lindsey Burke, the director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation, will be the department’s deputy chief of staff for policy and programs. Burke also authored the Education Department chapter of Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint that called for sweeping changes to higher education policy, from privatizing student loans to rolling back LGBTQ+ protections in Title IX.\n\n\nExclusive | Leaders of CUNY, other college antisemitism hotbeds to be grilled by House panel next month\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2025/06/09/us-news/leaders-of-cuny-other-college-antisemitism-hotbeds-to-be-grilled-by-house-panel-next-month/\n(No need to click through.

Both would cap graduate loans, open up the Pell Grant program to short-term programs and cut all but one option for income-driven loan repayment.\n\n\nMost notably, the Senate bill does not include a limit on traditional Pell Grant eligibility that would have excluded thousands of part-time students, as the House version did, and it walks back the House’s controversial risk-sharing plan, which would force colleges to pay a penalty based on students’ unpaid loans.\n\n\nRepublicans are keen on college sports legislation.

Now Trump May Force Him Out.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/07/us/trump-harvard-international-student-ban.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFive weeks later, just after the end of the spring semester, Mr. Williamson [rom Wales], now at a summer abroad program, picked up his phone and saw a pileup of missed calls and messages. The threat his friends had dismissed had become a searing reality: The federal government had effectively blocked Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students — abruptly thrusting Mr. Williamson and others into an excruciating limbo.\n\n\nHe had arrived in Cambridge, Mass., intent on studying physics, drawn to its broad range of useful applications in other sciences. Then, during his first semester, he found a new passion — in a politics course taught by Steven Levitsky, the author of the best-selling book “How Democracies Die,” that featured a deep dive into authoritarianism. After that, Mr. Williamson planned to become a double major in physics and government. Maybe someday, he thought, he would make his own foray into politics or public service.\n\n\n“It was the best year of my life,” he said.\n\n\nIn recent weeks, long-simmering Republican anger over Harvard’s links to China has increasingly gained traction\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/world/china/harvards-china-ties-become-new-front-in-battle-with-trump-6eb24947?st=D2uR9P&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(There is always something to stir up republican anger…)\n\nTrump indicated that his concern about the Xinjiang corps was based on findings of a House Select Committee on China. Its chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar (R., Mich.), late last month wrote to Harvard President Alan Garber, demanding explanations about university activities that “create risks to U.S. national security and further the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) genocide in Xinjiang.”\n\n\nIn Public, Harvard Is Fighting Trump. Quietly, It’s Dismantling a Program the White House Doesn’t Like.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/in-public-harvard-is-fighting-trump-quietly-its-dismantling-a-program-the-white-house-doesnt-like\n\nHarvard University has spent the last year slowly dismantling a religious-studies program that critics said was biased against Israel, five current and former university employees told The Chronicle. Last week, the final hammer fell: The five remaining staff members employed by the Religion and Public Life program were called, one by one, into meetings with a representative from Harvard’s human-resources department and the program’s interim director, David F. Holland. There, all learned their contracts would not be renewed.\n\n\nThe program puts out a “wide range” of events and courses, McKanan said. But since the October 7 attacks, the program’s teaching around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has drawn criticism from those who argue Harvard’s campus is a hotbed of antisemitism.\n\n\nIn an internal report on antisemitism published in April, a task force of professors, students, and advisers had suggested that a lack of rigor among “nonladder” faculty at Harvard was partly to blame for programs and events that task-force members characterized as antisemitic. The task force recommended tenured Harvard faculty members exercise greater oversight of programs.\n\n\nNonladder — or non-tenure-track — faculty deliver about half of the curriculum at the Divinity School, said McKanan, who has a nonladder contract and has been at Harvard for 17 years. “When Harvard chooses to rely on nonladder faculty,” he said, “it becomes a little bit strange and unnatural to exclude that half of the faculty from program leadership and from sponsoring public events on issues of urgent public concern.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Rubio Is Pressing to Open Sanctions Investigation Into Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/politics/rubio-is-pressing-to-open-sanctions-investigation-into-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(More weaponization of the federal government, err “Trump administration’s whole-of-government approach to bringing the Ivy League university to heel.”)\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is pushing to investigate whether Harvard University violated federal sanctions by collaborating on a health insurance conference in China that may have included officials blacklisted by the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The New York Times.\n\n\nMr. Trump and his allies appear determined [hell-bent] to upend nearly all aspects of the institution, which has long symbolized the pinnacle of higher learning in the country and attracted influential scholars from around the globe.\n\n(And here we see the fingerprints of the Manhattan Institute)\n\nStill, the X.P.C.C.’s involvement in the conference only recently gained attention from Trump allies, after a report about Harvard’s links to China published on April 22 by Strategy Risks, a New York-based intelligence company specializing in corporate exposure to China. The report was funded by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank that has advised Republican policymakers.\n\n\nNYTimes: What Happens if ‘Harvard Is Not Harvard’?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/harvard-funding-trump-administration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n“Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” school officials wrote in a lawsuit asking a judge to stop the federal government’s actions.\n\n\nIt left unsaid what Harvard, if it were no longer Harvard, would become.\n\n\nBut without federal dollars or international talent, experts say, Harvard could fall out of the top tier for research, where it currently sits with competitors like Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. By sheer dollars spent, its research budget could shrink to something similar to that of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, which spent just over $800 million on research in 2023, roughly half of what Harvard spends now.\n\n\nHarvard could choose to negotiate. But inside the university, officials appear reluctant to do that, given the backlash they could face for capitulating to Mr. Trump. This spring, the university took out $750 million in debt, giving it some cash flow as court decisions play out.\n\n\nThe atmosphere is particularly tense inside the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which relies on federal funding for 46 percent of its budget and has a student body that is about 40 percent international. Senior officials there are planning for the worst, and have called the potential changes an “existential crisis” for the school’s future.\n\n\nBut Harvard’s biggest source of funding is donations and payouts from its endowment, which together make up 45 percent of its revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Indiana U., Professors Spar With Administrators Over Nighttime Protests\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/at-indiana-u-professors-spar-with-administrators-over-nighttime-protests\n\nUnder a policy passed in response to a monthslong pro-Palestinian encampment at Indiana, certain forms of “expressive activity” — including holding protests, making speeches, and circulating petitions — were banned on campus between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Administrators argued that the changes were necessary to ensure safety after the encampment got out of hand.\n\n\nThe policy banned protests between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., required 10-day prior approval for installing “structures and/or mass physical objects,” and pushed protests 25 feet away from building entrances.\n\n\nStudents and staff sued over the policy. In late May, a federal judge temporarily blocked the nighttime restrictions.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the political climate surrounding the university remains contentious. Last week, Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, removed the three alumni-elected trustees from Indiana’s board — including two who voted against the expressive-activity policy — and replaced them with conservatives, including a prominent lawyer and a former ESPN anchor.\n\n\nTexas lawmakers just approved legislation broadly banning “any speech or expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment” between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. at public universities. The measure now awaits the governor’s signature.\n\n\nBut Indiana’s expressive-activity policy never specified how many nighttime protesters were too many. That meant even a protest involving two people — unlikely to be a threat to public safety — would require prior approval, the judge said in her order granting the preliminary injunction.\n\n\nWhile the decision was far from “novel or surprising,” it will hopefully send a message to universities imposing similar policies that “the courts are not going to put up with this kind of similarly open violation of the First Amendment and so they probably shouldn’t try it,” said Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the George Washington University Law School.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Administration Proposes Cutting Tribal College Funds by Nearly 90% — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/tribal-colleges-universities-trump-cuts-funding\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed cutting funding for tribal colleges and universities by nearly 90%, a move that would likely shut down most or all of the institutions created to serve students disadvantaged by the nation’s historic mistreatment of Indigenous communities.\n\n\nThe document mentions only the two federally controlled tribal colleges — Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute — but notes the request for postsecondary programs will drop from more than $182 million this year to just over $22 million for 2026.\n\n\nInside UNC’s Effort to Launch a New Accreditor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/accreditation/2025/06/06/emails-shed-light-uncs-plans-create-new-accreditor\n\nLast month, Peter Hans, president of the University of North Carolina system, casually dropped a bombshell announcement that the system and others were in talks to launch a new accreditor.\n\n\n“We’ve been having a number of discussions with several other major public university systems, where we’re exploring the idea of creating an accreditor that would offer sound oversight,” Hans said at a UNC system Board of Governors meeting last month, The News & Observer reported.\n\n\nhave been quietly engaged in conversations about launching a new accreditor for at least a year, including discussions with unnamed collaborators in Florida, where the effort could be headquartered. UNC officials have also spoken with officials at the U.S. Department of Education, even getting a heads-up on what an April 23 executive order from the Trump administration on accreditation would entail.\n\n\n“Everything Florida has done on accreditation over the past few years appears to be politically and ideologically driven, rather than about what is best for students and ensuring that they go to high-quality institutions and get a good education when they’re paying a lot of money for it and when taxpayers are investing a lot of money in public funding for higher education,” he said [Edward Conroy, a senior policy manager at the left-leaning think tank New America].\n\n\nConroy worries that state lawmakers in either Florida or North Carolina would require public colleges in their state to be accredited by their new accreditor. That would undermine the current requirement that colleges get to choose their own accreditor.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard, Duke, Stanford and other wealthy universities are hoping to avoid a huge potential tax hike by pitching an alternative plan to Congress: a pledge to spend more of their own money\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/colleges-hope-to-stave-off-big-tax-hike-by-pledging-to-spend-more-endowment-cash-353606fb?st=FTbBSQ&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(They will spend 5% of their endowments.

He should increase it.\n\n(He doesn’t, ed.)\n\nIf the United States wants to compete with other countries for manufacturing jobs, our best strategy is to leverage our exceptional university research capabilities to rebuild our manufacturing base.\n\n\nUniversities have long played pivotal roles in building world-class high-tech economies: Stanford University helped make Silicon Valley what it is today by fostering technological excellence in electrical engineering, establishing the Stanford Research Park and educating the founders of startups like Hewlett-Packard. Individuals from universities like M.I.T. and Harvard played central roles in transforming Boston from a center of textile and boot and shoe manufacturing to a health-sciences hub by starting the world’s first modern venture capital fund to commercialize academic research.\n\n\nCarnegie Mellon University helped revitalize Pittsburgh through targeted investments in computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics, coupled with strategic initiatives to bolster local entrepreneurship. The University of Texas at Austin mobilized local business and political leaders to transform Austin into a leading high-tech region. In all of these cases, universities led efforts to reposition their regional economies toward high-tech sectors such as computers, software, biotechnology and robotics.",

Sadly it is just too easy to make these digest too long to digest.\nThanks to BE, VAC, EI, EST, … for their contributions.\n\n\n\nSeveral CUNY senates have passed alliance resolutions\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/my5g55jprx5o64r4vzus0/ABqQBAimqk_KN5t-EsUG8Ds/1.Mutual%20Defense%20Statements?dl=0&rlkey=zvsqtp7ev781y4rqqjti8xaho&subfolder_nav_tracking=1\nThanks to EI for maintaining this list. New this week is John Jay\n\n\n\n\n‘At this point, we are a liberal democracy in decline’\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/05/larry-diamond-trump-america-democracy/\nInterview with Larry Diamond\n\nRight now, if you are not at a university, if you’re not at a law firm, if you are not a member of Congress who is getting death threats and warnings of political obliteration if you don’t vote in lockstep with the MAGA movement, if you are not a journalist getting abuse and potential exclusion from the government, if you’re not a career Foreign Service officer or a civil servant who has dedicated their lives to serving the country in nonpartisan fashion and you’re now being purged or fired — if you’re not any of those kinds of people, your life goes on, except maybe you’re paying higher prices or seeing your 401(k) fall because of Trump’s erratic policies on tariffs. So, you can say that, in terms of the loss of freedom, most people feel unaffected. But what we need to get our fellow citizens to see is that it’s all connected, and that when due process is undermined even for a noncitizen, ultimately it can put everyone’s freedom in jeopardy. What lessons do you draw from other countries such as Hungary, India, Poland, Brazil, the Philippines, Turkey and Venezuela, all of which have seen democratic backsliding over the past few decades?\n\n\n The lessons are that people should unify and coordinate as quickly as possible. The more that institutions under threat try to just go their own way or duck for cover, the more they’ll be divided and picked off one by one. The sooner that people rally in coordination and in principled defense of the Constitution and the rule of law, the better the prospect that they will be able to contain and reverse the authoritarian project.\n\n\nNYTimes: What Happened When Trump Altered the Deal With Law Firms and Universities\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/europe/what-happened-when-trump-altered-the-deal-with-law-firms-and-universities.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(In short, the prisoner’s dilemma doesn’t apply when negotiating with the mafia.)\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Battles Academia, but Especially the Ivy League\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/us/politics/trump-ivy-league.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nTimothy L. O’Brien, a biographer of Mr. Trump, said the president’s ire about the upper echelon of academia was not surprising. “He has a long track record of criticizing elites that he desperately wants to be accepted by,” Mr. O’Brien said. As far as the Ivy League, he said, “he could barely wait to get in himself.”\n\n(Not sure this is why; I personally believe things are related to a desire to control competing power bases.)\n\n\n\nPresident Trump fires Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden | AP News\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-library-of-congress-carla-hayden-20a1862ce6d2e0d51a84a37b264ce2ef\n\nNYTimes: Trump Declares High-Speed Internet Program ‘Racist’ and ‘Unconstitutional’\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/politics/trump-biden-digital-equity-act.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas lawmakers moving to greatly increase control of state universities\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4d48IaK\n\nConservative lawmakers, who control all levers of government, are advancing a measure they say would hold institutions more accountable and ensure curriculum is “free from ideological bias.” Faculty could be removed or face civil penalties for violations. Schools that fail to comply could be barred from spending state funds.\n\n\nOpponents say the result would essentially be a takeover of the state’s 126 public universities, community college districts and medical schools, with state officials even allowed to overturn hiring decisions. They fear it could damage the institutions’ reputations and lead to a faculty brain drain.\n\n\nHis (Brandon Creighton) new proposal aims to decrease the power of faculty senates, requiring that half of their members be appointed by school presidents. All would be term-limited, advisory only and removable by top administrators for “political advocacy.”\n\n\nAnother provision would give the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board — composed of nine gubernatorial appointees — the ultimate say in faculty and academic screening. The board would pay special attention to schools’ required core curriculum, to ensure they “do not require or attempt to require a student to adopt a belief that any race, sex, or ethnicity or social, political, or religious belief is inherently superior.”\n\n\nComplaints lodged against professors would be investigated by a new state ombudsman and the attorney general, currently Ken Paxton (R), an ultraconservative Trump ally.\n\n\n“Texas is as broad-reaching a legislative endeavor as we’ve seen,” he (Professor Peter Lake, Stetson University) said. And combined with Trump’s attacks on higher education, the legislation is likely to “embolden red states to experiment with even more control over institutional autonomy, right down to curriculum, hiring and firing, tenure, curriculum review.”\n\n\nUT System Chancellor James B. Milliken also is departing after seven years to become president of the University of California.\n\n\nNew State Laws Target DEI, Struggling Academic Programs, and Tenure\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/new-state-laws-target-dei-struggling-academic-programs-and-tenure\n\n“It fits into a picture with many, many aspects of attempts to control higher education and intellectual and academic freedom,” said Risa Lieberwitz, a professor of labor and employment law at Cornell University and a member of the American Association of University Professors’ committee on academic freedom and tenure.\n\nStates mentioned: Arkansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Wyoming, Kentucky, North Dakota, and Utah.

Several students were also suspended for violating their college’s policies and protest restrictions.\n\n(This does not include 12 people arrested at Brooklyn College Thursday night)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/nyregion/protest-brooklyn-college-arrests.html\n\nThe police moved in to make arrests after demonstrators left the college grounds and gathered outside.

Officers punched some students and slammed others to the ground.\n\n\nA police spokesman said college officials had requested that the police respond to the campus shortly before 5 p.m. A precise number of arrests was not available Thursday evening.

The measure, known as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, broke a decades-long impasse between congressional Republicans and Democrats on addressing gun violence by focusing largely on improving mental health support for students.\n\n\nTRIO on the Chopping Block\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/retention/2025/05/07/how-trumps-proposed-trio-cuts-could-hamper-college-access\n\nThe Trump administration wants to eliminate the federally funded student support program. That could be devastating for low-income students and the institutions that serve them.\n\n\nHe [sample impacted student] credits his success at Bemidji to TRIO, a federally funded initiative dating back to the 1960s that supports low-income, first-generation college students and students with disabilities as they navigate academic life—and that currently faces an existential threat from the Trump administration.\n\n\n“Today, the pendulum has swung and access to college is not the obstacle it was for students of limited means,” officials wrote in the proposal [Trump budget opening salvo]. “A renewed focus on academics and scholastic accomplishment by [institutions], rather than engaging in woke ideology with federal taxpayer subsidies, would be a welcome change.”\n\n\n\n\nACE’s summary of “STUDENT SUCCESS AND TAXPAYER SAVINGS PLAN” that moves to the House Budget Committee (thanks CMR)\n\nhttps://www.acenet.edu/Documents/Summary-Student-Success-Taxpayer-Savings-Plan.pdf\n(Yes, the name shows the crazy stretching of the all-too elastic phrase “student success”)\nIt includes: Pell Grant restrictions; Loan program eliminations; New repayment plan; Risk-sharing requirement; Regulatory constraints.\nKey parts for Pell\n\nChanges full-time status from 24 semester hours or 36 quarter credit hours to 30 semester hours or 45 quarter credit hours;\n\n(From 12 to 15 credits for CUNY making full time much more out of reach for many of our students)\n\nRequiring that a student who applies for federal student aid be a citizen or a national of the United States or be an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act; and\n\n\nThese provisions would take effect on July 1, 2025, and apply to the 2025-2026 academic year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Trump’s Proposed Budget Cuts Mean for Education, Research (aims to cut at least $163 billion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/05/02/trump-proposes-deep-cuts-education-and-research\n(I’d argue even phrasing this as a planned cut, rather than merely an assault is a mistake, but….)\n\nThe proposed budget plan slashes nearly $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health, $12 billion from the Education Department and nearly $5 billion from the National Science Foundation. The skinny budget also eliminates funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, AmeriCorps, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has already made deep cuts at those agencies and put most—if not all—of their employees on leave.\n\n\nTo compensate for the cuts to programs that directly support students or institutions, the administration argued colleges, states and local communities should on take that responsibility. Other justifications for the cuts reflect the administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and higher ed.\n\n(Again, “crackdown” is far too fair a term here.)\n\nAdditionally, the administration wants to cut the Office for Civil Rights’ budget by $49 million, or 35 percent. The budget document says this cut will refocus OCR “away from DEI and Title IX transgender cases.” In recent years, the Biden administration pleaded with Congress to boost OCR’s funding in order to address an increasing number of complaints. The office received 22,687 complaints in fiscal year 2024, and the Biden administration projected that number to grow to nearly 24,000 in 2025.\n\n\n“The budget cuts funding for: climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and programs in low priority areas of science,” the officials wrote in budget documents. “NSF has fueled research with dubious public value, like speculative impacts from extreme climate scenarios and niche social studies.”\n\n(There is too much there to even unpack; I’ll just note that this was preceded by “we must change course and reorient taxpayer dollars toward proven programs that generate results for American students.”)\n\nThe plan would consolidate NIH programs into five areas: the National Institute on Body Systems Research, the National Institute on Neuroscience and Brain Research, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Institute of Disability Related Research, and the National Institute on Behavioral Health.\n\n\n“The administration is committed to restoring accountability, public trust, and transparency at the NIH,” officials wrote. “NIH has broken the trust of the American people with wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.”\n\n(More nonsense in this “skinny budget”)\n\n\n\n\nUnder Trump, National Science Foundation Cuts Off All Funding to Scientists | Scientific American\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01396-2\n(Only until further notice, as if law breakers mean what they write)\n\nThe policy prevents the NSF, one of the world’s biggest supporters of basic research, from awarding new research grants and from supplying allotted funds for existing grants, such as those that receive yearly increments of money. The email does not provide a reason for the freeze and says that it will last “until further notice”.\n\n\nTrump Halts Grants, Caps Indirect Costs at the National Science Foundation\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-halts-grants-caps-indirect-costs-at-the-national-science-foundation\n\nUniversities Sue NSF Over Indirect Research Cost Policy\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/07/universities-sue-nsf-over-indirect-research-cost-policy\n\nPlaintiffs in the lawsuit include the American Council on Education, the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and 13 universities, including Arizona State University, the University of Chicago and Princeton University.\n\n\nThey attest that the NSF violated numerous aspects of the Administrative Procedure Act, including bypassing Congress to unilaterally institute an “arbitrary and capricious” 15 percent rate cap and failing to explain why it’s only imposing the policy on universities.\n\n\nThe NSF awarded $6.7 billion to some 621 universities in 2023.\n\n\nExclusive: NSF faces radical shake-up as officials abolish its 37 divisions | Science | AAAS\n\nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/exclusive-nsf-faces-radical-shake-officials-abolish-its-37-divisions\n\n[The NSF] is plunging into deeper turmoil. According to sources who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, staff were told today that the agency’s 37 divisions—across all eight NSF directorates—are being abolished and the number of programs within those divisions will be drastically reduced. The current directors and deputy directors will lose their titles and might be reassigned to other positions at the agency or elsewhere in the federal government.\n\n\nThe consolidation appears to be driven in part by President Donald Trump’s proposal to cut the agency’s $9 billion budget by 55% for the 2026 fiscal year that begins on 1 October.\n\n\nThe agency is also expected to issue another round of notices tomorrow terminating grants that have already been awarded, sources say. In the past 3 weeks, the agency has pulled the plug on almost 1400 grants worth more than $1 billion.\n\n(CSI faculty were among these who lost funding this week.)\n\n\n\n\nLawsuit Against Humanities Endowment Offers Details on DOGE - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/arts/humanities-endowment-doge-grants.html\n\nEmployees from the Department of Government Efficiency started visiting the office soon after, according to the lawsuit. Citing accounts by former or current staff members at the endowment, the lawsuit says that two DOGE employees, Nate Cavanaugh and Justin Fox, asked for a list of all current grants and then “indiscriminately terminated the vast majority” on April 2. Nearly 1,500 grant recipients received cancellation letters that suggested their projects were not in keeping with “the president’s agenda.”\n\n\nThree weeks later, the agency announced it would be redirecting [stealing ed.] $17 million of its funding to create the National Garden of American Heroes,\n\n\nThe lawsuit contends that those moves violate the Constitution, which reserves the power of the purse for Congress, and also the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\nTrump proposes eliminating the NEA and NEH as arts grants are canceled\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/05/03/trump-budget-nea-neh-eliminate/\n(This applies going forward, the lawsuit applies to past allocations. But the keyword is “proposed”, as this was just part of the Trumpian fantasy budget.)\n\nNYTimes: The National Endowment for the Arts Begins Terminating Grants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/arts/national-endowment-for-the-arts-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nGuidance from MAA (https://www.medievalacademy.org/; thanks EST for sharing)\n\n(This appeared in a news letter, so no link is available)\n\nWith the caveat that the MAA cannot offer actual legal advice, here is the current state of affairs, as we understand it:\n\n\n\nACLS, AHA, and MLA have filed a lawsuit against the NEH and DOGE. The complaint is online here. The suit is likely to proceed quickly, and we will keep you apprised of its progress.\n\n\n\n\nA court decision handed down earlier this week compels the government to restore terminated IMLS funding. I am hopeful that this success will serve as a strong precedent for other suits.\n\n\n\n\nThose who have lost NEH funding should have filed an appeal by now, either as an individual or through their host institution. If you have not done so, the guidance we’ve received is that you should file anyway before taking any further action, following whatever guidelines you have received (and with the understanding that there is, in fact, no truly clear guidance about what is happening at NEH). More information on the appeals process can be found here. When appealing any grant termination, be sure to emphasize how this loss may impact not only your research but your reputation, opportunities passed up to take on the grant-funded project, and the loss of future opportunities that the grant might have made possible. Please remember that our colleagues at NEH – those who remain – are devastated by the current situation and are themselves overwhelmed. They are committed Federal employees who are not to blame for these terminations. I urge you to try to be patient as your appeal (and the lawsuit) move forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment of Transportation, NEA Cut Federal Grants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/05/department-transportation-nea-cut-federal-grants\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy announced Friday that the Department of Transportation eliminated seven “woke university grants,” totaling $54 million.\n\nincluding:\n\nabout $9 million to City College of New York’s Center for Social and Economic Mobility for People and Communities through Transportation,\n\n\nThe department also cut a $6 million grant to New York University to fund research on “e-bikes to low-income travelers in transit deserts”\n\n\nHundreds of recipients of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts also received notice Friday (May 2) that their funding had been withdrawn or terminated, NPR reported.\n\n\nAccording to the email, Trump’s priorities include “projects that elevate the Nation’s HBCUs and Hispanic Serving Institutions, celebrate the 250th anniversary of American independence, foster AI competency, empower houses of worship to serve communities, assist with disaster recovery, foster skilled trade jobs, make America healthy again, support the military and veterans, support Tribal communities, make the District of Columbia safe and beautiful, and support the economic development of Asian American communities.”\n\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts rescinds grants, dazing publishers and theaters\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater/2025/05/04/trump-budget-nea-arts-grants-canceled/\n(dazing: make someone unable to think or react properly; stupefy; bewilder.)\n\nEvery arts director at the NEA exits federal culture agency\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/05/07/nea-staff-departure/\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration will put millions of defaulted student-loan borrowers into collections starting Monday and is threatening to confiscate their wages and federal benefits\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/student-loans-debt-payments-collections-6fd28ed3?st=fgHqWY&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nTrump administration to resume collection on student loans in default : NPR\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/04/21/nx-s1-5371723/trump-administration-collections-on-defaulted-student-loans\n\nEducation Department Rolls Back Decades of Civil Rights Progress Under Trump — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/education-department-civil-rights-donald-trump-discrimination\n\nHollowed Out: The administration has closed Education Department civil rights offices and fired workers. Now, investigating discrimination in schools is practically “impossible.”\n\n\nIn South Dakota, the OCR abruptly terminated its work with a school district that had agreed to take steps to end discrimination against its Native American students. The same office that helped craft the agreement to treat indigenous students equally made a stunning about-face and decided in March that helping Native American students would discriminate against white students.\n\n\nOne OCR attorney, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, told ProPublica that their caseload went from 60 to 380 as they absorbed cases previously handled by employees who worked in offices that had been closed.\n\n\n“OCR is the most useless it’s ever been, and it’s the most dangerous it’s ever been. And by useless, I mean unavailable. Unable to do the work,”\n\n\nInvestigating cases that allege racism, discrimination based on sexual orientation or mistreatment of students with disabilities now requires permission from Trump appointees, according to a memo from OCR leadership. As a result, thousands of discrimination investigations are idled, even ones that were nearing a resolution when Trump took office again.\n\n\nInvestigations being publicized now have largely bypassed the agency’s civil rights attorneys, according to Education Department employees. McMahon and OCR head Craig Trainor created what amounts to a shadow division.\n\n(This article is really a gut punch, but well worth reading)\n\nEducation Dept.

So too must be the student body, staff and leadership. A failing grade, the letter warned, would result in corrective measures, including the deliberate recruiting of “a critical mass” of new faculty and students to correct the imbalance.\n\n\nHarvard has rejected the Trump administration’s demands, calling them a threat to academic freedom and the political independence of higher education. But in a letter to Harvard affiliates informing them that the university was suing the government, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, echoed that vocabulary.\n\n\n“We acknowledge that we have unfinished business,” Dr. Garber wrote. “We need to ensure that the university lives up to its steps to reaffirm a culture of free inquiry, viewpoint diversity and academic exploration.”\n\n\nHarvard itself has been a hotbed of diverse views about the value of viewpoint diversity and its relationship to the bedrock value of academic freedom. But there’s broad agreement that the Trump administration is weaponizing the term — which its letter never defines — in a dangerous way.\n\n\nThe term viewpoint diversity began gaining currency across academia largely through the efforts of Heterodox Academy, a nonpartisan national group founded in 2015 to combat what it describes as “the rise of closed-minded orthodoxies within scholarly communities.”\n\n\nIn recent years, it has been picked up by Republican politicians, as a new tool to support their longstanding argument that universities have been taken over by the left.\n\n\nA report last October by the free expression group PEN America said that viewpoint diversity, while a laudable goal, has too often served as “camouflage” for the real purpose: stifling faculty members’ speech.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Disqualifies Harvard From Future Research Grants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/trump-harvard-research-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThe letter is as they say meshuga\nhttps://x.com/EDSecMcMahon/status/1919517481313427594\nMy favorite is to now blame it on the math\n\nWhy is it, we ask, that Harvard has to teach simple and basic mathematics, when it is supposedly so hard to get into this “acclaimed university”? Who is getting in under such a low standard when others, with fabulous grades and a great understanding of the highest levels of mathematics, are being rejected?\n\nWhen the NY Times calls this “a contentious letter” they are only sane washing it. It might better be described by an AI prompt “write crazy letter on Harvard in the voice of the president, include all specious claims”\n\nDeciphering the Trump Administration’s Latest Letter to Harvard\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/05/07/experts-unpack-linda-mcmahons-latest-letter-harvard\nInsidehighered found one Project 2025 voice here:\n\n“When the secretary says, ‘Don’t come to us for grants anymore,’ she means that, and she can enforce it,” said Adam Kissel, a visiting fellow in the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Education Policy. “The tone suggests that Harvard really needs to wake up and understand the dire nature of its situation.”\n\nBut by and large, this is the take they find\n\nBut Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, described Monday’s letter as a “particularly disturbing” and “unwarranted escalation of threats.” What the Trump administration has done since day one, Pasquerella said, is launch a “politically motivated attack, not only against Harvard, but higher education as a whole,” and it’s all part of a long-standing Republican playbook.\n\n\nMultiple Inside Higher Ed sources have described the Trump administration’s approach to higher education as “fascist” or “authoritarian,” and Pasquerella even noted that the White House has positioned Viktor Orbán—Hungary’s right-wing prime minister who has long been known for his assault on academic freedom—as someone to emulate.\n\n\n“The president is so bombastic and so over-the-top that it’s hard for me to see gradations,” Hess [director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank] said. “So, sure, the secretary sending a letter that declared ‘don’t bother applying for anything’ is an extraordinary declaration. And in other circumstances, I would have been like, holy cow. But given what the administration has done over the past three and a half months, it’s not clear to me that it changes the administration’s posture.”\n\n\nTrump administration calls for a freeze on all new grants to Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/05/harvard-new-grants-freeze-trump/\n\nMcMahon’s letter displays an astonishing and frankly disqualifying level of ignorance — about Harvard, about how federal research funding works, and about the plain text of the U.S. Constitution,” Weld (AAUP President of Harvard chapter) said. “The entire higher ed sector must reject this crude authoritarianism with one voice.”\n\n\nTed Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, said, “I think we should all be looking at the interchange between the department, Harvard and the White House as harbingers of things to come.” \n\n\nLarry Summers, former president of Harvard, said the Trump administration’s fight with the Ivy League university has larger implications for civil society. “This is about whether the government has the power to coerce private institutions, using all the various authorities it has to advance particular political agendas of the president,” he said. “But for higher education, this is about academic freedom, which for the better part of a century, the Supreme Court recognized as intimately connected to the First Amendment. So in a broad civic sense, it’s about our commitment to constitutional democracy as manifest in the First Amendment.”\n\n\nTrump Finally Drops the Anti-Semitism Pretext – The latest letter to Harvard makes clear that the administration’s goal is to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal. (Thanks BE for the sharing and the gift link!)\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/mcmahon-harvard-letter/682717/?gift=yCYg0MdUGpnvquf3En3lpkKQKFBhGvbst4TkhNQ1SSk&utm_source=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=social\n(A critique that doesn’t sanewash and well worth reading)\n\nThe intensely hostile letter that Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent to the leadership of Harvard yesterday has a lot going on. But the most notable thing about it is what it leaves out.\n\n\nTo hear McMahon tell it, Harvard is a university on the verge of ruin. (I say McMahon because her signature is at the bottom of the letter, but portions of the document are written in such a distinctive idiolect—“Why is there so much HATE?” the letter asks; it signs off with “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”—that one detects the spirit of a certain uncredited co-author.)\n\n\nWhat you will not find in the McMahon letter is any mention of the original justification for the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on elite universities: anti-Semitism.\n\n\nNow, however, the mask is off. Aside from one oblique reference to congressional hearings about anti-Semitism (“the great work of Congresswoman Elise Stefanik”), the letter is silent on the subject. The administration is no longer pretending that it is standing up for Jewish students. The project has been revealed for what it is: an effort to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal.\n\n\n“There’s no ‘We don’t like you’ authority in the federal Constitution or in statutory law. In fact, quite the opposite: You’re precluded from that.” [Derek Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina]\n\n\nHarvard Faculty Pledge 10% of Their Salary to Defend Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/06/harvard-faculty-pledge-10-salary-defend-against-trump\n\nNearly 100 senior faculty members at Harvard have committed to taking a pay cut to support the institution’s legal defense against the federal government.\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Leaders See Only Bad Outcomes Ahead as They Battle Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/harvard-trump-court-case-negotiation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut behind the scenes, several senior officials at Harvard and on its top governing board believe that the university is confronting a crisis that could last until President Trump is out of power, according to three people involved in the discussions. Even if Harvard’s legal case is successful, these officials say, the school will still face enormous troubles that may force the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university to rethink its identity and scale.\n\nSo says\n\nThey spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss school officials’ private deliberations.\n\n\nThe crosscurrents are unlike any that the university has faced in its modern history. For centuries, Harvard has cherished its independence, its swaggering pride and its record of academic excellence. But Mr. Trump has reveled in unleashing chaos that many believe will be difficult to contain as long as he sees the university as a target.\n\n\nThe corporation [the board that oversees the university] has told the school’s lawyers not to engage with the Trump administration, according to the two people involved in discussions.\n\n\nComplicating matters is whether the White House will honor a deal.\n\n\nLawrence H. Summers, a former Harvard president, said … “It would be a tragedy if Harvard resolved this in a way that gave support and encouragement to the idea of extralegal extortion.”\n\n\nThe Trump administration this week reiterated its aim to inflict as much damage as possible, when Ms. McMahon fired off a letter telling Harvard that it would not receive future federal grants. Although experts on government contracts and grants scoffed at the missive, the government can essentially blacklist contractors through a process called debarment.\n\n\nAside from the research funding, there will be nothing to stop the administration from saddling the school with more onerous and potentially costly investigations, like the ones currently being conducted by at least five different departments and agencies, including the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Orders to Investigate Columbia Protesters Raised Alarms in Justice Dept.

I did so because the letter represents an authoritarian threat to science, and I knew it wasn’t an isolated, bizarre incident. It is a warning sign, another move in a broader campaign to exert control over research, medicine and media.\n\n\nThe letter asserts that “publications like CHEST Journal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates.” It was written by recently appointed acting U.S. attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr., who gives no examples that might demonstrate partisanship; nor does he cite any laws or legal principles to indicate a matter that should concern the U.S. government.\n\n\nSince I publicly shared this, at least four additional journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, have confirmed receipt of similar letters, according to MedPage Today, STAT News, the New York Times and Science. Aside from Eric Rubin at the NEJM, none of the targeted editors have been willing to go on record, fearing retribution from the Trump administration.\n\n\nWhy CHEST? It’s a specialty outlet—not even among the top 50 medical journals. Is this a keyword-driven campaign like those we’ve seen at the CDC and NIH? Under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., terms like “diversity,” “minority” and “equity” have been systematically flagged.\n\n\nKennedy frequently makes evidence-free claims on podcasts and television shows and now in government press conferences, regardless of the consequences. However, peer-reviewed journals like CHEST require extensive scrutiny as part of their evaluation process.\n\n\nHow a Decades-Old Diversity Program Became Collateral Damage in Trump’s Anti-DEI Crusade\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-a-decades-old-diversity-program-became-collateral-damage-in-trumps-anti-dei-crusade\n\nThe PhD Project has for three decades encouraged business professionals from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue doctorates in the discipline. For years, its work was seen as uncontroversial; its annual conference introduced midcareer business professionals of color to the academy, offering resources and a support network to those interested in switching jobs. Eventually, some of those prospective students would become professors themselves, helping diversify a traditionally homogenous discipline.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Congress Grills College Presidents With an Old Script and New Threats\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/congress-hearing-college-presidents-haverford.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUnder Republicans’ Scrutiny, College Presidents Apologize for Their Handling of Campus Antisemitism\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/under-republicans-scrutiny-college-presidents-apologize-for-their-handling-of-campus-antisemitism\n\nA three-hour-long hearing on Wednesday once again gave House Republicans the opportunity to amplify reports of antisemitic social-media posts, events, and confrontations, and to demand that institutions provide information on how they discipline students and faculty members who transgress.\n\n\nBut lawmakers seeking to make a point had material to work with. The three campuses all saw pro-Palestinian protests and alleged incidents of antisemitic harassment following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.\n\n\nWednesday’s hearing marked yet another expansion of Republicans’ efforts to put higher ed under pressure. Since January, the Trump administration has canceled or frozen grants at several prominent research universities, largely for alleged failures to combat antisemitism.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: On California’s State Bar Exam, More Questions Than Answers\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/california-state-bar-exam.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThen came the news that at least a handful of the multiple-choice questions had been developed with the help of artificial intelligence. To many of those who took the exam, it was hardly shocking — they already had suspicions that A.I. had been used, based on a few questions that they said had struck them as bizarrely worded or legally unsound.\n\n\nKaplan, the new contractor for exam development, disputed that the study guide contained a significant number of errors.\n\n\nthe State Bar of California said in a statement. “We apologize again, and we make no excuses for the failures that have occurred.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior State Department official sought internal communications with journalists, European officials, and Trump critics | MIT Technology Review\n\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/01/1115988/senior-state-department-official-sought-internal-communications-with-journalists-european-officials-and-trump-critics/\n\nFried echoes this sentiment. “I spent 40 years in the State Department, and you didn’t collect names or demand email records,” says Fried. “I’ve never heard of such a thing”—at least not in the American context, he clarifies. It did remind him of Eastern European “Communist Party minder[s] watching over the untrusted bureaucracy.”\n\n\nHe adds: “It also approaches the compilation of an enemies list.”\n\n\nCal Poly, DePaul and Haverford Head to Capitol Hill\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/executive-leadership/2025/05/07/cal-poly-depaul-and-haverford-head-capitol-hill\n\nThis time, lawmakers are targeting California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo; DePaul University; and Haverford College. Presidents from all three institutions will testify at a congressional hearing today.\n\n\nIn all three letters, the Republican-led Committee on Education and the Workforce cited alleged instances of antisemitism and noted failing grades on the Anti-Defamation League’s Campus Antisemitism Report Card: Both DePaul and Haverford received an F, while Cal Poly earned a D.\n\n(Put aside a committee that conflates a D with failing and perhaps worry that Hunter has a “C” grade and could be up soon by these standards.)\n\nHigher Education Leaders Call for Greater Defense of Board Independence\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/07/higher-ed-leaders-call-defense-board-independence\n(Reports on this letter https://agb.org/news/letters-and-testimony/community-letter-reaffirming-the-independence-of-higher-education-governance-a-call-to-action/)\n\nAmerican higher education leaders, advocates and stakeholders must stand together to “defend the autonomy of college and university governing boards as a cornerstone of constitutional freedoms; and reject political interference that undermines academic excellence and fiduciary stewardship,” the group said.\n\n\nThey also called for leaders to reaffirm the principles of institutional autonomy laid out in the 1819 Supreme Court decision Dartmouth College v. Woodward, which established safeguards to protect colleges from ideological and political interference.\n\n\nThe chairs of the boards of trustees at Clark Atlanta University, Eastern Michigan University and the University of Illinois are among the signatories, as well as the heads of the Middle States and New England Commissions of Higher Education.\n\n\nLawmakers in several states have introduced legislation that seeks to increase board oversight in processes like academic programming and tenure, as well as a governor’s ability to appoint board members.\n\n\nA Looming Crisis for Public Colleges: If the federal government cuts Medicaid spending, state funding for higher ed will evaporate.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-looming-crisis-for-public-colleges\n\nThe House Republicans’ plan for reconciliation includes a cut of about $880 billion over the next decade in health-care and energy spending and $230 billion from agriculture. A budget reduction of this magnitude will require significant reductions to Medicaid and SNAP.\n\n\nThat would directly harm low- and moderate-income Americans across the country, but these costs will also be passed on to states, putting pressure on already-tight budgets. And, as history has shown us time and time again, a state-budget squeeze almost always leads to skyrocketing college costs and lower-quality public education.\n\n\nMost states are required to pass balanced budgets each year. But some programs, like Medicaid, are directly tied to formulas and federal matching dollars. When revenue is tight, especially in tough economic times, states reduce the portion of their total budgets that remain “discretionary” — the portion that is not dictated by formula-derived expenses.  In almost every state, higher education is the largest discretionary-spending category.\n\n\nFor just one example, look to Pennsylvania, where I [Tanya I. Garcia] previously served as deputy secretary and commissioner for postsecondary and higher education. For the 30-year period from financial year 1991 to financial year 2021, Pennsylvania increased Medicaid spending by 227 percent and decreased higher-education spending by 28 percent.\n\n\nWhen state funding for higher education drops, it affects open-access, less-selective colleges the most, since they are more dependent on state appropriations and less able to raise their prices than their peers at elite public and flagship institutions. This is a crucial distinction, as 86 percent of all undergraduate students pursuing a degree in the United States do not attend selective flagships or research universities.\n\n\nMake no mistake: Such massive federal funding cuts would unleash mayhem on state budgets and public colleges starved for resources. Almost 40 states will have finalized their budgets by June 30 of this year. Will we have a raft of states calling special legislative sessions to revise their budgets when all is said and done in the nation’s capital? We still have time to avoid this.\n\n\nNYTimes: I Know Trump’s Plan for Universities. It Transformed My College.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/opinion/trump-universities-woke.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMr. Trump has been watching what’s transpired in Florida. The architect of Project 2025’s education policies has said that Florida is “leading the way” on university overhauls. Already, Mr. Trump has threatened to pull funding from colleges that don’t purge language he considers woke. He’s demanded new oversight of certain regional studies departments. Next he could try to ban, as Florida has, “political or social activism.” He could weaken the protections provided by tenure and faculty unions. I saw this happen on my campus, and I know the toll it took. If the Trump administration has its way, my experience could offer a preview of what’s coming for other universities.\n\n\nSince Mr. DeSantis’s crackdown, I’ve seen my colleagues harassed and investigated for addressing topical issues, even outside the classroom. The climate of fear gives the government precisely the result it wants. Administrators and faculty members alike practice anticipatory obedience to avoid even the appearance of wokeness, stifling the sort of open and civil discussions that lead students to develop their own views.\n\n\nSeveral professors have been subjected to efforts at entrapment. Last year a man posing as a student tried to encourage Muslim faculty members to criticize Mr. DeSantis and Israel. A similar incident happened to me. … That incident shattered my conviction that if I did my job well and followed the rules, I would be safe.\n\n\nTeaching is, above all, the creation of a community in the classroom, a web of trust and curiosity that binds students and instructors in a shared intellectual project. Mistrust, fear and self-censorship make that project impossible.\n\n\nNYTimes: West Point Is Supposed to Educate, Not Indoctrinate\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/opinion/west-point-trump-military.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Very good summary of how academic freedom is taken away overnight)\n\n\n\n\nChronicle of Higher Education\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda\nAlso this one on the “dismantling” of DEI\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-higher-eds-dismantling-of-dei\n\nWe Are Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.wearehighered.org/\n(This was mentioned in the NY Times article on the Rutgers “alliance” resolution and allows people to contribute, https://www.wearehighered.org/contact)\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

So, you can say that, in terms of the loss of freedom, most people feel unaffected. But what we need to get our fellow citizens to see is that it’s all connected, and that when due process is undermined even for a noncitizen, ultimately it can put everyone’s freedom in jeopardy. What lessons do you draw from other countries such as Hungary, India, Poland, Brazil, the Philippines, Turkey and Venezuela, all of which have seen democratic backsliding over the past few decades?\n\n\n The lessons are that people should unify and coordinate as quickly as possible. The more that institutions under threat try to just go their own way or duck for cover, the more they’ll be divided and picked off one by one.

Schools that fail to comply could be barred from spending state funds.\n\n\nOpponents say the result would essentially be a takeover of the state’s 126 public universities, community college districts and medical schools, with state officials even allowed to overturn hiring decisions. They fear it could damage the institutions’ reputations and lead to a faculty brain drain.\n\n\nHis (Brandon Creighton) new proposal aims to decrease the power of faculty senates, requiring that half of their members be appointed by school presidents. All would be term-limited, advisory only and removable by top administrators for “political advocacy.”\n\n\nAnother provision would give the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board — composed of nine gubernatorial appointees — the ultimate say in faculty and academic screening. The board would pay special attention to schools’ required core curriculum, to ensure they “do not require or attempt to require a student to adopt a belief that any race, sex, or ethnicity or social, political, or religious belief is inherently superior.”\n\n\nComplaints lodged against professors would be investigated by a new state ombudsman and the attorney general, currently Ken Paxton (R), an ultraconservative Trump ally.\n\n\n“Texas is as broad-reaching a legislative endeavor as we’ve seen,” he (Professor Peter Lake, Stetson University) said. And combined with Trump’s attacks on higher education, the legislation is likely to “embolden red states to experiment with even more control over institutional autonomy, right down to curriculum, hiring and firing, tenure, curriculum review.”\n\n\nUT System Chancellor James B. Milliken also is departing after seven years to become president of the University of California.\n\n\nNew State Laws Target DEI, Struggling Academic Programs, and Tenure\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/new-state-laws-target-dei-struggling-academic-programs-and-tenure\n\n“It fits into a picture with many, many aspects of attempts to control higher education and intellectual and academic freedom,” said Risa Lieberwitz, a professor of labor and employment law at Cornell University and a member of the American Association of University Professors’ committee on academic freedom and tenure.\n\nStates mentioned: Arkansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Wyoming, Kentucky, North Dakota, and Utah.

Now researchers are crowdsourcing databases of suspended grants to shed light on what’s being lost.\n\n\nTrump Administration Cancels $1 Billion in Grants for Student Mental Health (VAC)\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/trump-mental-health-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Whereas Pope wannabees still can qualify for mental health benefits, presumably)\n\nLawmakers authorized the money in 2022 after a former student opened fire at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, killing 19 children and two teachers and injuring 17 others. The measure, known as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, broke a decades-long impasse between congressional Republicans and Democrats on addressing gun violence by focusing largely on improving mental health support for students.\n\n\nTRIO on the Chopping Block\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/retention/2025/05/07/how-trumps-proposed-trio-cuts-could-hamper-college-access\n\nThe Trump administration wants to eliminate the federally funded student support program. That could be devastating for low-income students and the institutions that serve them.\n\n\nHe [sample impacted student] credits his success at Bemidji to TRIO, a federally funded initiative dating back to the 1960s that supports low-income, first-generation college students and students with disabilities as they navigate academic life—and that currently faces an existential threat from the Trump administration.\n\n\n“Today, the pendulum has swung and access to college is not the obstacle it was for students of limited means,” officials wrote in the proposal [Trump budget opening salvo]. “A renewed focus on academics and scholastic accomplishment by [institutions], rather than engaging in woke ideology with federal taxpayer subsidies, would be a welcome change.”\n\n\n\n\nACE’s summary of “STUDENT SUCCESS AND TAXPAYER SAVINGS PLAN” that moves to the House Budget Committee (thanks CMR)\n\nhttps://www.acenet.edu/Documents/Summary-Student-Success-Taxpayer-Savings-Plan.pdf\n(Yes, the name shows the crazy stretching of the all-too elastic phrase “student success”)\nIt includes: Pell Grant restrictions; Loan program eliminations; New repayment plan; Risk-sharing requirement; Regulatory constraints.\nKey parts for Pell\n\nChanges full-time status from 24 semester hours or 36 quarter credit hours to 30 semester hours or 45 quarter credit hours;\n\n(From 12 to 15 credits for CUNY making full time much more out of reach for many of our students)\n\nRequiring that a student who applies for federal student aid be a citizen or a national of the United States or be an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act; and\n\n\nThese provisions would take effect on July 1, 2025, and apply to the 2025-2026 academic year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Trump’s Proposed Budget Cuts Mean for Education, Research (aims to cut at least $163 billion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/05/02/trump-proposes-deep-cuts-education-and-research\n(I’d argue even phrasing this as a planned cut, rather than merely an assault is a mistake, but….)\n\nThe proposed budget plan slashes nearly $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health, $12 billion from the Education Department and nearly $5 billion from the National Science Foundation. The skinny budget also eliminates funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, AmeriCorps, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has already made deep cuts at those agencies and put most—if not all—of their employees on leave.\n\n\nTo compensate for the cuts to programs that directly support students or institutions, the administration argued colleges, states and local communities should on take that responsibility. Other justifications for the cuts reflect the administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and higher ed.\n\n(Again, “crackdown” is far too fair a term here.)\n\nAdditionally, the administration wants to cut the Office for Civil Rights’ budget by $49 million, or 35 percent. The budget document says this cut will refocus OCR “away from DEI and Title IX transgender cases.” In recent years, the Biden administration pleaded with Congress to boost OCR’s funding in order to address an increasing number of complaints. The office received 22,687 complaints in fiscal year 2024, and the Biden administration projected that number to grow to nearly 24,000 in 2025.\n\n\n“The budget cuts funding for: climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and programs in low priority areas of science,” the officials wrote in budget documents. “NSF has fueled research with dubious public value, like speculative impacts from extreme climate scenarios and niche social studies.”\n\n(There is too much there to even unpack; I’ll just note that this was preceded by “we must change course and reorient taxpayer dollars toward proven programs that generate results for American students.”)\n\nThe plan would consolidate NIH programs into five areas: the National Institute on Body Systems Research, the National Institute on Neuroscience and Brain Research, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Institute of Disability Related Research, and the National Institute on Behavioral Health.\n\n\n“The administration is committed to restoring accountability, public trust, and transparency at the NIH,” officials wrote. “NIH has broken the trust of the American people with wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.”\n\n(More nonsense in this “skinny budget”)\n\n\n\n\nUnder Trump, National Science Foundation Cuts Off All Funding to Scientists | Scientific American\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01396-2\n(Only until further notice, as if law breakers mean what they write)\n\nThe policy prevents the NSF, one of the world’s biggest supporters of basic research, from awarding new research grants and from supplying allotted funds for existing grants, such as those that receive yearly increments of money. The email does not provide a reason for the freeze and says that it will last “until further notice”.\n\n\nTrump Halts Grants, Caps Indirect Costs at the National Science Foundation\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-halts-grants-caps-indirect-costs-at-the-national-science-foundation\n\nUniversities Sue NSF Over Indirect Research Cost Policy\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/07/universities-sue-nsf-over-indirect-research-cost-policy\n\nPlaintiffs in the lawsuit include the American Council on Education, the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and 13 universities, including Arizona State University, the University of Chicago and Princeton University.\n\n\nThey attest that the NSF violated numerous aspects of the Administrative Procedure Act, including bypassing Congress to unilaterally institute an “arbitrary and capricious” 15 percent rate cap and failing to explain why it’s only imposing the policy on universities.\n\n\nThe NSF awarded $6.7 billion to some 621 universities in 2023.\n\n\nExclusive: NSF faces radical shake-up as officials abolish its 37 divisions | Science | AAAS\n\nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/exclusive-nsf-faces-radical-shake-officials-abolish-its-37-divisions\n\n[The NSF] is plunging into deeper turmoil. According to sources who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, staff were told today that the agency’s 37 divisions—across all eight NSF directorates—are being abolished and the number of programs within those divisions will be drastically reduced. The current directors and deputy directors will lose their titles and might be reassigned to other positions at the agency or elsewhere in the federal government.\n\n\nThe consolidation appears to be driven in part by President Donald Trump’s proposal to cut the agency’s $9 billion budget by 55% for the 2026 fiscal year that begins on 1 October.\n\n\nThe agency is also expected to issue another round of notices tomorrow terminating grants that have already been awarded, sources say. In the past 3 weeks, the agency has pulled the plug on almost 1400 grants worth more than $1 billion.\n\n(CSI faculty were among these who lost funding this week.)\n\n\n\n\nLawsuit Against Humanities Endowment Offers Details on DOGE - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/arts/humanities-endowment-doge-grants.html\n\nEmployees from the Department of Government Efficiency started visiting the office soon after, according to the lawsuit. Citing accounts by former or current staff members at the endowment, the lawsuit says that two DOGE employees, Nate Cavanaugh and Justin Fox, asked for a list of all current grants and then “indiscriminately terminated the vast majority” on April 2. Nearly 1,500 grant recipients received cancellation letters that suggested their projects were not in keeping with “the president’s agenda.”\n\n\nThree weeks later, the agency announced it would be redirecting [stealing ed.] $17 million of its funding to create the National Garden of American Heroes,\n\n\nThe lawsuit contends that those moves violate the Constitution, which reserves the power of the purse for Congress, and also the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\nTrump proposes eliminating the NEA and NEH as arts grants are canceled\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/05/03/trump-budget-nea-neh-eliminate/\n(This applies going forward, the lawsuit applies to past allocations. But the keyword is “proposed”, as this was just part of the Trumpian fantasy budget.)\n\nNYTimes: The National Endowment for the Arts Begins Terminating Grants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/arts/national-endowment-for-the-arts-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nGuidance from MAA (https://www.medievalacademy.org/; thanks EST for sharing)\n\n(This appeared in a news letter, so no link is available)\n\nWith the caveat that the MAA cannot offer actual legal advice, here is the current state of affairs, as we understand it:\n\n\n\nACLS, AHA, and MLA have filed a lawsuit against the NEH and DOGE. The complaint is online here. The suit is likely to proceed quickly, and we will keep you apprised of its progress.\n\n\n\n\nA court decision handed down earlier this week compels the government to restore terminated IMLS funding. I am hopeful that this success will serve as a strong precedent for other suits.\n\n\n\n\nThose who have lost NEH funding should have filed an appeal by now, either as an individual or through their host institution. If you have not done so, the guidance we’ve received is that you should file anyway before taking any further action, following whatever guidelines you have received (and with the understanding that there is, in fact, no truly clear guidance about what is happening at NEH). More information on the appeals process can be found here. When appealing any grant termination, be sure to emphasize how this loss may impact not only your research but your reputation, opportunities passed up to take on the grant-funded project, and the loss of future opportunities that the grant might have made possible. Please remember that our colleagues at NEH – those who remain – are devastated by the current situation and are themselves overwhelmed. They are committed Federal employees who are not to blame for these terminations. I urge you to try to be patient as your appeal (and the lawsuit) move forward.",

Now, investigating discrimination in schools is practically “impossible.”\n\n\nIn South Dakota, the OCR abruptly terminated its work with a school district that had agreed to take steps to end discrimination against its Native American students. The same office that helped craft the agreement to treat indigenous students equally made a stunning about-face and decided in March that helping Native American students would discriminate against white students.\n\n\nOne OCR attorney, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, told ProPublica that their caseload went from 60 to 380 as they absorbed cases previously handled by employees who worked in offices that had been closed.\n\n\n“OCR is the most useless it’s ever been, and it’s the most dangerous it’s ever been. And by useless, I mean unavailable. Unable to do the work,”\n\n\nInvestigating cases that allege racism, discrimination based on sexual orientation or mistreatment of students with disabilities now requires permission from Trump appointees, according to a memo from OCR leadership. As a result, thousands of discrimination investigations are idled, even ones that were nearing a resolution when Trump took office again.\n\n\nInvestigations being publicized now have largely bypassed the agency’s civil rights attorneys, according to Education Department employees.

So too must be the student body, staff and leadership. A failing grade, the letter warned, would result in corrective measures, including the deliberate recruiting of “a critical mass” of new faculty and students to correct the imbalance.\n\n\nHarvard has rejected the Trump administration’s demands, calling them a threat to academic freedom and the political independence of higher education. But in a letter to Harvard affiliates informing them that the university was suing the government, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, echoed that vocabulary.\n\n\n“We acknowledge that we have unfinished business,” Dr. Garber wrote. “We need to ensure that the university lives up to its steps to reaffirm a culture of free inquiry, viewpoint diversity and academic exploration.”\n\n\nHarvard itself has been a hotbed of diverse views about the value of viewpoint diversity and its relationship to the bedrock value of academic freedom. But there’s broad agreement that the Trump administration is weaponizing the term — which its letter never defines — in a dangerous way.\n\n\nThe term viewpoint diversity began gaining currency across academia largely through the efforts of Heterodox Academy, a nonpartisan national group founded in 2015 to combat what it describes as “the rise of closed-minded orthodoxies within scholarly communities.”\n\n\nIn recent years, it has been picked up by Republican politicians, as a new tool to support their longstanding argument that universities have been taken over by the left.\n\n\nA report last October by the free expression group PEN America said that viewpoint diversity, while a laudable goal, has too often served as “camouflage” for the real purpose: stifling faculty members’ speech.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Disqualifies Harvard From Future Research Grants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/trump-harvard-research-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThe letter is as they say meshuga\nhttps://x.com/EDSecMcMahon/status/1919517481313427594\nMy favorite is to now blame it on the math\n\nWhy is it, we ask, that Harvard has to teach simple and basic mathematics, when it is supposedly so hard to get into this “acclaimed university”? Who is getting in under such a low standard when others, with fabulous grades and a great understanding of the highest levels of mathematics, are being rejected?\n\nWhen the NY Times calls this “a contentious letter” they are only sane washing it. It might better be described by an AI prompt “write crazy letter on Harvard in the voice of the president, include all specious claims”\n\nDeciphering the Trump Administration’s Latest Letter to Harvard\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/05/07/experts-unpack-linda-mcmahons-latest-letter-harvard\nInsidehighered found one Project 2025 voice here:\n\n“When the secretary says, ‘Don’t come to us for grants anymore,’ she means that, and she can enforce it,” said Adam Kissel, a visiting fellow in the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Education Policy. “The tone suggests that Harvard really needs to wake up and understand the dire nature of its situation.”\n\nBut by and large, this is the take they find\n\nBut Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, described Monday’s letter as a “particularly disturbing” and “unwarranted escalation of threats.” What the Trump administration has done since day one, Pasquerella said, is launch a “politically motivated attack, not only against Harvard, but higher education as a whole,” and it’s all part of a long-standing Republican playbook.\n\n\nMultiple Inside Higher Ed sources have described the Trump administration’s approach to higher education as “fascist” or “authoritarian,” and Pasquerella even noted that the White House has positioned Viktor Orbán—Hungary’s right-wing prime minister who has long been known for his assault on academic freedom—as someone to emulate.\n\n\n“The president is so bombastic and so over-the-top that it’s hard for me to see gradations,” Hess [director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank] said. “So, sure, the secretary sending a letter that declared ‘don’t bother applying for anything’ is an extraordinary declaration. And in other circumstances, I would have been like, holy cow. But given what the administration has done over the past three and a half months, it’s not clear to me that it changes the administration’s posture.”\n\n\nTrump administration calls for a freeze on all new grants to Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/05/harvard-new-grants-freeze-trump/\n\nMcMahon’s letter displays an astonishing and frankly disqualifying level of ignorance — about Harvard, about how federal research funding works, and about the plain text of the U.S. Constitution,” Weld (AAUP President of Harvard chapter) said. “The entire higher ed sector must reject this crude authoritarianism with one voice.”\n\n\nTed Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, said, “I think we should all be looking at the interchange between the department, Harvard and the White House as harbingers of things to come.” \n\n\nLarry Summers, former president of Harvard, said the Trump administration’s fight with the Ivy League university has larger implications for civil society. “This is about whether the government has the power to coerce private institutions, using all the various authorities it has to advance particular political agendas of the president,” he said. “But for higher education, this is about academic freedom, which for the better part of a century, the Supreme Court recognized as intimately connected to the First Amendment. So in a broad civic sense, it’s about our commitment to constitutional democracy as manifest in the First Amendment.”\n\n\nTrump Finally Drops the Anti-Semitism Pretext – The latest letter to Harvard makes clear that the administration’s goal is to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal. (Thanks BE for the sharing and the gift link!)\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/mcmahon-harvard-letter/682717/?gift=yCYg0MdUGpnvquf3En3lpkKQKFBhGvbst4TkhNQ1SSk&utm_source=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=social\n(A critique that doesn’t sanewash and well worth reading)\n\nThe intensely hostile letter that Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent to the leadership of Harvard yesterday has a lot going on. But the most notable thing about it is what it leaves out.\n\n\nTo hear McMahon tell it, Harvard is a university on the verge of ruin. (I say McMahon because her signature is at the bottom of the letter, but portions of the document are written in such a distinctive idiolect—“Why is there so much HATE?” the letter asks; it signs off with “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”—that one detects the spirit of a certain uncredited co-author.)\n\n\nWhat you will not find in the McMahon letter is any mention of the original justification for the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on elite universities: anti-Semitism.\n\n\nNow, however, the mask is off. Aside from one oblique reference to congressional hearings about anti-Semitism (“the great work of Congresswoman Elise Stefanik”), the letter is silent on the subject. The administration is no longer pretending that it is standing up for Jewish students. The project has been revealed for what it is: an effort to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal.\n\n\n“There’s no ‘We don’t like you’ authority in the federal Constitution or in statutory law. In fact, quite the opposite: You’re precluded from that.” [Derek Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina]\n\n\nHarvard Faculty Pledge 10% of Their Salary to Defend Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/06/harvard-faculty-pledge-10-salary-defend-against-trump\n\nNearly 100 senior faculty members at Harvard have committed to taking a pay cut to support the institution’s legal defense against the federal government.\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Leaders See Only Bad Outcomes Ahead as They Battle Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/harvard-trump-court-case-negotiation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut behind the scenes, several senior officials at Harvard and on its top governing board believe that the university is confronting a crisis that could last until President Trump is out of power, according to three people involved in the discussions. Even if Harvard’s legal case is successful, these officials say, the school will still face enormous troubles that may force the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university to rethink its identity and scale.\n\nSo says\n\nThey spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss school officials’ private deliberations.\n\n\nThe crosscurrents are unlike any that the university has faced in its modern history. For centuries, Harvard has cherished its independence, its swaggering pride and its record of academic excellence. But Mr. Trump has reveled in unleashing chaos that many believe will be difficult to contain as long as he sees the university as a target.\n\n\nThe corporation [the board that oversees the university] has told the school’s lawyers not to engage with the Trump administration, according to the two people involved in discussions.\n\n\nComplicating matters is whether the White House will honor a deal.\n\n\nLawrence H.

Although experts on government contracts and grants scoffed at the missive, the government can essentially blacklist contractors through a process called debarment.\n\n\nAside from the research funding, there will be nothing to stop the administration from saddling the school with more onerous and potentially costly investigations, like the ones currently being conducted by at least five different departments and agencies, including the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Orders to Investigate Columbia Protesters Raised Alarms in Justice Dept.

    "text": "The Scary Implications of U.S. Government Attacks on Medical Journals | Scientific American\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-scary-implications-of-u-s-government-attacks-on-medical-journals/\n\nIn April, I decided to make public a leaked letter from the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to the editor-in-chief of CHEST, a leading pulmonology and critical care journal. I did so because the letter represents an authoritarian threat to science, and I knew it wasn’t an isolated, bizarre incident. It is a warning sign, another move in a broader campaign to exert control over research, medicine and media.\n\n\nThe letter asserts that “publications like CHEST Journal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates.” It was written by recently appointed acting U.S. attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr., who gives no examples that might demonstrate partisanship; nor does he cite any laws or legal principles to indicate a matter that should concern the U.S. government.\n\n\nSince I publicly shared this, at least four additional journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, have confirmed receipt of similar letters, according to MedPage Today, STAT News, the New York Times and Science. Aside from Eric Rubin at the NEJM, none of the targeted editors have been willing to go on record, fearing retribution from the Trump administration.\n\n\nWhy CHEST? It’s a specialty outlet—not even among the top 50 medical journals. Is this a keyword-driven campaign like those we’ve seen at the CDC and NIH? Under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., terms like “diversity,” “minority” and “equity” have been systematically flagged.\n\n\nKennedy frequently makes evidence-free claims on podcasts and television shows and now in government press conferences, regardless of the consequences. However, peer-reviewed journals like CHEST require extensive scrutiny as part of their evaluation process.\n\n\nHow a Decades-Old Diversity Program Became Collateral Damage in Trump’s Anti-DEI Crusade\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-a-decades-old-diversity-program-became-collateral-damage-in-trumps-anti-dei-crusade\n\nThe PhD Project has for three decades encouraged business professionals from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue doctorates in the discipline. For years, its work was seen as uncontroversial; its annual conference introduced midcareer business professionals of color to the academy, offering resources and a support network to those interested in switching jobs. Eventually, some of those prospective students would become professors themselves, helping diversify a traditionally homogenous discipline.",

Woodward, which established safeguards to protect colleges from ideological and political interference.\n\n\nThe chairs of the boards of trustees at Clark Atlanta University, Eastern Michigan University and the University of Illinois are among the signatories, as well as the heads of the Middle States and New England Commissions of Higher Education.\n\n\nLawmakers in several states have introduced legislation that seeks to increase board oversight in processes like academic programming and tenure, as well as a governor’s ability to appoint board members.\n\n\nA Looming Crisis for Public Colleges: If the federal government cuts Medicaid spending, state funding for higher ed will evaporate.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-looming-crisis-for-public-colleges\n\nThe House Republicans’ plan for reconciliation includes a cut of about $880 billion over the next decade in health-care and energy spending and $230 billion from agriculture. A budget reduction of this magnitude will require significant reductions to Medicaid and SNAP.\n\n\nThat would directly harm low- and moderate-income Americans across the country, but these costs will also be passed on to states, putting pressure on already-tight budgets. And, as history has shown us time and time again, a state-budget squeeze almost always leads to skyrocketing college costs and lower-quality public education.\n\n\nMost states are required to pass balanced budgets each year. But some programs, like Medicaid, are directly tied to formulas and federal matching dollars. When revenue is tight, especially in tough economic times, states reduce the portion of their total budgets that remain “discretionary” — the portion that is not dictated by formula-derived expenses.  In almost every state, higher education is the largest discretionary-spending category.\n\n\nFor just one example, look to Pennsylvania, where I [Tanya I. Garcia] previously served as deputy secretary and commissioner for postsecondary and higher education. For the 30-year period from financial year 1991 to financial year 2021, Pennsylvania increased Medicaid spending by 227 percent and decreased higher-education spending by 28 percent.\n\n\nWhen state funding for higher education drops, it affects open-access, less-selective colleges the most, since they are more dependent on state appropriations and less able to raise their prices than their peers at elite public and flagship institutions. This is a crucial distinction, as 86 percent of all undergraduate students pursuing a degree in the United States do not attend selective flagships or research universities.\n\n\nMake no mistake: Such massive federal funding cuts would unleash mayhem on state budgets and public colleges starved for resources. Almost 40 states will have finalized their budgets by June 30 of this year. Will we have a raft of states calling special legislative sessions to revise their budgets when all is said and done in the nation’s capital? We still have time to avoid this.\n\n\nNYTimes: I Know Trump’s Plan for Universities. It Transformed My College.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/opinion/trump-universities-woke.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMr. Trump has been watching what’s transpired in Florida. The architect of Project 2025’s education policies has said that Florida is “leading the way” on university overhauls. Already, Mr. Trump has threatened to pull funding from colleges that don’t purge language he considers woke. He’s demanded new oversight of certain regional studies departments. Next he could try to ban, as Florida has, “political or social activism.” He could weaken the protections provided by tenure and faculty unions. I saw this happen on my campus, and I know the toll it took. If the Trump administration has its way, my experience could offer a preview of what’s coming for other universities.\n\n\nSince Mr. DeSantis’s crackdown, I’ve seen my colleagues harassed and investigated for addressing topical issues, even outside the classroom. The climate of fear gives the government precisely the result it wants. Administrators and faculty members alike practice anticipatory obedience to avoid even the appearance of wokeness, stifling the sort of open and civil discussions that lead students to develop their own views.\n\n\nSeveral professors have been subjected to efforts at entrapment. Last year a man posing as a student tried to encourage Muslim faculty members to criticize Mr. DeSantis and Israel. A similar incident happened to me. … That incident shattered my conviction that if I did my job well and followed the rules, I would be safe.\n\n\nTeaching is, above all, the creation of a community in the classroom, a web of trust and curiosity that binds students and instructors in a shared intellectual project. Mistrust, fear and self-censorship make that project impossible.\n\n\nNYTimes: West Point Is Supposed to Educate, Not Indoctrinate\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/opinion/west-point-trump-military.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Very good summary of how academic freedom is taken away overnight)",

It is well worth getting past the paywall to read/)\n\nThe warlords who sacked Rome did not intend to doom Western Europe to centuries of ignorance. It was not a foreseeable consequence of their actions. The same cannot be said of the sweeping attack on human knowledge and progress that the Trump administration is now undertaking—a deliberate destruction of education, science, and history, conducted with a fanaticism that recalls the Dark Ages that followed Rome’s fall.\n\n\nEvery week brings fresh examples. The administration is threatening colleges and universities with the loss of federal funding if they do not submit to its demands, or even if they do. The engines of American scientific inquiry and ingenuity, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, are under sustained attack. Historical institutions such as the Smithsonian and artistic ones like the Kennedy Center are being converted into homes for MAGA ideology rather than historical fact and free expression. Libraries are losing funding, government-employed scientists are being dismissed from their jobs, educators are being cowed into silence, and researchers are being warned not to broach forbidden subjects. Entire databases of public-health information collected over decades are at risk of vanishing. Any facts that contradict the gospel of Trumpism are treated as heretical.\n\n\nLike the inquisitors of old, who persecuted Galileo for daring to notice that the sun did not, in fact, revolve around the Earth, they believe that truth-seeking imperils their hold on power.\n\n\nBut a massive technological stall is only the most apparent aspect of the coming damage. The attack on knowledge also threatens the country’s ability to address subtler social problems, such as racial and economic inequalities in health, opportunity, and civil rights. Research into these disparities is being cut across government and civil society in the name of defeating so-called wokeness. Invoked as a general criticism of left-wing excess, the fight against “wokeness” is destroying huge swaths of scholarship and research, for fear the results might make the case for racial or gender equality, the redistribution of wealth, or the regulation of industry.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s Politics of Plunder\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/donald-trumps-politics-of-plunder\n\nHistorically, ruling billionaires have tried to avoid such portraits. (A publicist for J. P. Morgan used to say that he was “paid to keep the bank out of the press.”) But the Trump Presidency has embraced an unusually open marriage of politics and profit. Official filings revealed that his Inauguration fund set a new record by collecting some two hundred and fifty million dollars from corporations, C.E.O.s, and other large donors. The biggest donation, five million dollars, came from a major poultry producer called Pilgrim’s Pride. A few months later, Trump’s Agriculture Secretary delighted the industry by agreeing not to increase salmonella testing and promising to cut “unnecessary bureaucracy.” By then, Trump had already fired the director of the Office of Government Ethics and the head of the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates whistle-blower complaints.\n\n\non-one conversations with the President have become available for five million. The return on investment is uncertain, a government-affairs executive told me: “What if he’s in a bad mood? You have no clue where the money is eventually going.” Another lobbying veteran described the frank exchange as “outer-borough Mafia shit.”\n\n\nThe ultra-rich have captured more of America’s wealth than even the nineteenth-century tycoons of the Gilded Age. Scholars who study inequality as far back as the Neolithic period struggle to find precedents. Tim Kerig, an archeologist who directs the Museum Alzey, in Germany, told me, “The people who built the Egyptian pyramids were probably in a less unequal society.” He suggested that today’s richest people are simply accumulating too much wealth for the system to contain. “The economic and technical evolution is much faster than the social, mental, and ideological evolution,” he said. “We had no time to adapt to all those billionaires.”\n\n\nFor fifteen years, the Patriotic Millionaires have waged an earnest battle to persuade wealthy people to lobby for higher taxes on themselves. This has often been a lonesome endeavor, but Trump’s assault on democracy, financed by some of America’s richest people, has fortified the group’s arguments. Scott Ellis, a member who used to run a consulting group at Hewlett-Packard, told me that even skeptical peers in Silicon Valley had become increasingly receptive. “Some friends used to humor me, but they’re listening more,” he said.\n\n\nIn the 2004 election, according to Americans for Tax Fairness, billionaires gave thirteen million dollars in political contributions; twenty years later, the country’s richest families spent more than two hundred times that much. Payne told the crowd, “There’s a point where money is no longer money. It is power—and they’re using that power to screw life up for everybody else.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas House OKs more state oversight of public universities | The Texas Tribune\n\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/24/texas-governing-boards-regents-senate-bill-37/\n\nSenate Bill 37 passed in an 83-53 vote Saturday. It would create a state-level committee that would recommend courses that should be required for graduation and how to condense the number of those courses. Meanwhile, each public university system’s board of regents, who oversee the school’s operations and are appointed by the governor, would be charged with creating a committee to review curricula and reject any course deemed ideologically charged or that doesn’t align with the workforce demands. Specifically, the committees would ensure curricula do not “advocate or promote that any race, sex, ethnicity or religious belief is inherently superior to any other.”\n\n(This bill if passed is much more than a glancing blow to higher education’s principles.)\n\nIn Defense of Academic Freedom - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/05/in-defense-of-academic-freedom/682914/\n\nWhy defend academic freedom even when the ideas in question are wrongheaded or harmful? “It is precisely because any kind of purge opens the gate to all kinds of purge, that freedom of thought necessarily means the freedom to think bad thoughts as well as good.”\n\n\nThose words, written in 1953 by Joseph Alsop, an alumnus of Harvard who later served on its Board of Overseers, are relevant today, as the Trump administration cancels the visas of foreign students for viewpoints that it deems “bad.” And they were relevant in recent years as institutions of higher education investigated and disciplined members of their communities for expressing views that ran afoul of various progressive social-justice orthodoxies. But Alsop wrote them in response to the McCarthy era’s efforts to identify and punish Communists who were working in academia.\n\n\nA Tumultuous Spring Semester Finally Comes to a Close | The New Yorker\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/a-tumultuous-spring-semester-finally-comes-to-a-close\n\nThe biggest mistake that some universities have made is to presume that the White House is operating in good faith. It is not.\n\n\nAcademic freedom in the United States has found itself periodically under siege. In March, Ellen Schrecker, a historian and the author of “No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities,” spoke via Zoom to deans at Columbia (including myself) about government repression on college campuses in the nineteen-fifties. Schrecker, who has taught at both Columbia and Harvard and retired as a professor at Yeshiva University, emphasized the severity of the current climate. “I’ve studied McCarthyism’s impact on higher education for fifty years,” she said. “What’s happening now is worse.” This is in part because universities today are far more beholden to the federal government. The explosive expansion of higher education that began after the Second World War was underwritten by federal dollars. So members of Congress, and President Trump, too, have leverage that demagogues who preceded them could only dream of.\n\n\nMordecai Johnson was a Black man leading an academic institution during Jim Crow when representatives from an almost entirely white Congress asked him whether professors with radical sympathies should be allowed to teach at Howard. Yet he firmly said that he would sooner shut down his university than allow anyone to dictate what its students could or could not learn. The principle at play—that without free inquiry there is no basis for a university to exist—still applies.\n\n\nUtah Lawmakers Flex Their Power Over Public Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/05/28/new-utah-law-prompts-program-cuts-strategic\n(Thanks SC for sharing and caring)\n\nPublic colleges and universities in Utah are set to lose roughly $60 million in July—or 10 percent of their state-funded instructional budgets—but they can earn back that money by cutting programs and positions and investing in other areas considered worthy by state lawmakers, under a law passed this spring.\n\n\nHB 265 is just one example of how Republicans in Utah’s State House are trying to exert more control over public higher education and shape colleges’ academic programs and services. The changes have raised concerns among faculty, who see their traditional academic freedom and shared governance roles in setting curricula and other areas being usurped.\n\n\nSince 2024, lawmakers have mandated post-tenure review; banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and offices; and banned pride flags, Juneteenth flags and others from “prominent” campus locations. They’ve also created a Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that faculty appointed to that center teach all the university’s general education courses while serving on short-term, at-will contracts.\n\n\nAs for university administrators, Gerdes [president of the University of Utah’s AAUP chapter] said, “Our administration wants to have a healthy working relationship with the State Legislature. I think that they are less concerned about having a healthy relationship with their own faculty.”\n\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune reported that university president Taylor R. Randall cited a 2024 law, Senate Bill 192, on the limits of faculty governance to silence an Academic Senate discussion in February that was critical of his provost.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nRFK Jr. says he may bar scientists from publishing in top medical journals\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/rfk-jr-ban-journals-lancet-jama/\n\n“We’re probably going to stop publishing in the Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA and those other journals because they’re all corrupt,” Kennedy said during an appearance on the “Ultimate Human” podcast.

What Are the Consequences?\n\nhttps://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/trump-cancels-federal-research-grants-what-are-consequences\n\nLast August, Jaafar [professor in the math, engineering and computer science department at LaGuardia Community College] realized a long-held dream of hers to win a NSF grant: $530,002 aimed at boosting students’ success in STEM degrees (and consequently their success in New York City’s workplaces). This grant-funded work would have involved about 40 faculty members directly, plus many more through a robust diffusion model, says Jaafar, providing the kind of professional development that leads to “long-term behavioral change, so that faculty become change agents,” she said. “You go through this transformation and then you’re able to transform others.”\n\n\nOver the three years, Jaafar estimates that trained faculty would have influenced about 5,000 students at LaGuardia, a formally designated Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). “Without making these investments, we’re going to enforce the longstanding barriers to access—and we’ll actually be falling short in workforce needs,” she says.\n\n\nThese aren’t the only NSF grants to CUNY institutions that have been terminated. Indeed, about $17 million in grants have been targeted, including the following:\n\n\nA $1 million grant to Queensborough Community College, Queens College and LaGuardia to develop a program that trains students in the emerging field of wastewater-based epidemiology. The goal was to train about 200 students for public-service jobs.\n\n\nA $1 million grant to LaGuardia, City Tech, which is a 4-year college, and the biotechnology company Schrödinger to create a program that provides hands-on, experiential learning and paid internships.\n\n\nA $700,000 grant to the College of Staten Island to increase students’ sense of belonging and retention through peer-led team learning. Already, this project was achieving dramatic increases in passing rates, but because of the grant’s termination its paid peer leaders have been dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Fulbright Applicants, a DEI Disqualifier\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/us-colleges-world/2025/05/29/fulbright-applicants-rejected-over-dei-research-proposals\n\nInside Higher Ed obtained a copy of Rubio’s cable, which says that this year State Department officials would give the final sign-off; they have been tasked with rooting out any projects that could violate President Trump’s executive orders banning diversity, equity and inclusion. All candidates, whether they’d been approved by FFSB [Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board] already or not, would have to pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Seeks Extensive Student Data in Pressure Campaign to Control Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/trump-harvard-international-student-records.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nKristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, sent a letter to Harvard requesting, among other things, coursework for every international student and information on any student visa holder involved in misconduct or illegal activity.\n\n\nMs. Noem also expanded her request for records to include any videos of international students, on campus or off, involved in protests or illegal or dangerous activity.\n\n(This is of note given CUNY’s recent decision to adopt body worn cameras for its public safety officers.)\n\nNYTimes: Why Harvard Has No Way Out\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nHarvard has won praise for fighting back, and many legal experts believe the law is squarely on its side. But the administration holds the levers of power, and is methodically and creatively using them in a take-no-prisoners assault on the school.\n\n\n“I was dumbfounded,” Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, told me. “What’s becoming increasingly clear is that this administration will use any tool that it can.”\n\n\nMS [Michael Schmidt]: There’s been an audacity and creativity to the way that Trump has tried to use his power in the second term, and this is the latest example. Coming into this, we concentrated on his threats to lock up his enemies, like Liz Cheney or James Comey. The use of the government’s power for purely political ends has manifested itself in ways that I think go beyond what we had imagined, and even beyond what Project 2025 contemplated.\n\n\nHarvard officials have privately determined they are in a major, major, major crisis with very few, if any, good off ramps.\n\n(I hope we recognize that Harvard’s battle is the ultimate fight for academic freedom and the independence of higher education – the assault has no rational explanation; its destructiveness can’t be rationalized.)\n\nHarvard Digs In for Battle, but Trump’s Blows Are Landing\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-trump-lawsuits-fight-d5f8ec8a?st=27ignH&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nEven as Harvard looks to the courts for relief, faculty and administrators are making contingency plans and preparing for a drawn-out war with the Trump administration\n\n\nHarvard’s conundrum is that it cannot trust the Trump administration to negotiate in good faith nor can it count on winning an extended battle with the federal government, says Aziz Z. Huq, a law professor at the University of Chicago.\n\n\nThe result, Huq suggests, will be a reset not only for Harvard but across higher education. The current model for research universities was created during World War II, when the military outsourced its research and development to schools. That model served the nation well for decades but is increasingly under attack from MAGA conservatives who believe that higher education has become a hotbed of liberal ideology that needs to be torn down and rebuilt.\n\n(I’d rephrase that last part, but will amplify “That model served the nation well for decades” until the mis-informed got mid-informed.)\n\nThe government seems bent on destroying Harvard for the offense of fighting back.

Noem’s letter to Harvard makes clear that Trump and his sycophants will weaponize the state against anyone who incurs their displeasure. Courts may prevent the worst, but the whole pattern has to end if we want to have any hope of living in a country free of fear and featuring at least minimum respect for the rule of law.\n\n\nAs Harvard’s lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security rightly pointed out, Noem’s revocation fits into the Trump administration’s orgy of vengeance prompted by Harvard’s refusal to comply with evidently illegal demands issued in mid-April.\n\n\nWe can draw larger lessons from this – so far – failed attack (eight investigations, involving six different agencies, are still ongoing). One has to be ready – Harvard’s lawyers clearly were. Universities have to stand with each other; Noem warned all of them that they have to “get their act together” or else. Not least, university leaders have to explain to a larger public how Trumpists, in an unprecedented spree of national self-destruction, are busy preventing cancer cures, damaging American soft power, and killing one of the country’s major exports, namely higher education.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Attacks Have Helped Heal a Deeply Divided Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/us/trump-attacks-unify-divided-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDoes the President Want to Fix Harvard or Destroy It? by @jasonrileywsj\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/opinion/does-the-president-want-to-fix-harvard-or-destroy-it-0bf083d1?st=Ya1Vwx&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(destroy… even the WSJ recognizes this…)\n\nNYTimes: Harvard and Trump Lawyers to Face Off in Court in Foreign Student Case\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/harvard-trump-lawyers-hearing-foreign-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn the courtroom, Harvard’s strategy will use the president’s statements as evidence that the government is on a political crusade against the school.

The Trump administration is all in; is higher ed?)\n\nWhile international students make up slightly more than 5 percent of university students nationwide, some of the nation’s most selective schools rely far more heavily on them. At New York University, home to nearly 60,000 students, one-third of them are international. At Columbia, about two in five students come from abroad. And at Harvard, more than a quarter of students come from across the globe.\n\n\n“This sends a signal to the rest of the world that not only is Harvard closed to the international best and brightest, but that the U.S. is not a welcome place for international students,” Mr. Lakhani said [admissions counselor in New York].\n\n\nTrump’s war on America’s Ivy League universities didn’t start with the 2023 anti-Israel protests.

It is well worth getting past the paywall to read/)\n\nThe warlords who sacked Rome did not intend to doom Western Europe to centuries of ignorance. It was not a foreseeable consequence of their actions. The same cannot be said of the sweeping attack on human knowledge and progress that the Trump administration is now undertaking—a deliberate destruction of education, science, and history, conducted with a fanaticism that recalls the Dark Ages that followed Rome’s fall.\n\n\nEvery week brings fresh examples. The administration is threatening colleges and universities with the loss of federal funding if they do not submit to its demands, or even if they do. The engines of American scientific inquiry and ingenuity, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, are under sustained attack. Historical institutions such as the Smithsonian and artistic ones like the Kennedy Center are being converted into homes for MAGA ideology rather than historical fact and free expression. Libraries are losing funding, government-employed scientists are being dismissed from their jobs, educators are being cowed into silence, and researchers are being warned not to broach forbidden subjects. Entire databases of public-health information collected over decades are at risk of vanishing. Any facts that contradict the gospel of Trumpism are treated as heretical.\n\n\nLike the inquisitors of old, who persecuted Galileo for daring to notice that the sun did not, in fact, revolve around the Earth, they believe that truth-seeking imperils their hold on power.\n\n\nBut a massive technological stall is only the most apparent aspect of the coming damage. The attack on knowledge also threatens the country’s ability to address subtler social problems, such as racial and economic inequalities in health, opportunity, and civil rights. Research into these disparities is being cut across government and civil society in the name of defeating so-called wokeness. Invoked as a general criticism of left-wing excess, the fight against “wokeness” is destroying huge swaths of scholarship and research, for fear the results might make the case for racial or gender equality, the redistribution of wealth, or the regulation of industry.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s Politics of Plunder\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/donald-trumps-politics-of-plunder\n\nHistorically, ruling billionaires have tried to avoid such portraits. (A publicist for J. P. Morgan used to say that he was “paid to keep the bank out of the press.”) But the Trump Presidency has embraced an unusually open marriage of politics and profit. Official filings revealed that his Inauguration fund set a new record by collecting some two hundred and fifty million dollars from corporations, C.E.O.s, and other large donors. The biggest donation, five million dollars, came from a major poultry producer called Pilgrim’s Pride. A few months later, Trump’s Agriculture Secretary delighted the industry by agreeing not to increase salmonella testing and promising to cut “unnecessary bureaucracy.” By then, Trump had already fired the director of the Office of Government Ethics and the head of the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates whistle-blower complaints.\n\n\non-one conversations with the President have become available for five million. The return on investment is uncertain, a government-affairs executive told me: “What if he’s in a bad mood? You have no clue where the money is eventually going.” Another lobbying veteran described the frank exchange as “outer-borough Mafia shit.”\n\n\nThe ultra-rich have captured more of America’s wealth than even the nineteenth-century tycoons of the Gilded Age. Scholars who study inequality as far back as the Neolithic period struggle to find precedents. Tim Kerig, an archeologist who directs the Museum Alzey, in Germany, told me, “The people who built the Egyptian pyramids were probably in a less unequal society.” He suggested that today’s richest people are simply accumulating too much wealth for the system to contain. “The economic and technical evolution is much faster than the social, mental, and ideological evolution,” he said. “We had no time to adapt to all those billionaires.”\n\n\nFor fifteen years, the Patriotic Millionaires have waged an earnest battle to persuade wealthy people to lobby for higher taxes on themselves. This has often been a lonesome endeavor, but Trump’s assault on democracy, financed by some of America’s richest people, has fortified the group’s arguments. Scott Ellis, a member who used to run a consulting group at Hewlett-Packard, told me that even skeptical peers in Silicon Valley had become increasingly receptive. “Some friends used to humor me, but they’re listening more,” he said.\n\n\nIn the 2004 election, according to Americans for Tax Fairness, billionaires gave thirteen million dollars in political contributions; twenty years later, the country’s richest families spent more than two hundred times that much. Payne told the crowd, “There’s a point where money is no longer money. It is power—and they’re using that power to screw life up for everybody else.”",

    "text": "Texas House OKs more state oversight of public universities | The Texas Tribune\n\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/24/texas-governing-boards-regents-senate-bill-37/\n\nSenate Bill 37 passed in an 83-53 vote Saturday. It would create a state-level committee that would recommend courses that should be required for graduation and how to condense the number of those courses. Meanwhile, each public university system’s board of regents, who oversee the school’s operations and are appointed by the governor, would be charged with creating a committee to review curricula and reject any course deemed ideologically charged or that doesn’t align with the workforce demands. Specifically, the committees would ensure curricula do not “advocate or promote that any race, sex, ethnicity or religious belief is inherently superior to any other.”\n\n(This bill if passed is much more than a glancing blow to higher education’s principles.)\n\nIn Defense of Academic Freedom - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/05/in-defense-of-academic-freedom/682914/\n\nWhy defend academic freedom even when the ideas in question are wrongheaded or harmful? “It is precisely because any kind of purge opens the gate to all kinds of purge, that freedom of thought necessarily means the freedom to think bad thoughts as well as good.”\n\n\nThose words, written in 1953 by Joseph Alsop, an alumnus of Harvard who later served on its Board of Overseers, are relevant today, as the Trump administration cancels the visas of foreign students for viewpoints that it deems “bad.” And they were relevant in recent years as institutions of higher education investigated and disciplined members of their communities for expressing views that ran afoul of various progressive social-justice orthodoxies. But Alsop wrote them in response to the McCarthy era’s efforts to identify and punish Communists who were working in academia.\n\n\nA Tumultuous Spring Semester Finally Comes to a Close | The New Yorker\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/a-tumultuous-spring-semester-finally-comes-to-a-close\n\nThe biggest mistake that some universities have made is to presume that the White House is operating in good faith. It is not.\n\n\nAcademic freedom in the United States has found itself periodically under siege. In March, Ellen Schrecker, a historian and the author of “No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities,” spoke via Zoom to deans at Columbia (including myself) about government repression on college campuses in the nineteen-fifties. Schrecker, who has taught at both Columbia and Harvard and retired as a professor at Yeshiva University, emphasized the severity of the current climate. “I’ve studied McCarthyism’s impact on higher education for fifty years,” she said. “What’s happening now is worse.” This is in part because universities today are far more beholden to the federal government. The explosive expansion of higher education that began after the Second World War was underwritten by federal dollars. So members of Congress, and President Trump, too, have leverage that demagogues who preceded them could only dream of.\n\n\nMordecai Johnson was a Black man leading an academic institution during Jim Crow when representatives from an almost entirely white Congress asked him whether professors with radical sympathies should be allowed to teach at Howard. Yet he firmly said that he would sooner shut down his university than allow anyone to dictate what its students could or could not learn. The principle at play—that without free inquiry there is no basis for a university to exist—still applies.\n\n\nUtah Lawmakers Flex Their Power Over Public Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/05/28/new-utah-law-prompts-program-cuts-strategic\n(Thanks SC for sharing and caring)\n\nPublic colleges and universities in Utah are set to lose roughly $60 million in July—or 10 percent of their state-funded instructional budgets—but they can earn back that money by cutting programs and positions and investing in other areas considered worthy by state lawmakers, under a law passed this spring.\n\n\nHB 265 is just one example of how Republicans in Utah’s State House are trying to exert more control over public higher education and shape colleges’ academic programs and services. The changes have raised concerns among faculty, who see their traditional academic freedom and shared governance roles in setting curricula and other areas being usurped.\n\n\nSince 2024, lawmakers have mandated post-tenure review; banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and offices; and banned pride flags, Juneteenth flags and others from “prominent” campus locations. They’ve also created a Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that faculty appointed to that center teach all the university’s general education courses while serving on short-term, at-will contracts.\n\n\nAs for university administrators, Gerdes [president of the University of Utah’s AAUP chapter] said, “Our administration wants to have a healthy working relationship with the State Legislature. I think that they are less concerned about having a healthy relationship with their own faculty.”\n\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune reported that university president Taylor R. Randall cited a 2024 law, Senate Bill 192, on the limits of faculty governance to silence an Academic Senate discussion in February that was critical of his provost.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nRFK Jr. says he may bar scientists from publishing in top medical journals\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/rfk-jr-ban-journals-lancet-jama/\n\n“We’re probably going to stop publishing in the Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA and those other journals because they’re all corrupt,” Kennedy said during an appearance on the “Ultimate Human” podcast. He also described the journals as being under the control of pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\nOn his plans for the department to create its own journals, Kennedy said they would “become the preeminent journals, because if you get [NIH] funding, it is anointing you as a good, legitimate scientist.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump addresses a West Point upended by his changes\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/24/trump-west-point-graduation-dei-military/\n\nHe said that as president, he had rebuilt the military “better than ever before” and rid it of “social experiments” like the teaching of critical race theory and efforts to support transgender soldiers. And he took credit for a rise in military recruitment.\n\n\n“It’s a feeling of real whiplash,” said Graham Parsons, a former West Point professor who resigned from America’s oldest service academy after publicly criticizing the impact of Trump’s policies. “We used to raise the possibility that in the military and beyond, there are still real structural problems with racism and sexism. That would not fly now.”\n\n\nNYTimes: For Trump, Civil Rights Protections Should Help White Men\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/us/politics/trump-race-civil-right-white-men.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAnd last month, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission launched an investigation at Harvard University, alleging that the school had engaged in discriminatory hiring because it showed a significant increase in the percentage of minority, female and nonbinary faculty earning tenure over the past decade while the rates for white men declined.\n\n\nConservatives have denounced disparate impact because it relies on outcome data to allege and prove discrimination — the basis on which Ms. Lucas lodged her charge against Harvard.\n\n\nHow Harmeet Dhillon is engineering a U-turn in the Justice Department’s civil-rights division\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/harmeet-dhillons-civil-rights-revolution-comes-with-tea-and-roses-ff9b1874?st=s7pVVz&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(An attempt at a flattering profile, but don’t be put led astray)\n\n“What we’re seeing now is a complete gutting of all the traditional work of the civil-rights division and then a rump of the civil-rights division being used almost exclusively to pursue right-wing Trumpist agenda items,” said Samuel Bagenstos, a former senior civil-rights official in the Obama Justice Department.\n\n\nUncle Sam’s new message to young Black Americans: I don’t want you\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/27/trump-military-hostile-black-americans/\n\nTrump and his allies have pushed aggressively to defund or eliminate DEI programs across the military. One of Trump’s first actions was to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., only the second African American ever to hold that position. Training on racial bias, cultural competency and inclusive leadership has been gutted and labeled “radical.” Officers who speak up about race or systemic injustice are accused of pushing “politics,” while those promoting exclusionary rhetoric are celebrated as patriots.\n\n\nThe message is clear: If you’re Black, Brown or anything other than the old guard — a White male — your presence in the military is conditional and increasingly unwelcome.\n\n\nThe Era of DEI for Conservatives Has Begun\n\n(Thanks BE)\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/conservative-professors-dei-initiatives/682944/?gift=yCYg0MdUGpnvquf3En3lpjtTtgMgla5OiobYjP9Hxt4&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share\n\nLegislatures in red and purple states across the country have shoveled money into universities to establish schools of civic thought, which are marketed as the conservative answer to academia’s leftward drift and the rise of identity-oriented disciplines.\n\n\nRepublicans have unfairly smeared affirmative action as a way to hire people “based on their race and not on their qualifications.” Now they’re the ones who want to hire professors based on their politics, not their fitness for the role.",

This grant-funded work would have involved about 40 faculty members directly, plus many more through a robust diffusion model, says Jaafar, providing the kind of professional development that leads to “long-term behavioral change, so that faculty become change agents,” she said. “You go through this transformation and then you’re able to transform others.”\n\n\nOver the three years, Jaafar estimates that trained faculty would have influenced about 5,000 students at LaGuardia, a formally designated Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). “Without making these investments, we’re going to enforce the longstanding barriers to access—and we’ll actually be falling short in workforce needs,” she says.\n\n\nThese aren’t the only NSF grants to CUNY institutions that have been terminated. Indeed, about $17 million in grants have been targeted, including the following:\n\n\nA $1 million grant to Queensborough Community College, Queens College and LaGuardia to develop a program that trains students in the emerging field of wastewater-based epidemiology. The goal was to train about 200 students for public-service jobs.\n\n\nA $1 million grant to LaGuardia, City Tech, which is a 4-year college, and the biotechnology company Schrödinger to create a program that provides hands-on, experiential learning and paid internships.\n\n\nA $700,000 grant to the College of Staten Island to increase students’ sense of belonging and retention through peer-led team learning.

The current model for research universities was created during World War II, when the military outsourced its research and development to schools. That model served the nation well for decades but is increasingly under attack from MAGA conservatives who believe that higher education has become a hotbed of liberal ideology that needs to be torn down and rebuilt.\n\n(I’d rephrase that last part, but will amplify “That model served the nation well for decades” until the mis-informed got mid-informed.)\n\nThe government seems bent on destroying Harvard for the offense of fighting back.

Noem’s letter to Harvard makes clear that Trump and his sycophants will weaponize the state against anyone who incurs their displeasure. Courts may prevent the worst, but the whole pattern has to end if we want to have any hope of living in a country free of fear and featuring at least minimum respect for the rule of law.\n\n\nAs Harvard’s lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security rightly pointed out, Noem’s revocation fits into the Trump administration’s orgy of vengeance prompted by Harvard’s refusal to comply with evidently illegal demands issued in mid-April.\n\n\nWe can draw larger lessons from this – so far – failed attack (eight investigations, involving six different agencies, are still ongoing). One has to be ready – Harvard’s lawyers clearly were. Universities have to stand with each other; Noem warned all of them that they have to “get their act together” or else. Not least, university leaders have to explain to a larger public how Trumpists, in an unprecedented spree of national self-destruction, are busy preventing cancer cures, damaging American soft power, and killing one of the country’s major exports, namely higher education.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Attacks Have Helped Heal a Deeply Divided Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/us/trump-attacks-unify-divided-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDoes the President Want to Fix Harvard or Destroy It? by @jasonrileywsj\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/opinion/does-the-president-want-to-fix-harvard-or-destroy-it-0bf083d1?st=Ya1Vwx&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(destroy… even the WSJ recognizes this…)\n\nNYTimes: Harvard and Trump Lawyers to Face Off in Court in Foreign Student Case\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/harvard-trump-lawyers-hearing-foreign-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn the courtroom, Harvard’s strategy will use the president’s statements as evidence that the government is on a political crusade against the school. In briefs filed in the case, lawyers have argued Trump administration officials have unjustly singled out the university for punishment, violating its First Amendment rights. It has included the president’s aggressive comments as exhibits in its case.\n\n\nA visa ban would affect 7,000 students at Harvard.

The Trump administration is all in; is higher ed?)\n\nWhile international students make up slightly more than 5 percent of university students nationwide, some of the nation’s most selective schools rely far more heavily on them. At New York University, home to nearly 60,000 students, one-third of them are international. At Columbia, about two in five students come from abroad. And at Harvard, more than a quarter of students come from across the globe.\n\n\n“This sends a signal to the rest of the world that not only is Harvard closed to the international best and brightest, but that the U.S. is not a welcome place for international students,” Mr. Lakhani said [admissions counselor in New York].\n\n\nTrump’s war on America’s Ivy League universities didn’t start with the 2023 anti-Israel protests. It was set off in 2019 by a sucker punch that left a man with a black eye.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-college-university-federal-funding-fight-91c2a274?st=4xm3Hq&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(I’m sure this rationale was used by the Project 2025 authors…)",

It awards grants that fund research fellowships, programs at museums and historic sites, website development and documentary filmmaking, among a host of other projects related to the public humanities. But it also disburses a great chunk of its appropriation — some $65 million of an annual budget of roughly $210 million — directly to nonprofit humanities councils in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and five territories.\n\n\nStaff cuts begin at NEH, threatening humanities programs across U.S.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2025/04/10/neh-staff-cuts-reduction-in-force/\n\nTrump Presents Harvard With an Ultimatum for Federal Funds\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/04/trump-sets-demands-harvard-must-meet-regain-federal\n\nThe ultimatum came just three days after the president’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism notified the university it had been placed under review for its alleged failure to protect Jewish students and faculty from discrimination. If the case follows the precedent set at other universities, Harvard and its affiliate medical institutions could lose up to $9 billion in federal grants and contracts if they do not comply.\n\n\nSources say the move is driven less by true concern about antisemitism on campus than by the government’s desire to abolish diversity efforts and hobble higher ed institutions it deems too “woke.” This week alone, the administration has retracted funds from Brown and Princeton Universities. Before that, it targeted the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University and opened dozens of civil rights investigations at other colleges, all of which are ongoing.\n\n(Also https://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-demands-harvard-eradicate-dei-to-preserve-its-federal-funding)\n\nNYTimes: Columbia’s Former Leader Faced Contentious Interview After Resigning\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/nyregion/columbia-president-armstrong-federal-deposition.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe hearing transcript provided an inside glimpse of the tension between Columbia and representatives of the Trump administration’s multiagency antisemitism task force, which is investigating at least 10 universities in an effort to root out what it sees as disturbing antisemitic activity on campuses.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Freezes $1 Billion for Cornell and $790 Million for Northwestern, Officials Say\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/cornell-northwestern-university-funds-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe moves are the latest and largest in a rapidly escalating campaign against elite American universities that has resulted in billions in federal funds being suspended or put under review in just over a month. Other schools that have had funds threatened include Brown, Columbia, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton.\n\n\nNorthwestern, a Big Ten university, is the first non-Ivy League school to have funding from the Trump administration targeted under investigations of alleged discrimination.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon said last month that she believed Columbia was “on the right track” toward final negotiations to unfreeze the research funds.\n\n\nInstead, the Trump administration has gone in the opposite direction, cutting off even more research funding. According to Science, the NIH froze Columbia’s funding Monday at the direction of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH is reportedly not only blocking new funding but also ceasing payments for work on existing projects. In addition, the agency will require prior approval to tap existing disbursements.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: When Trump Is Done, What Will Remain of Public Education?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/opinion/trump-k-12-education.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nA longer piece on the history of the DOE and education in US history\n\nAmerica’s story is one of progress, which has rarely been obtained simply through good will. It has to be enforced. Fights for equality have been messy, and quite bloody at times. Understanding that history is important so as not to repeat it. Still, shortly before leaving office in 2020, Mr. Trump established the President’s Advisory 1776 Commission, in part a rebuttal to the 1619 Project, as a way for the administration to write its own version of American history.\n\n\nThe president’s vision to take a sledgehammer to the Department of Education’s ability to function will cause student suffering. The founders believed that education was critical to the full experience of citizenship; it was where students learned arts, sciences, humanities and how to engage with one another. But putting that vision into place left the nation with a system where inequities — in content and classroom composition — were left in place.\n\n\nAmerica began to undo those inequities, and the department protected that progress. Now, less than three months into Mr. Trump’s second presidency, the administration has done everything in its power, and some things beyond its authority, to ensure we are equal no more.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump cancels dozens of international student visas at UC, Stanford - Los Angeles Times\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-05/trump-administration-cancels-international-student-visas-university-of-california-stanford\n\nAt UC San Diego, Chancellor Pradeep Khosla said in a campus message late Friday that five students had their visas revoked.

The officers carried at least one student off the lawn, according to video posted on social media and student interviews.\n\n\nHow conservatives are using Columbia as a ‘test case’ to enforce Trump’s agenda\n\nhttps://wapo.st/43EUxWX\nThis is an important analysis of the playbook being employed and it references what appears to be another Chris Rufo type.\n\nCritical of college admissions, diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and campus protests that he lambasted as pro-Hamas, Max Eden, then a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote an outline that presaged what was to come in the new Trump administration. He singled out Columbia as the top target.\n\n\n “To scare universities straight,” Eden wrote in the Washington Examiner [https://www.aei.org/op-eds/a-comprehensive-guide-to-overhauling-higher-education/] , Education Secretary Linda McMahon “should start by taking a prize scalp. She should simply destroy Columbia University.”\n\n\nOn the day the administration canceled the federal funding to the school, a senior Trump administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, described Columbia as a “test case” for using funding to pressure colleges to comply with Trump’s ideology.\n\n\n“We’re going to bankrupt these universities,” Leo Terrell, leader of the recently formed Justice Department task force on antisemitism, said on Fox News after the cuts to Columbia were announced.\n\n\n“They are targeting private institutions of education and attempting to police and control speech, political expression and thought. And that is truly unprecedented,” said Orion Danjuma, counsel at Protect Democracy, which is representing the unions alongside the law firm Altshuler Berzon. “Columbia is the testing ground for this. It’s a canary in the coal mine.”\n\n\nOther changes are not an exact match to the administration’s demands. The university is not abolishing its judicial board that oversees disciplinary cases as requested. But it will remove students from participating and give the provost oversight. It is not putting the Middle East, South Asian and African Studies department in academic receivership for five years as the administration wanted. That academic department will undergo a review by the provost’s office.\n\n\n“This was planned,” said Reinhold Martin, president of Columbia’s chapter of the AAUP. “We’ve seen the script. The assault on Columbia is going according to that script.”\n\nAs for the Eden piece here are his talking points:\n\nCutting Off Federal Funding – Columbia was, perhaps, the worst offender in indulging the pro-Hamas campus radicals. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights should initiate a compliance review of every single decision Columbia made. To do that, OCR would need the identities of every single foreign student who supported the protests, actions the Trump administration could deem material support of a terrorist organization. Border czar Tom Homan could then revoke every single one of the foreign protesting students’ visas. If Columbia doesn’t cooperate, McMahon could cut off its research grant funding.\n\n\nRemoving Foreign Money from Higher Education – And while the Trump administration is looking into Columbia, the Justice Department should thoroughly explore indicting former Columbia President Lee Bollinger for fraud if he, through commission or omission, played a role in Columbia’s submission of inaccurate data to US News and World Report. Bollinger submitted the data to boost Columbia’s rank in the report. Once the true data were reported, Columbia’s rank fell from second to 18th. College presidents regard Bollinger as perhaps the greatest college leader of the 21st century. He should be regarded as the worst. Perhaps the college presidents could learn a valuable lesson from the sight of him in an orange jumpsuit.\n\n\nThe second target should be the University of California, Los Angeles. UCLA’s …\n\n\nEnforcing Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard; he first step should be forcing Harvard University to comply. Right after the decision was issued, Harvard all but publicly vowed to do everything in its power to violate the spirit of the Supreme Court’s ruling and the 14th Amendment on which it was based. McMahon should initiate a never-ending compliance review to ensure that Harvard follows the law. … If OCR finds a shred of evidence of racial discrimination, Harvard should lose its Title IV funds. I\n\n\nAnd so many other universities have essentially forfeited the privilege of picking their own professors.\n\n\nThe University of Washington and UIC should be forced to pay back wages to every single white applicant they declined to hire over a DEI statement and hire as many as would still like to work there. … However, it could demand all documents and correspondence on hiring in every university faculty department that implemented DEI statements. It could then train an artificial intelligence model to sort through the records and flag likely discrimination. Trump staffers could then send internal, FOIA-able correspondence regarding hot spots of likely discrimination. … Enterprising trial attorneys could team up with starving adjunct professors, and universities could be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement fees. That would teach them a painful lesson: Hiring based on race rather than academic merit comes at a very high cost.\n\n\nHow Trump can Destroy DEI on Campus – it’s all stereotyping. DEI violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment when stereotyping is institutionalized and promoted in an educational institution receiving federal funding — or so the Trump administration should hold and enforce. … To assure compliance with the 14th Amendment, McMahon could task accreditors with ensuring that students aren’t forced to take DEI-infused courses to graduate. This would, essentially, take Florida’s policy of removing DEI from general education requirements national. When students aren’t forced to take these courses, far fewer will, and the radical Marxists will lose students and influence. … McMahon could also champion college students’ First Amendment rights by forcing colleges to dismantle their so-called “Bias Reporting Systems.” More than half of colleges encourage students to snitch on each other for saying something “biased,” and students suspected of wrong speak are then hauled in front of a campus tribunal of DEI administrators.\n\n\nShaking Up College Accreditation – Trump suggested he would simply fire all the existing accreditors. That could prove prohibitively difficult. But Trump could easily decimate the worst of them: the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. … Trump could also easily expedite the approval of additional accreditors. These accreditors could provide a much more streamlined, cost-effective, outcomes-oriented paradigm than the existing set. They could also specialize in helping to launch new colleges, such as the University of Austin, and even newer ones that no one has dreamed up yet. Musk University? Thiel Technical College?\n\n\nA New Kind of Public College What about the American Academy? Experts laughed when Trump proposed launching a new, federally backed college. But former President George Washington wanted one. … At absolute minimum, the American Academy could offer a two-year, high-quality core curriculum, and sympathetic states could mandate their flagship universities accept transfer credit. The Universities of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the like could hoover up students who might otherwise have spent far bigger bucks on a private university with a similar prestige level.\n\n\nThese are just some ideas, and they’re just mine. And, of course, there’s far more the next Trump Education Department should and can do — it just wouldn’t be prudent to broadcast those ideas ahead of time, lest universities take defensive measures.\n\n\nTrump Administration Wants to Install Federal Oversight of Columbia University - The Wall Street Journal. (Thanks KB)\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-consent-decree-trump-federal-funding-2f4c4690?st=nRCE68\n\nA consent decree would be a major escalation of how the federal government normally resolves education-related civil-rights issues. Typically after federal lawyers investigate and find evidence that civil rights were violated, schools enter voluntary agreements to change their practices. The federal government has little ability to enforce such agreements. The Biden administration entered into such voluntary agreements over antisemitism concerns with Brown University and Rutgers.\n\n\nColumbia could fight the move in court; the Justice Department would need to prove that the arrangement is warranted. But a court case could take years, and Columbia would likely lose federal funding in the interim—and might ultimately lose. Opposing the move would also open the school up to required depositions and legal fact-finding, which could keep the school’s campus politics in the spotlight.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: A Playbook for Standing Up to President Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/opinion/trump-law-firms-universities.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThese institutions do not have to capitulate to Mr. Trump. They have a realistic path to defeating his intimidation.\n\n\nYes, Mr. Trump has adopted a more extreme approach to executive power in his second term. He has won some early policy victories, and he will win more. Nonetheless, he faces real constraints on his power. Indeed, the most likely path to American autocracy depends on not only a power-hungry president but also the voluntary capitulation of a cowed civil society. It depends on the mistaken belief that a president is invincible. Anybody who has dealt with a schoolyard bully should recognize this principle: The illusion of invincibility is often his greatest asset.\n\n\nNYTimes: Obama Calls for Universities to Stand Up for Core Values\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/obama-trump-college-speech.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, in a campus speech on Thursday, urged universities to resist attacks from the federal government that violate their academic freedom.\n\n\nHe also said schools and students should engage in self-reflection about speech environments on their campuses.\n\n\nEisgruber signals that Princeton will not make concessions (Thanks KB)\n\nhttps://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/04/princeton-news-adpol-eisgruber-university-concessions-bloomberg-interview\n\n“We would look at ways to potentially reallocate endowment funding, which would involve very difficult choices, but at the end of the day, what would happen here and elsewhere is that less research would get done, and that would be a bad thing,” he said.\n\n\nEisgruber also emphasized the need for universities to act together in response to governmental funding cuts.\n\n\n“I think it’s important for universities to stand shoulder to shoulder as we go forward,” he said.\n\nSee also this podcast\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-university-president-willing-to-fight-trump/id1200361736?i=1000702847509\n(which was shared by MOO to the mailing list)\n\nNYTimes: New York Warns Trump It Will Not Comply With Public School D.E.I.

He has mobilized dozens of professors from across the country to track on his website criticalrace.org hundreds of social-justice statements, staff diversity trainings, and courses he says indoctrinate students with false ideas about American racism. His site has been cited more than 170 times by mainstream-media outlets.\n\n\nThe Legal Insurrection Foundation, Jacobson’s nonprofit, collected $1.2 million in revenue from donations and grants in 2023, according to tax filings. It’s not clear who has donated to his cause.\n\n\nThis past December, Jacobson filed a complaint to OCR against the University of Rhode Island for offering more than 31 scholarships exclusively given to minority students. Mentioned in the complaint was the Miya Brophy-Baermann scholarship, which provides $1,500 to speech-language-pathology students who are racial minorities, men, or the first in their families to attend college.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: America’s Brightest Minds Will Walk Away\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/opinion/young-american-scientists.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMany young researchers say they are having to choose between staying in the United States and staying in science.

But on this one point, Donald Trump wants no ambiguity: “My promise to Jewish Americans is this,” he said on the campaign trail. “With your vote, I will be your defender, your protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.”\n\n\nAs the first Jewish president of a formerly Methodist university, I find no comfort in the Trump administration’s embrace of my people, on college campuses or elsewhere. Jew hatred is real, but today’s anti-antisemitism isn’t a legitimate effort to fight it. It’s a cover for a wide range of agendas that have nothing to do with the welfare of Jewish people.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Vandalism of Muslim Prayer Room at N.Y.U.

It’s almost impossible to start a new university today largely because of our accreditation system. And universities that underperform are allowed to go on underperforming with few consequences,” he said.\n\n\n(Speculation is rife that an executive order reshaping accreditation will be issued this month.)\n\n\nFirst, he argued for the need to reorient the enforcement of civil rights on campus, which he said the department has begun to do by holding universities accountable for harassment, discrimination and specifically antisemitism.\n\n\nPidluzny also said that ED must “reorient federal investments away from ideology, back to the advancement of learning and teaching excellence”\n\n\nAnd he argued for a “new vision” of funding universities and holding them accountable.\n\n\nLinks: Some of these links are available to CUNY faculty, not all.

After initially barring the Trump administration from implementing the change in February, she extended her order twice while the lawsuit played out.\n\n\nNYTimes: The N.E.H.

It awards grants that fund research fellowships, programs at museums and historic sites, website development and documentary filmmaking, among a host of other projects related to the public humanities. But it also disburses a great chunk of its appropriation — some $65 million of an annual budget of roughly $210 million — directly to nonprofit humanities councils in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and five territories.\n\n\nStaff cuts begin at NEH, threatening humanities programs across U.S.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2025/04/10/neh-staff-cuts-reduction-in-force/\n\nTrump Presents Harvard With an Ultimatum for Federal Funds\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/04/trump-sets-demands-harvard-must-meet-regain-federal\n\nThe ultimatum came just three days after the president’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism notified the university it had been placed under review for its alleged failure to protect Jewish students and faculty from discrimination. If the case follows the precedent set at other universities, Harvard and its affiliate medical institutions could lose up to $9 billion in federal grants and contracts if they do not comply.\n\n\nSources say the move is driven less by true concern about antisemitism on campus than by the government’s desire to abolish diversity efforts and hobble higher ed institutions it deems too “woke.” This week alone, the administration has retracted funds from Brown and Princeton Universities. Before that, it targeted the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University and opened dozens of civil rights investigations at other colleges, all of which are ongoing.\n\n(Also https://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-demands-harvard-eradicate-dei-to-preserve-its-federal-funding)\n\nNYTimes: Columbia’s Former Leader Faced Contentious Interview After Resigning\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/nyregion/columbia-president-armstrong-federal-deposition.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe hearing transcript provided an inside glimpse of the tension between Columbia and representatives of the Trump administration’s multiagency antisemitism task force, which is investigating at least 10 universities in an effort to root out what it sees as disturbing antisemitic activity on campuses.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Freezes $1 Billion for Cornell and $790 Million for Northwestern, Officials Say\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/cornell-northwestern-university-funds-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe moves are the latest and largest in a rapidly escalating campaign against elite American universities that has resulted in billions in federal funds being suspended or put under review in just over a month. Other schools that have had funds threatened include Brown, Columbia, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton.\n\n\nNorthwestern, a Big Ten university, is the first non-Ivy League school to have funding from the Trump administration targeted under investigations of alleged discrimination. The university issued a “progress report” last week that highlighted its efforts to protect Jewish students, including mandatory antisemitism training for all students, faculty and staff.\n\nAlso reported on here\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-team-to-freeze-nearly-2-billion-at-cornell-and-northwestern-universities-2e13a88a?st=BJbjFN&reflink=article_gmail_share\nand elsewhere\n\nNYTimes: Trump Has Targeted These Universities.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon said last month that she believed Columbia was “on the right track” toward final negotiations to unfreeze the research funds.\n\n\nInstead, the Trump administration has gone in the opposite direction, cutting off even more research funding. According to Science, the NIH froze Columbia’s funding Monday at the direction of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH is reportedly not only blocking new funding but also ceasing payments for work on existing projects. In addition, the agency will require prior approval to tap existing disbursements.",

The officers carried at least one student off the lawn, according to video posted on social media and student interviews.\n\n\nHow conservatives are using Columbia as a ‘test case’ to enforce Trump’s agenda\n\nhttps://wapo.st/43EUxWX\nThis is an important analysis of the playbook being employed and it references what appears to be another Chris Rufo type.\n\nCritical of college admissions, diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and campus protests that he lambasted as pro-Hamas, Max Eden, then a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote an outline that presaged what was to come in the new Trump administration. He singled out Columbia as the top target.\n\n\n “To scare universities straight,” Eden wrote in the Washington Examiner [https://www.aei.org/op-eds/a-comprehensive-guide-to-overhauling-higher-education/] , Education Secretary Linda McMahon “should start by taking a prize scalp. She should simply destroy Columbia University.”\n\n\nOn the day the administration canceled the federal funding to the school, a senior Trump administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, described Columbia as a “test case” for using funding to pressure colleges to comply with Trump’s ideology.\n\n\n“We’re going to bankrupt these universities,” Leo Terrell, leader of the recently formed Justice Department task force on antisemitism, said on Fox News after the cuts to Columbia were announced.\n\n\n“They are targeting private institutions of education and attempting to police and control speech, political expression and thought. And that is truly unprecedented,” said Orion Danjuma, counsel at Protect Democracy, which is representing the unions alongside the law firm Altshuler Berzon. “Columbia is the testing ground for this. It’s a canary in the coal mine.”\n\n\nOther changes are not an exact match to the administration’s demands. The university is not abolishing its judicial board that oversees disciplinary cases as requested. But it will remove students from participating and give the provost oversight. It is not putting the Middle East, South Asian and African Studies department in academic receivership for five years as the administration wanted. That academic department will undergo a review by the provost’s office.\n\n\n“This was planned,” said Reinhold Martin, president of Columbia’s chapter of the AAUP. “We’ve seen the script. The assault on Columbia is going according to that script.”\n\nAs for the Eden piece here are his talking points:\n\nCutting Off Federal Funding – Columbia was, perhaps, the worst offender in indulging the pro-Hamas campus radicals. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights should initiate a compliance review of every single decision Columbia made. To do that, OCR would need the identities of every single foreign student who supported the protests, actions the Trump administration could deem material support of a terrorist organization. Border czar Tom Homan could then revoke every single one of the foreign protesting students’ visas. If Columbia doesn’t cooperate, McMahon could cut off its research grant funding.\n\n\nRemoving Foreign Money from Higher Education – And while the Trump administration is looking into Columbia, the Justice Department should thoroughly explore indicting former Columbia President Lee Bollinger for fraud if he, through commission or omission, played a role in Columbia’s submission of inaccurate data to US News and World Report. Bollinger submitted the data to boost Columbia’s rank in the report. Once the true data were reported, Columbia’s rank fell from second to 18th. College presidents regard Bollinger as perhaps the greatest college leader of the 21st century. He should be regarded as the worst. Perhaps the college presidents could learn a valuable lesson from the sight of him in an orange jumpsuit.\n\n\nThe second target should be the University of California, Los Angeles. UCLA’s …\n\n\nEnforcing Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard; he first step should be forcing Harvard University to comply. Right after the decision was issued, Harvard all but publicly vowed to do everything in its power to violate the spirit of the Supreme Court’s ruling and the 14th Amendment on which it was based. McMahon should initiate a never-ending compliance review to ensure that Harvard follows the law. … If OCR finds a shred of evidence of racial discrimination, Harvard should lose its Title IV funds. I\n\n\nAnd so many other universities have essentially forfeited the privilege of picking their own professors.\n\n\nThe University of Washington and UIC should be forced to pay back wages to every single white applicant they declined to hire over a DEI statement and hire as many as would still like to work there. … However, it could demand all documents and correspondence on hiring in every university faculty department that implemented DEI statements. It could then train an artificial intelligence model to sort through the records and flag likely discrimination. Trump staffers could then send internal, FOIA-able correspondence regarding hot spots of likely discrimination. … Enterprising trial attorneys could team up with starving adjunct professors, and universities could be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement fees. That would teach them a painful lesson: Hiring based on race rather than academic merit comes at a very high cost.\n\n\nHow Trump can Destroy DEI on Campus – it’s all stereotyping. DEI violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment when stereotyping is institutionalized and promoted in an educational institution receiving federal funding — or so the Trump administration should hold and enforce. … To assure compliance with the 14th Amendment, McMahon could task accreditors with ensuring that students aren’t forced to take DEI-infused courses to graduate. This would, essentially, take Florida’s policy of removing DEI from general education requirements national. When students aren’t forced to take these courses, far fewer will, and the radical Marxists will lose students and influence. … McMahon could also champion college students’ First Amendment rights by forcing colleges to dismantle their so-called “Bias Reporting Systems.” More than half of colleges encourage students to snitch on each other for saying something “biased,” and students suspected of wrong speak are then hauled in front of a campus tribunal of DEI administrators.\n\n\nShaking Up College Accreditation – Trump suggested he would simply fire all the existing accreditors. That could prove prohibitively difficult. But Trump could easily decimate the worst of them: the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. … Trump could also easily expedite the approval of additional accreditors. These accreditors could provide a much more streamlined, cost-effective, outcomes-oriented paradigm than the existing set. They could also specialize in helping to launch new colleges, such as the University of Austin, and even newer ones that no one has dreamed up yet. Musk University? Thiel Technical College?\n\n\nA New Kind of Public College What about the American Academy? Experts laughed when Trump proposed launching a new, federally backed college. But former President George Washington wanted one. … At absolute minimum, the American Academy could offer a two-year, high-quality core curriculum, and sympathetic states could mandate their flagship universities accept transfer credit. The Universities of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the like could hoover up students who might otherwise have spent far bigger bucks on a private university with a similar prestige level.\n\n\nThese are just some ideas, and they’re just mine. And, of course, there’s far more the next Trump Education Department should and can do — it just wouldn’t be prudent to broadcast those ideas ahead of time, lest universities take defensive measures.\n\n\nTrump Administration Wants to Install Federal Oversight of Columbia University - The Wall Street Journal. (Thanks KB)\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-consent-decree-trump-federal-funding-2f4c4690?st=nRCE68\n\nA consent decree would be a major escalation of how the federal government normally resolves education-related civil-rights issues. Typically after federal lawyers investigate and find evidence that civil rights were violated, schools enter voluntary agreements to change their practices. The federal government has little ability to enforce such agreements. The Biden administration entered into such voluntary agreements over antisemitism concerns with Brown University and Rutgers.\n\n\nColumbia could fight the move in court; the Justice Department would need to prove that the arrangement is warranted. But a court case could take years, and Columbia would likely lose federal funding in the interim—and might ultimately lose. Opposing the move would also open the school up to required depositions and legal fact-finding, which could keep the school’s campus politics in the spotlight.",

He has won some early policy victories, and he will win more. Nonetheless, he faces real constraints on his power. Indeed, the most likely path to American autocracy depends on not only a power-hungry president but also the voluntary capitulation of a cowed civil society.

The National Institutes of Health normally provides billions of dollars to universities every year for medical and public-health research. Proposed cuts to that funding are now being challenged in courts. In the meantime, some schools have rescinded admission offers to graduate students.\n\n\nWhile many faculty members argue universities shouldn’t yield to Trump, they are in a tricky spot. It isn’t uncommon for a quarter or more of the operating budget of a large university to come from federal sources in the forms of student loans, Pell Grants and research funding—research that supporters say goes on to produce innovations and fuel the broader economy.\n\n\nTrump’s actions constitute a “war on civil society,” Roth [Wesleyan PResident] has told Connecticut lawmakers.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s insecurity state\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4izVKU2\n\n[Trump post] While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House House Governor’s Conference,” he posted, “we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases.

Apparently failing to understand that extortion is rarely a one-time deal, the university agreed to the concessions. (Sure enough, a senior Justice Department official indicated in a recent radio interview that more concessions would be needed.)\n\n\nSo much of what orbits the president is held in place by the gravitational pull of his insecurity.\n\n\nColumbia Capitulated — But So Did the Rest of Higher Ed (Thanks Kimora)\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/columbia-capitulated-but-so-did-the-rest-of-higher-ed\n\n“Unless higher education discovers its collective nerve and collective voice, those who “threaten the very mission of the university and its values of free inquiry” will get precisely what they want. And if it allows such a thing to happen without putting up more of a fight in defense of its mission and social purpose, higher education — it deeply pains me to acknowledge — will get what it deserves.”\n\n\nThis is why all our statements on academic freedom are important. My hope is that they give our political and university leaders some pause before they violate academic freedom as easily as they recently did at Hunter. Moreover, they show how each governing body is dealing with the challenges to higher education, and thus preparing their constituents for the challenges to come.\n\n(Thanks EI)\n\nNYTimes: University of Michigan to Scuttle Its Flagship D.E.I.

And in a lot of respects, this is worse,” he said. “These first two months have been much more aggressively authoritarian than almost any other comparable case I know of democratic backsliding.”\n\n\nTrump can’t fix American universities by breaking them\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4bOsq9T\n\nFlorida pioneered the kind of crackdown the Trump administration is attempting, and now more left-leaning students and professors in that state have begun describing exactly the kind of speech-chilling atmosphere that conservatives have been complaining about for years. Professors there have steered students away from discussing topics that seem forbidden, including “intersectionality,” and are afraid that students are recording them, the Wall Street Journal has reported. Students voiced similar fears that classmates would broadcast their remarks on social media, and one student publication trimmed its coverage to protect its funding\n\n\nNYTimes: $15 Billion Is Enough to Fight a President\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/trump-university-endowment-spending.html\n\nThus far, university presidents have largely kept their heads down rather than uniting to oppose Mr. Trump’s assault. That is a mistake. A key authoritarian strategy is to single out prominent individuals or institutions for repression so that others, afraid, forgo legitimate criticism of the authoritarian leader. Often, universities are some of the first institutions that authoritarians attack. Make no mistake, the Trump administration’s punitive cuts to federal research grants and detention of university students or faculty, couched under the President’s grievances over diversity programs and campus protests, are early signs of this strategy at work in America.\n\n\nLegal scholars on what Columbia University should have done — and what other colleges could do next.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/it-is-remarkable-how-quickly-the-chill-has-descended\n\nwith the exceptions of the presidents of Brown and Princeton, the leadership of academia has been pretty much absent; everyone is taking a duck-and-cover attitude. So Armstrong [Columbia’s President] felt she was on her own. That’s my most sympathetic read, even though I wish she had taken a firmer stand.\n\n\nSo there’s this very rational cost-benefit analysis where administrators are thinking, “Well, if we speak up and others do not …” It’s a collective-action problem in which, in the moment, it’s always easier not to speak. This is why we have free-speech protections — speech is easily chilled. It is remarkable how quickly the chill has descended.\n\n\nA less sympathetic reading: My sense of what was motivating both the Paul Weiss and Columbia leadership is a view that the concessions being demanded were not very significant.\n\n\nThat in itself is a significant indication of where we are. I’ve been reading all the free-speech policies at different schools. There’s lovely language in the policies about how universities are sites of dissent and how protest is meant to be valued. About how we want to give our students the freedom to question what is in the classroom and what’s outside the classroom. Chicago has a wonderful statement written by David Strauss, who was the head of the ad-hoc committee on protest and dissent, in which he says protest is not only integral to the life of the university because we are a community of dissent, but administrators should strive to problem-solve. So when students break the rules, don’t use discipline. Try to figure out what the cause of their concern is. Since October 7, there has been a demise of that kind of talking and that kind of imagining.\n\n\nIt feels like we are saying goodbye to this beautiful democratic vision of the university and we are now thinking of the university as a place where order must be maintained.\n\n\nThis Time, Higher Ed’s Resistance to Trump is Being Led by Its Associations\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/this-time-higher-eds-resistance-to-trump-is-being-led-by-its-associations\n(The board of ACE is chaired by CUNY’s Chancellor.)\n\nin opening remarks at ACE’s annual conference, Mitchell [ACE’s President] condemned Trump’s actions in unusually strong words. “The flurry of these threats,” he said, “were designed to cow us into silence. When we face threats, we will not cower.”\n\n\nTo Todd Wolfson, president of the AAUP, doing so [joining a lawsuite] was a necessity. “It’s our job to protect our members and to protect their places of employment and their sector,” he said. “If somebody wants to argue with me that’s not the role of unions and associations, I’d love to hear it. But I think this is a fundamental duty of ours, if not the fundamental duty.”\n\n\nNYTimes: David Leonhardt on How Universities Can Stop Trump’s ‘Destroying Agenda’\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/opinion/universities-trump-fight-back.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLeonhardt: It’s important to say that a lot of the conservative critics of universities, including Christopher Rufo, also don’t want a fully open debate. They want to restrict debate in many cases so that it’s just their view of the world. They want to take books out of schools about L.G.B.T. people. That’s really damaging.\n\n\nA world in which Donald Trump’s ideological enforcers are going through a course catalog or telling schools exactly what their admissions policies need to be, rather than letting schools follow the Supreme Court ruling on it, would be a really damaging world.\n\n\nI think we’re on track at a lot of universities and also law firms and other institutions that you’ve written about where people are going to say: Well, can I make a deal with Trump or can I keep my head down and stay out of the line of fire? Maybe not appreciating that this guy and the people around him like Chris Rufo are on a war footing.\n\n\nDear Colleagues: The Time for Boldness Is Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/03/27/letter-faculty-self-censorship-and-boldness-opinion\n\nI do not deny that we are living in perilous times, but what good are academic freedom and tenure if we do not use them? Some think, I believe mistakenly, that speaking out will only embolden the attacks on higher education institutions and faculty. I, instead, am more compelled by Frederick Douglass’s proclamation, “Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted …”\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: U.S. Lodges New Accusations Against Detained Columbia Protest Leader\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-trump-allegations.html\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be using the new allegations in part to sidestep the First Amendment issues raised by Mr. Khalil’s case. On Sunday, in a filing opposing his release, Justice Department lawyers argued that the new allegations reduced the importance of concerns about Mr. Khalil’s right to free speech.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow an Accreditation War Could Start\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-an-accreditation-war-could-start\n\nNow President Trump threatens to wield accreditation as a weapon, something which, if carried out, would muzzle the creativity and innovation that has fueled America’s lead.\n\n\nWhat stands in Trump’s way? The federal law establishing the Department of Education prohibits federal interference in curricular matters. That federal law would change, however, if the department is eliminated.\n\n\nAnother obstacle is the First Amendment: If the administration were to directly attack accreditors’ opinions or academic perspectives, they would expose themselves to legal challenges. The administration could respond to this by claiming a national-security concern (say, holding that diversity, equity, and inclusion are part of a Marxist threat to America).\n\n\nIf you have stories you would like me to include in anticipated future digests, please send along via an email to me directly (john.verzani@csi.cuny.edu).",

Trump was inaugurated, a senior scientist at the National Institutes of Health was preparing to give an invited talk at a scientific meeting when an urgent call came in from an administrative assistant.\n\n\nThere is a total communications ban, the scientist was told, and you cannot give the speech.\n\n\nAs soon as the scientist got back to the office, another ban went into effect — one that prohibited researchers from submitting papers to journals for publication.\n\n\nOne said that DOGE had begun a reign of “chaos and confusion.”\n\n\nHundreds of highly competitive grants that support research at universities and medical schools across the country have been cut. Many of the eliminated grants had descriptions that included terms like “minorities,” “transgender,” “AIDS” and “vaccine hesitancy.” But cuts have also affected research on the chronic diseases that Mr. Kennedy has made his priority; for instance, funding has been cut for a grant to Columbia University for a study that has followed people who have diabetes or are at risk of developing it for more than a quarter-century\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Faculty Protests as Trump Officials Hail University Concessions\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/columbia-trump-response.html\n\nEarlier on Monday, at least 50 professors turned out in a steady drizzle outside the campus gates to protest the funding cuts and what they criticized as Columbia’s conciliatory response. The professors said they hoped to be the vanguard of a resistance movement among academics that remains, for now, at an early stage.\n\n\n“We need to stand up, all of us,” said Michael Thaddeus, a mathematics professor at Columbia and vice president of the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors, speaking to the crowd. “We need to organize, from the grass roots to the national level. If we lead, our leaders will follow.”\n\nNYTimes: ‘It Is Hard to Imagine a More Sweeping Agenda to Make Americans Less Healthy’\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/trump-toxins-cancer-environment.html\nScroll down to find\n\nTurning to the issue of medical research, Duke University provides a case study of the problems facing higher education institutions that are struggling to maintain research budgets under the Trump administration.\n\n\nDonald McDonnell, a professor of molecular cancer biology at Duke whose laboratory has received $40 million from N.I.H. over 30 years, told the A.P. that his lab is likely to go into the red because of the uncertainty of N.I.H. grants, forcing him to order layoffs: “The bottom line is, I can’t live, I can’t think in this chaos,” McDonnell said.\n\n\nThe threatened cuts, according to McDonnell, have endangered the next generation of researchers.

The EPA terminated the grant on Feb. 21, saying the “award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities,” according to an email reviewed by The Post.",

The National Institutes of Health normally provides billions of dollars to universities every year for medical and public-health research. Proposed cuts to that funding are now being challenged in courts. In the meantime, some schools have rescinded admission offers to graduate students.\n\n\nWhile many faculty members argue universities shouldn’t yield to Trump, they are in a tricky spot. It isn’t uncommon for a quarter or more of the operating budget of a large university to come from federal sources in the forms of student loans, Pell Grants and research funding—research that supporters say goes on to produce innovations and fuel the broader economy.\n\n\nTrump’s actions constitute a “war on civil society,” Roth [Wesleyan PResident] has told Connecticut lawmakers.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s insecurity state\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4izVKU2\n\n[Trump post] While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House House Governor’s Conference,” he posted, “we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases.

And if it allows such a thing to happen without putting up more of a fight in defense of its mission and social purpose, higher education — it deeply pains me to acknowledge — will get what it deserves.”\n\n\nThis is why all our statements on academic freedom are important. My hope is that they give our political and university leaders some pause before they violate academic freedom as easily as they recently did at Hunter. Moreover, they show how each governing body is dealing with the challenges to higher education, and thus preparing their constituents for the challenges to come.\n\n(Thanks EI)\n\nNYTimes: University of Michigan to Scuttle Its Flagship D.E.I.

But I think this is a fundamental duty of ours, if not the fundamental duty.”\n\n\nNYTimes: David Leonhardt on How Universities Can Stop Trump’s ‘Destroying Agenda’\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/opinion/universities-trump-fight-back.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLeonhardt: It’s important to say that a lot of the conservative critics of universities, including Christopher Rufo, also don’t want a fully open debate. They want to restrict debate in many cases so that it’s just their view of the world. They want to take books out of schools about L.G.B.T. people. That’s really damaging.\n\n\nA world in which Donald Trump’s ideological enforcers are going through a course catalog or telling schools exactly what their admissions policies need to be, rather than letting schools follow the Supreme Court ruling on it, would be a really damaging world.\n\n\nI think we’re on track at a lot of universities and also law firms and other institutions that you’ve written about where people are going to say: Well, can I make a deal with Trump or can I keep my head down and stay out of the line of fire? Maybe not appreciating that this guy and the people around him like Chris Rufo are on a war footing.\n\n\nDear Colleagues: The Time for Boldness Is Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/03/27/letter-faculty-self-censorship-and-boldness-opinion\n\nI do not deny that we are living in perilous times, but what good are academic freedom and tenure if we do not use them? Some think, I believe mistakenly, that speaking out will only embolden the attacks on higher education institutions and faculty. I, instead, am more compelled by Frederick Douglass’s proclamation, “Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted …”",

Sadly another terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week. More tricks (re) employed: monkeying with grants; tax-exempt status; accreditation; student visas; and a Draconian proposed budget. Atleast it seems clear – resistance is the only means forward.\n\n\n\nSeveral CUNY senates have passed alliance resolutions\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/my5g55jprx5o64r4vzus0/ABqQBAimqk_KN5t-EsUG8Ds/1.Mutual%20Defense%20Statements?dl=0&rlkey=zvsqtp7ev781y4rqqjti8xaho&subfolder_nav_tracking=1\nThese include BMCC, CCNY, Hostos, Hunter, QBCC, and the UFS XC.

We look to you for leadership and coalition-building during a time when the stakes have never been higher.\n\n\nWe ask all sixty institutions under government threat to unite in a coordinated, proactive defense.\n\n(~3009 signatories)\n\nAdvocating for Brown – What’s at stake | Office of the President | Brown University\n\nhttps://president.brown.edu/president/advocating-brown-whats-stake\n\nIt’s important to share what is at stake for Brown. The research funding cuts that Brown has already suffered are causing immediate harm, forcing us to reconfigure our operations and budget to address funding shortfalls. Any long-term cuts of significant magnitude would imperil, or possibly end, several areas of high-impact research at Brown. This would be devastating to Brown’s research community, including the undergraduate, graduate and medical students we teach, and the people, patients and communities that benefit from the results of our research.\n\n\nEven more concerning, since early April, Brown has not been reimbursed for any expenses associated with active (i.e., not terminated) grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), whose grants make up roughly 70% of Brown’s overall research portfolio. Again, we have not been given any official explanation for why expenses for active grants are not being reimbursed. These unreimbursed expenses, which amount to millions of dollars per week, represent a significant threat to Brown’s financial sustainability and its ability to conduct federally funded research.\n\n\nAs we navigate the current environment, I continue to share a set of core principles:\n\n\nBrown will always defend the ability for students and scholars to teach and learn without fear of government intrusion or censorship, which is fundamental to efforts to protect academic freedom.\n\n\nBrown is deeply committed to following the law and maintaining an academic community where all can participate fully in the life of the institution. This means maintaining a campus that is free of all forms of harassment and discrimination for all community members, including addressing allegations of discrimination based on shared ancestry. We are proud of our initiatives to combat antisemitism, many of which we launched even before this became a major area of focus for the federal government.\n\n\nBrown will continue to provide resources and support to members of our international community.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Emerging From a Collective Silence, Universities Organize to Fight Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/us/trump-university-presidents.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nExclusive | Elite Universities Form Private Collective to Resist Trump Administration - WSJ\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/elite-universities-form-private-collective-to-resist-trump-administration-95a14ff3\n\nThe Resistance Is Here\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/29/resistance-here\n\nSince then [Harvard saying “no”], a group of more than 500 higher ed leaders signed a statement, released by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, opposing “undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses.” Presidents of highly selective universities, threatened by some of the most severe federal funding cuts, have reportedly developed a network to agree on shared boundaries and talk strategy. And faculty members at the Big Ten universities are ramping up pressure on their institutions to collaborate and defend one another against threats from the administration.\n\n\nMore and More Faculty Groups Want Their Colleges to Stand Together Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/more-and-more-faculty-groups-want-their-colleges-to-stand-together-against-trump\n\nFaculty senates across the nation are endorsing the idea of standing collectively against the actions of the Trump administration. Ten of the Big Ten’s 18 member institutions have adopted resolutions in recent weeks calling for an alliance among that group’s members, and on Saturday the State University of New York’s University Faculty Senate also endorsed a mutual-defense compact.\n\n\nWithin the City University of New York system, the Senates at Hunter College, Hostos Community College, and the City College of New York have done the same for a New York-based effort.\n\n\nSupport for mutual-defense compacts has come alongside several other efforts to stand against the Trump administration’s actions, among them the AAC&U statement condemning “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe, which now has been signed by more than 500 higher-ed leaders.\n\n\nPresidents and trustees from about 10 institutions have also formed an informal private collective to discuss possible responses to the administration, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The Journal did not name those institutions but noted that they included Ivy League campuses and top private research universities, primarily in blue states.\n\n\nA call for unity among researchers, libraries, publishers, journalists and the public in fighting the Trump administration.\n\nhttps://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2025/04/30/trump-v-research-how-we-could-turn-the-threats-into-opportunities/\n(Thanks BE!)\n\n“while it’s encouraging to see some organizations coming together within their existing siloes, that’s not enough. There’s a real opportunity – and imperative – for all stakeholders in the research community to join forces. Each group plays a vital role in the research endeavor. Now is the time to show our support for everyone’s contributions, and to help everyone understand that, by dismantling the research infrastructure through censorship and defunding, we hamper research progress and its benefits in the US and across the world. We call on the industry bodies that represent all these different stakeholders to leverage their relationships and networks to develop something that’s bigger than just a campaign — a movement that spans all individuals and organizations working to fund, conduct, support, and disseminate the science and scholarship essential for our survival and success.\n\n\n“So let’s set aside our usual disagreements (open access business models, pricing, copyright, etc., etc.) to focus on what’s really important right now.

When Mr. Trump began threatening the university with canceled funds this spring, many Harvard professors and students urged administrators to head straight to the ramparts and denounce him. Alan Garber, Harvard’s president, took a wiser approach. He acknowledged that some of Mr. Trump’s criticisms had merit. Harvard, like much of elite higher education, has, in fact, been blasé about antisemitism, and it has too often prioritized progressive ideology over an independent search for truth.\n\n\nBy admitting as much, Mr. Garber strengthened Harvard’s political position. He said what many Americans believed. But when the administration issued a list of ludicrous demands, Harvard fought back hard. It filed a lawsuit, with help from a legal team that included conservative litigators, and became a national symbol of resistance to his lawlessness. Mr. Garber made Harvard look reasonable and Mr. Trump unreasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Road Map of Trump’s Lawless Presidency, According to 35 Legal Scholars\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/opinion/trump-constitution-rule-of-law.html?unlocked_article_code=1.DE8.cUMD.AE-5Mjxg6jlf&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe disregard for law is itself part of the agenda. They do not seem to care whether they violate the Constitution and statutes, make mistakes, do irreparable harm. That recklessness itself sends a message. — Jody Freeman, professor, Harvard Law School\n\n\nUniversities, law firms, public schools, et cetera, are being attacked because of their political views: their opposition to the president, their adoption of D.E.I. policies, their liberalism more generally. These moves flout the cardinal rule of the First Amendment, which is that the government can’t punish people because of their political speech. — Nicholas Stephanopoulos, professor, Harvard Law School\n\n\nRefusing to spend funds appropriated by Congress violates separation of powers in usurping Congress’s spending power and violates the Impoundment Control Act. — Erwin Chemerinsky, dean, University of California, Berkeley, School of Law\n\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nThe 50-Year Wwar On Higher Education\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-50-year-war-on-higher-education\n\nTo understand what’s happening, you need to see how the backlash against higher education began. You need to trace its roots in the 1960s, its evolution through the culture wars of the 1980s and ’90s, and into the current populist fray. Then you need to do something about it. Professors, administrators, students, and concerned citizens can no longer stand on the sidelines, shaking our heads and deploring the potentially devastating consequences. The simple truth is this: For decades, outside forces have — both consciously and unintentionally — undermined the integrity and quality of public higher education in America. And time and time again, a divided academic community has failed to combat them effectively. We can and must do better. Seeds of resistance are sprouting. Together, we must nurture their growth. There is no time to lose.\n\n(Though it was written in 2022, this is an excellent historic overview beginning with Reagan’s rise on the backs of student protestors at UC Berkeley.)\n\n\n\n\nNEJM Gets Letter From DOJ | MedPage Today\n\nhttps://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/115256\n(Thanks KB)\n\nNEJM Editor-in-Chief Eric Rubin, MD, PhD, received a letter from Edward R.

Demonstrators began forming a tent encampment, the paper reported.\n\n\nA university spokesperson told the Yale Daily News the assembly was violating time, place and manner protest restrictions, and administrators gave final warnings to disperse around 11 p.m. The encampment dissolved before midnight, the paper reported.\n\n\nSenate Committee Postpones Vote on Antisemitism Awareness Act\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/01/senate-committee-postpones-vote-antisemitism-awareness-act\n\nThe committee’s Republican chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, called off the planned vote after the Democratic minority won enough Republican support to pass several amendments aimed at more clearly distinguishing what qualifies as discriminatory speech and protecting the First Amendment rights of pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\n\nFor instance, some of the proposed amendments included clarifying that it is not antisemitic to oppose the “devastation of Gaza,” or to criticize Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as preventing the revocation of visas based on “protected conduct under the First Amendment.” Lawmakers also sought to ensure students and faculty members could protest as long as they don’t incite violence.\n\n\nBut Democrats and Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky said the amendments were necessary to ensure that while objecting to bigotry and discrimination, this bill also upheld the constitutional right to peaceful protest. (Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, also supported some of the amendments.)\n\n\n“The problem is if you look at the IHRA’s examples of speech, they are going to be limiting on campuses everything on that list … protected by the First Amendment,” Paul said. “The First Amendment isn’t about protecting good speech; it protects even the most despicable and vile speech.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Administration Reverses Course on Student Visa Cancellations - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/us/politics/trump-student-visa-cancellations.html\n\nTrump administration reverses abrupt terminations of foreign students’ US visa registrations\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/25/trump-admin-reverses-termination-foreign-student-visa-registrations-00309407\n\nThe Justice Department announced the wholesale reversal in federal court Friday after weeks of intense scrutiny by courts and dozens of restraining orders issued by judges who deemed the mass termination of students from a federal database — used by universities and the federal government to track foreign students in the U.S. — as flagrantly illegal.\n\nMaybe they could have “illegal” in the headline; though their email reports:\n\nIt took more than 100 lawsuits and 50 restraining orders from dozens of federal judges. But after 20 days of court losses, the Trump administration capitulated, reversing a decision that threatened the legal status of thousands of foreign students in the United States.\n\n\nInternational Students Who Lost Their Immigration Status Will Have It Restored, Government Says\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/thousands-of-international-students-will-see-their-immigration-status-restored-government-says\n\nMany of those students have already left the country.

It’s also announced a plan to cap indirect research cost rates, which universities say would create gaping budget holes and slow the pace of medical breakthroughs. (A federal judge has since blocked the guidance.)\n\n\nThe agency has also fired some 1,300 employees and terminated roughly $2 billion in grants—many focused on the health of women, LGBTQ+ people and racial minorities—that no longer effectuate “agency priorities.” (Researchers have since sued over the grant terminations).

With labs, dormitories, lecture halls, athletic facilities, and so much else, colleges have exorbitant fixed costs. Those fixed costs have typically been covered in large part by student enrollment. Now that enrollment is declining, higher education’s cost curve is breaking. No amount of cutting will fix the underlying problem. Many colleges have masked their operating deficiencies by using Covid-relief funds in the past few years, but now, with those funds exhausted, they are dealing with a broken economic model. The Trump administration’s cuts to research funding are adding additional stress to colleges’ already precarious cost structure.\n\n\nMore damaging than the cost curve is the shift in how students view the value of higher education. Having grown up with Amazon, Netflix, and Google, students expect a speedy, on-demand, and low-friction experience. Moreover, they increasingly view college through a transactional lens: They pursue a degree to get a job. So they regard college much like any other consumer product, and like those other products, they expect it to be delivered how they want, when they want. Why wouldn’t they?\n\nI’d quote the next line, but it ends with “AI is going to decimate faculty ranks”… But I will quote this one:\n\nThe big mistake faculty members make is underestimating the existential threat AI represents to their livelihoods.\n\n\nIs Your Online Student a Bot?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/is-your-online-student-a-bot\n(Following an article K had shared earlier)\n\n\n\n\nAs Harvard fights Trump, one campus quietly prepares for the worst\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/27/gwu-harvard-trump-antisemitism/\n\nWe Don’t Have to Hand It to Harvard\n\nhttps://www.thenation.com/article/society/harvard-university-trump-lawsuit-palestine-academic-integrity/\n\nTheir dismissal has been widely condemned as a flagrant act of censorship.

The report said that bias incidents had been occurring before the Hamas attack and were intensified by the war in Gaza. It found that antisemitism seemed to be more pronounced in branches of the university with a social justice bent, including the graduate school of education, the divinity school and the school of public health.\n\n\nA similar task force held hundreds of conversations with Muslim, Arab and Palestinian students, staff and faculty members about anti-Muslim bias. That task force summed up the feelings expressed by many of those people in two words: “abandoned and silenced.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Doesn’t Want to Protect All Jewish Students — Just Those on His Team\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/opinion/jewish-student-protesters-gaza.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(For distinctions in position between different Jewish organizations like ADL and Jewish Voice for Peace)\n\nNYTimes: Harvard, Under Pressure, Revamps D.E.I.

The university’s president, James E. Ryan, said the move signaled that “becoming a more diverse, equitable place is both the right and the smart thing to do.”\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the board voted unanimously to rescind any such numerical goals as part of a sweeping effort to wipe out evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The Trump administration had warned university officials, only the day before, that it had received complaints that the university wasn’t acting fast enough to carry through on its promise to “dismantle DEI apparatuses.”\n\n\nIn its letter on Monday, the Justice Department said the president had failed to produce a sufficiently detailed progress report. (A campus spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about whether the required report had been submitted.) It demanded that Ryan and Hardie certify by Friday that the vestiges of DEI have been removed from every division, department, program, and school.\n\n\nThe Board of Visitors deliberated during a closed session on Tuesday. The public portion of the meeting was not live-streamed. It’s unclear whether the board brought up the fact that Ryan, who became president in 2018, was one of more than 550 higher-education leaders who signed a statement circulated by the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) that condemned “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe.\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate was concerned enough about the board’s reaction that on Monday, it passed a resolution supporting Ryan and his decision to sign the AAC&U statement, saying it “expresses principles that are essential to upholding UVA’s mission, reputation, and operations.”\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate had encouraged Ryan to collaborate with other university presidents to promote higher education’s contributions to the nation. Ryan’s signature, it said, reaffirmed the university’s established policies on institutional statements and free expression. The former discourages the university from commenting on social or political issues “unless the matter directly affects the university’s mission or operations.”\n\n\nTrump’s 100-Day War on Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/30/how-trumps-first-100-days-transformed-higher-ed\n10 things done such as “Pursuing Punishment as Policy” and “Breeding Financial Uncertainty” and “Tanking America’s Global Stature”.

Rufo’s culture war. Ironically, none of these three people are Trump appointees themselves. But the confluence and conflict among them will determine the course of a White House that moves forward decisively when there is internal consensus but swerves erratically when major players fight over the steering wheel.\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

We look to you for leadership and coalition-building during a time when the stakes have never been higher.\n\n\nWe ask all sixty institutions under government threat to unite in a coordinated, proactive defense.\n\n(~3009 signatories)\n\nAdvocating for Brown – What’s at stake | Office of the President | Brown University\n\nhttps://president.brown.edu/president/advocating-brown-whats-stake\n\nIt’s important to share what is at stake for Brown. The research funding cuts that Brown has already suffered are causing immediate harm, forcing us to reconfigure our operations and budget to address funding shortfalls. Any long-term cuts of significant magnitude would imperil, or possibly end, several areas of high-impact research at Brown. This would be devastating to Brown’s research community, including the undergraduate, graduate and medical students we teach, and the people, patients and communities that benefit from the results of our research.\n\n\nEven more concerning, since early April, Brown has not been reimbursed for any expenses associated with active (i.e., not terminated) grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), whose grants make up roughly 70% of Brown’s overall research portfolio. Again, we have not been given any official explanation for why expenses for active grants are not being reimbursed. These unreimbursed expenses, which amount to millions of dollars per week, represent a significant threat to Brown’s financial sustainability and its ability to conduct federally funded research.\n\n\nAs we navigate the current environment, I continue to share a set of core principles:\n\n\nBrown will always defend the ability for students and scholars to teach and learn without fear of government intrusion or censorship, which is fundamental to efforts to protect academic freedom.\n\n\nBrown is deeply committed to following the law and maintaining an academic community where all can participate fully in the life of the institution. This means maintaining a campus that is free of all forms of harassment and discrimination for all community members, including addressing allegations of discrimination based on shared ancestry. We are proud of our initiatives to combat antisemitism, many of which we launched even before this became a major area of focus for the federal government.\n\n\nBrown will continue to provide resources and support to members of our international community."

Ten of the Big Ten’s 18 member institutions have adopted resolutions in recent weeks calling for an alliance among that group’s members, and on Saturday the State University of New York’s University Faculty Senate also endorsed a mutual-defense compact.\n\n\nWithin the City University of New York system, the Senates at Hunter College, Hostos Community College, and the City College of New York have done the same for a New York-based effort.\n\n\nSupport for mutual-defense compacts has come alongside several other efforts to stand against the Trump administration’s actions, among them the AAC&U statement condemning “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe, which now has been signed by more than 500 higher-ed leaders.\n\n\nPresidents and trustees from about 10 institutions have also formed an informal private collective to discuss possible responses to the administration, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.

Now is the time to show our support for everyone’s contributions, and to help everyone understand that, by dismantling the research infrastructure through censorship and defunding, we hamper research progress and its benefits in the US and across the world. We call on the industry bodies that represent all these different stakeholders to leverage their relationships and networks to develop something that’s bigger than just a campaign — a movement that spans all individuals and organizations working to fund, conduct, support, and disseminate the science and scholarship essential for our survival and success.\n\n\n“So let’s set aside our usual disagreements (open access business models, pricing, copyright, etc., etc.) to focus on what’s really important right now.

When Mr. Trump began threatening the university with canceled funds this spring, many Harvard professors and students urged administrators to head straight to the ramparts and denounce him. Alan Garber, Harvard’s president, took a wiser approach. He acknowledged that some of Mr. Trump’s criticisms had merit. Harvard, like much of elite higher education, has, in fact, been blasé about antisemitism, and it has too often prioritized progressive ideology over an independent search for truth.\n\n\nBy admitting as much, Mr. Garber strengthened Harvard’s political position. He said what many Americans believed. But when the administration issued a list of ludicrous demands, Harvard fought back hard. It filed a lawsuit, with help from a legal team that included conservative litigators, and became a national symbol of resistance to his lawlessness. Mr. Garber made Harvard look reasonable and Mr. Trump unreasonable."

You need to trace its roots in the 1960s, its evolution through the culture wars of the 1980s and ’90s, and into the current populist fray. Then you need to do something about it. Professors, administrators, students, and concerned citizens can no longer stand on the sidelines, shaking our heads and deploring the potentially devastating consequences. The simple truth is this: For decades, outside forces have — both consciously and unintentionally — undermined the integrity and quality of public higher education in America. And time and time again, a divided academic community has failed to combat them effectively. We can and must do better. Seeds of resistance are sprouting. Together, we must nurture their growth.

But after 20 days of court losses, the Trump administration capitulated, reversing a decision that threatened the legal status of thousands of foreign students in the United States.\n\n\nInternational Students Who Lost Their Immigration Status Will Have It Restored, Government Says\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/thousands-of-international-students-will-see-their-immigration-status-restored-government-says\n\nMany of those students have already left the country.

It’s also announced a plan to cap indirect research cost rates, which universities say would create gaping budget holes and slow the pace of medical breakthroughs. (A federal judge has since blocked the guidance.)\n\n\nThe agency has also fired some 1,300 employees and terminated roughly $2 billion in grants—many focused on the health of women, LGBTQ+ people and racial minorities—that no longer effectuate “agency priorities.” (Researchers have since sued over the grant terminations).

Allow Ed Tech to offer more predatory degrees, then allow more admin friendly accreditors, then go after existing accreditors?)\n\n“As an accreditor with institutions that have been stalled in the process, this guidance will have a positive impact on the work we have been doing with several institutions. We look forward to helping our institutions understand what this may mean for them and for us,” MSCHE president Heather Perfetti wrote. “We appreciate that there are well-defined restrictions that will not allow for institutions to change accreditors to avoid accountability with an existing accreditor.”\n\n\nAre You Ready for the AI University?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/are-you-ready-for-the-ai-university\n\nIn the movie Blade Runner 2049, one of the characters (coincidentally an AI humanoid) says about the rise of AI: “You can’t hold the tide back with a broom.” We are at a tidal moment.\n\n\nColleges have traditionally relied on economies of scale to maintain their bottom lines. With labs, dormitories, lecture halls, athletic facilities, and so much else, colleges have exorbitant fixed costs. Those fixed costs have typically been covered in large part by student enrollment. Now that enrollment is declining, higher education’s cost curve is breaking. No amount of cutting will fix the underlying problem. Many colleges have masked their operating deficiencies by using Covid-relief funds in the past few years, but now, with those funds exhausted, they are dealing with a broken economic model. The Trump administration’s cuts to research funding are adding additional stress to colleges’ already precarious cost structure.\n\n\nMore damaging than the cost curve is the shift in how students view the value of higher education. Having grown up with Amazon, Netflix, and Google, students expect a speedy, on-demand, and low-friction experience. Moreover, they increasingly view college through a transactional lens: They pursue a degree to get a job. So they regard college much like any other consumer product, and like those other products, they expect it to be delivered how they want, when they want. Why wouldn’t they?\n\nI’d quote the next line, but it ends with “AI is going to decimate faculty ranks”… But I will quote this one:\n\nThe big mistake faculty members make is underestimating the existential threat AI represents to their livelihoods.\n\n\nIs Your Online Student a Bot?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/is-your-online-student-a-bot\n(Following an article K had shared earlier)"

The report said that bias incidents had been occurring before the Hamas attack and were intensified by the war in Gaza. It found that antisemitism seemed to be more pronounced in branches of the university with a social justice bent, including the graduate school of education, the divinity school and the school of public health.\n\n\nA similar task force held hundreds of conversations with Muslim, Arab and Palestinian students, staff and faculty members about anti-Muslim bias. That task force summed up the feelings expressed by many of those people in two words: “abandoned and silenced.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Doesn’t Want to Protect All Jewish Students — Just Those on His Team\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/opinion/jewish-student-protesters-gaza.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(For distinctions in position between different Jewish organizations like ADL and Jewish Voice for Peace)\n\nNYTimes: Harvard, Under Pressure, Revamps D.E.I.

The university’s president, James E. Ryan, said the move signaled that “becoming a more diverse, equitable place is both the right and the smart thing to do.”\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the board voted unanimously to rescind any such numerical goals as part of a sweeping effort to wipe out evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The Trump administration had warned university officials, only the day before, that it had received complaints that the university wasn’t acting fast enough to carry through on its promise to “dismantle DEI apparatuses.”\n\n\nIn its letter on Monday, the Justice Department said the president had failed to produce a sufficiently detailed progress report. (A campus spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about whether the required report had been submitted.) It demanded that Ryan and Hardie certify by Friday that the vestiges of DEI have been removed from every division, department, program, and school.\n\n\nThe Board of Visitors deliberated during a closed session on Tuesday. The public portion of the meeting was not live-streamed. It’s unclear whether the board brought up the fact that Ryan, who became president in 2018, was one of more than 550 higher-education leaders who signed a statement circulated by the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) that condemned “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe.\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate was concerned enough about the board’s reaction that on Monday, it passed a resolution supporting Ryan and his decision to sign the AAC&U statement, saying it “expresses principles that are essential to upholding UVA’s mission, reputation, and operations.”\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate had encouraged Ryan to collaborate with other university presidents to promote higher education’s contributions to the nation. Ryan’s signature, it said, reaffirmed the university’s established policies on institutional statements and free expression. The former discourages the university from commenting on social or political issues “unless the matter directly affects the university’s mission or operations.”\n\n\nTrump’s 100-Day War on Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/30/how-trumps-first-100-days-transformed-higher-ed\n10 things done such as “Pursuing Punishment as Policy” and “Breeding Financial Uncertainty” and “Tanking America’s Global Stature”.

Trump has demanded that at some universities, the federal government should be allowed to influence student admissions, faculty hiring, and the content of some academic departments. The federal government has already canceled $2.6 billion in research grants to Harvard, $400 million to Columbia University, and millions more to five other universities.\n\n\nIn a talk at the Berkeley City Club last Wednesday, Lyons addressed the assault on higher education, its impacts on Cal, the balance between free speech and the right for all students to feel safe on campus, and how the UC system is approaching this era, all while it is wondering and waiting if UC will get one of those dreaded “Columbia-Harvard letters” from the administration announcing draconian cuts.\n\n\nMore cuts may be coming. Leo Terrell, senior counsel at the Department of Justice and head of its antisemitism task force, said in a Fox TV interview in May that there will be “massive lawsuits against [the] UC system. … Expect hate crime charges filed by the federal government. Expect Title VII lawsuits.”\n\n\n“Has Berkeley turned a blind eye to antisemitism?” Lyons asked in a hypothetical question to the Berkeley City Club audience. “Have we been deliberately indifferent about antisemitism on campus? No way.”\n\n\nBut executive orders aren’t law, said Catherine Lhamon, former assistant secretary for civil rights in the U.S. Department of Education, at a journalism conference in May. “Executive orders bind federal agencies about what the president directs those federal agencies to do. They don’t create law.” When asked about Trump’s antisemitism executive order, she added that schools and colleges “have an opportunity to challenge that in court, and they are not bound by the administration’s interpretation.” Llamon was recently named executive director of the Edley Center on Law & Democracy at UC Berkeley Law.\n\n\nHe [David Cole, a professor at Georgetown Law] told the committee that antisemitism only violates Title VI in narrow circumstances: When the speech is targeting an individual’s Jewish identity and when the speech is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies equal access to an education.\n\n\n“That’s a very high standard,” Cole said in the hearing. “It’s almost never been met in the case law.”\n\n\n“To be honest, and with all due respect, the hearings this committee held on this same subject last year are reminiscent not of a fair trial of any sort, but of the kind of hearings the House Committee on Un-American Activities used to hold,” Cole said in his testimony. “And I think we can all agree that the HUAC hearings were both a big mistake and a major intrusion on the First Amendment rights of Americans.”\n\n\nThe House committee wants to know if the widespread protests against Israel’s war in Gaza were authentic or were orchestrated by outside forces.\n\n\n\n\n\nPSC Resolution Condemns Retaliatory Firing of CUNY Faculty\n\nhttps://psc-cuny.org/news-events/week/psc-condemns-retaliatory-firing-of-cuny-faculty-retro-for-part-timers/\n(The UFS XC and chairs of the AF committee also sent a letter to the Brooklyn College President).\n(The PSC Academic Freedom Committee has sent two letters)\n\nCUNY suspends student activist leader, fires four faculty members in escalation of repression against Palestine activism\n\nhttps://mondoweiss.net/2025/07/cuny-suspends-student-activist-leader-fires-four-faculty-members-in-escalation-of-repression-against-palestine-activism/\n(Mondoweiss may not be the most impartial source of reporting)\n\nstudent organizer Hadeeqa Arzoo Malik has been suspended for a year.

Baylor has a duty to protect and uphold the integrity of scientific inquiry, allowing its world class faculty to investigate complex issues without fear of reprisal based on shifting political winds. Pulling the rug out from under its faculty after those researchers have already put the grueling work into securing funding, work they undertook with Baylor’s full knowledge and approval, is a chilling affront to the very concept of academic freedom. Stymying research and opportunity will inevitably lead the best and brightest students and faculty to other universities where their work and their freedom will be valued and protected.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo save themselves, universities must cultivate civic friendship\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/30/universities-trump-survival-free-speech/\n\nWe believe a fundamental reason for the decline of the pursuit of truth on campuses is the collapse in acknowledging the importance of civic friendship — which, following Aristotle, we understand to be the bond of mutual respect and willingness to cooperate for the sake of the common good, even across significant disagreements or divisions.\n\n\nThe cultivation and recovery of civic friendship must necessarily undergird any successful effort by universities to regain public legitimacy and the moral high ground. Here, we hope to provide some guidance for restoring campus cultures where faculty and students feel free to speak their minds and explore ideas, no matter how unpopular or controversial on or off campus they happen to be.\n\n\nThis is because universities that do not model and actively foster civic friendship become ideological seminaries, sending into the world graduates who have been trained to be zealots for particular causes rather than formed as dispassionate and determined truth-seekers.\n\n\nThey call for the principled defense of freedom of speech and the consistent enforcement of rules against speech-chilling behaviors such as harassment and the shouting-down of speakers, as well as any activities that disrupt core academic priorities such as teaching, studying and research. And they demand a commitment by university leaders to ensuring that seminar rooms and lecture halls are not “safe spaces” but rather Socratic Spaces, where students are made to wrestle with ideas that challenge their preconceived assumptions and deeply held beliefs — indeed, ideas which might make them feel uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\nNIH cancels sickle cell research grant, citing DEI, doctor says – NBC4 Washington\n\nhttps://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/nih-cuts-study-on-disease-that-affects-mostly-black-patients-citing-dei-doctor-says/3948371/\n\nA doctor says she’s scrambling to figure out how she’ll continue her work helping sickle cell disease patients after the National Institutes of Health cancelled her $750,000 research grant, citing diversity, equity and inclusion and divisiveness as a factor.\n\n\nSickle cell disease affects about 100,000 people in the U.S., and 90% of patients are Black, according to NIH.\n\n\nBut two weeks ago, the NIH told her it’s taking away her funding, citing a “low return on investment.” It also said studies involving DEI “support unlawful discrimination on the basis of race … which harms the health of Americans.”\n\n\nColleges, companies and philanthropic groups are retooling millions of dollars in scholarships that for years supported minority students\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/anti-dei-minority-scholarships-a721ba1b?st=h3S9TL&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nColleges, companies and philanthropic organizations are retooling millions of dollars in scholarships that for years supported minority students.\n\n\nUnder threat from the Trump administration and activist groups over diversity programs, some are scrapping scholarships entirely. Others are broadening the programs to focus on low-income students in general or tweaking applications to try to keep their original missions.\n\n\n“We’re seeing widespread fear of litigation prompt many scholarship providers to re-evaluate,” said Jackie Bright, president of the National Scholarship Providers Association.\n\n\nEducation experts said the changes could make it harder for minority students to graduate from college. “There’s going to be a decline in college affordability and completion rates for those students,” Bright said.\n\n\nEdward Blum [for your bingo card], whose group was behind the lawsuit that led to the 2023 Supreme Court decision that banned affirmative action, also brought the McDonald’s lawsuit.\n\n\nNYTimes: How Trump’s D.E.I.

Those who have lost grants include not only Black and Latino scientists, but also many like Mr. Dillard, who are white and from rural areas, which are solidly Trump country. The administration has decried universities as hotbeds of liberal elitism, inhospitable to viewpoint diversity. The canceled diversity grant programs were intended to make science less elite, by developing a pipeline from poorer areas of the country that tend to be more conservative.\n\n\n“I think it’s very different in their minds, who is getting the D.E.I. stuff,” Mr. Dillard said. “People on the right, they don’t realize they’re limiting the opportunity of their own kids by supporting this.”\n\n\nMany young scientists talk about feeling betrayed by the places that raised them. “I’ve encountered a lot of callousness about my fellowship being terminated,” said Ms. Reneker, at Princeton. People back home tell her “there’s going to be some casualties along the way,” or “there must be some kind of misunderstanding.”\n\n\n“These are the kids we are supposed to be propping up,” the teacher, Greg Tucker, said. “It comes back to the whole Make America Great thing again.

Advocacy groups see the department’s decision to end the interest subsidy as a way to hasten that departure and say the move will harm millions of borrowers.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Lost Generation of Researchers\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-lost-generation-of-researchers\n\nWith that, Buan became one of thousands of early-career scholars who have become collateral damage amid policy changes at the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and other government agencies. As these agencies have sought to put caps on indirect funding, several doctoral programs paused or reduced admissions in February and March. Another wave of uncertainty hit weeks later, as the NIH and NSF terminated hundreds of existing grants, throwing many current doctoral and postdoctoral scholars’ funding into question. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year contains deep cuts to the NIH, NSF, and other federal agencies that support scientific research.\n\n\nAll told, the White House’s actions, many of which are tied up in court, could result in a lost generation of budding academics. Students are being forced to delay their graduate studies, continue them abroad, or forgo them entirely. The collective impact of those individual decisions is nearly impossible to measure, says Joanne Padrón Carney, chief governmental relations officer for the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\nhe NSF, for instance, awarded only 1,000 of its Graduate Research Fellowships this year, half of its usual total and the lowest number of awards in 15 years, according to Nature; the NIH canceled a slate of early-career programs. In a spring survey conducted by the American Institute of Physics, 37 percent of department chairs whose programs offer graduate degrees in physics and astronomy said they expected to enroll fewer graduate students in the fall of 2025 than they did last fall,\n\n\nWhat Does It Cost to Run a Lab?

The bill also sends about $10 million more to the National Weather Service and boosts funding for National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n(That is good news?)\n\nAlthough the science funding received bipartisan support, a fight over funding for the new Federal Bureau of Investigations headquarters could tank the legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: How to Wreck the Nation’s Health, by the Numbers\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/30/opinion/hhs-cuts-harming-american-health.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has terminated thousands of grants, including funding for pandemic prevention, and research grants related to cancer, vaccines and chronic diseases. The loss of research funding will delay medical discoveries. Though the agency publishes a weekly list of terminated grants, the full scope of funding cancellations has been obscured, especially at the National Institutes of Health, the major funder of medical research. A database created by Harvard researchers, Grant Watch, has helped to fill in the gaps.\n\n(See the great infographics)\n\nSince President Trump has taken office, H.H.S. has cut over $9.5 billion in grant funding that had been approved but not yet distributed to programs and researchers.

This article uses the Health Systems Performance Assessment Framework to identify key policies regarding resources, financing, governance, and service delivery and their impact on the cost, quality, access, and equity of the US health system. The evaluation is largely negative. The administration, in its very energetic first hundred days, has already undermined resources, financing, and in particular governance in areas as diverse as oversight of long-term care, scientific research, and vaccination policy. Administration rhetoric and budget proposals called for severe reductions in health care access and actions to terminate services for particular groups, such as immigrants or gender minorities. Many of the particular actions, such as mass layoffs of specialist scientific and regulatory staff, will be difficult to reverse.\n\n(On a grid with 64 options, 54 were colored harmful; none beneficial)\n\nShocks to specialist research communities cause rapid attrition, with scientists exiting the workforce and even the country after as little as a month of disrupted funding, and resources diverted from high-quality basic research to privately assigned, less-impactful work.17,18 They may also increase hesitancy around research participation, particularly for groups that are already under-represented in health research. One estimate suggests that the administration’s proposed NIH cuts, over 25 years, will save $500bn and cost the country $8.2 trillion in lost health-a cost more than 16 times greater than the savings, even excluding lost economic benefits from health research.\n\n\nAcross Table 1, the second Trump administration’s record is one of unprecedented damage. Budget proposals that were not enacted but started in the first hundred days would exacerbate the damage through enormous cuts to Medicaid, supplemental nutrition, HHS and NIH. Decentralizing responsibilities to the states will produce less efficiency (due to loss of economies of scale and specialist resources such as laboratories), more variation in state politics, resources, and risks, and more inequality between states.108 Trump is the least popular president in US polling history.109 It remains to be seen whether the majority of Americans will stand up and successfully demand that he change course to reflect their views.\n\n\nNIH Plans to Cap Publisher Fees, Dilute ‘Scientific Elite’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/07/10/nih-plans-cap-publisher-fees-dilute-scientific\n\nThe National Institutes of Health announced a plan Tuesday to implement a cap on the fees publishers can charge NIH-funded researchers to make their work publicly accessible.\n\n\nBoth the updated open-access policy and the NIH’s newly announced publisher fee cap, which takes effect next year, are designed to put some limits on the $19 billion for-profit scholarly publishing industry, which is dominated by a small group of for-profit megapublishers, including Elsevier, Taylor & Francis and Springer Nature. The industry thrives on the unpaid work of scholars—including thousands funded by the NIH and other federal agencies—who rely on publishing their research in prestigious journals to earn tenure, promotion and recognition as leaders in their fields.\n\n\n“I expect the response to this will be that these journals will lose some of their market power,” Bhattacharya told Charlie Kirk, founder of the right-wing group Turning Point USA, in an interview Tuesday. “A lot of their market power has to do with the fact that they bully scientists into paying large fees and essentially end up bullying us.”\n\n\nDuring the pandemic, Bhattacharya, who was a health economist at Stanford University before Trump appointed him director of the NIH, became one of the political right’s favorite examples of how the so-called scientific elite allegedly suppressed nonconformist scientific beliefs. In 2020, he criticized public officials’ recommendations for people to stay home to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus, sparking widespread backlash from other experts—including the officials running the NIH at the time.\n\n\nBut now that he’s in charge of the same agency that dismissed his views as “fringe” nearly five years ago, Bhattacharya has vowed to “establish a culture of respect for free speech in science and scientific dissent at the NIH.”\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation Department Postpones NACIQI Summer Meeting\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/08/education-department-postpones-naciqi-summer-meeting\n\nThe delay means that by the time the panel meets, the terms of six of its 18 members will have expired. The education secretary, House and Senate each appoint six members. In May, Education Secretary Linda McMahon requested nominations to fill six seats in October. Experts and members of the committee are worried that the Trump administration is trying to stack the panel in its favor as decisions about the future of higher education accreditation loom.\n\n\nThe panel, known as the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, advises the department on which independent agencies should have the power to accredit colleges and therefore which colleges should have access to federal aid. At the next meeting, NACIQI is scheduled to decide whether to renew recognition for the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the accreditor for Columbia University.\n\n\nPanel member and chair Zakiya Smith Ellis told the Journal that she is concerned that the Trump administration is “trying to take over this advisory group that is supposed to be in place for our expertise in higher education, not to push a certain political agenda.”\n\n\nFlorida Board of Governors to Vote on New Accreditor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/regional-public-universities/2025/07/11/fla-board-governors-vote-creating-new\n\nThe goal is to accredit six institutions by next summer and secure Department of Education recognition by June 2028, according to the business plan. (A new accreditor typically has two years to prove it is operating in accordance with federal regulations to receive federal approval.)\n\n\nThe Commission for Public Higher Education would be incorporated as a nonprofit organization in Florida, initially funded by a $4 million appropriation from the Florida State Legislature, according to the business plan. Other involved higher ed systems are expected to cough up similar funds. A board of directors representing each of the founding systems would oversee the new accreditor.\n\n\n“CHEA does not believe that states are likely to be effective accreditors,” she wrote. “Historically, states have not had the staff, experience, or knowledge necessary to create a higher education accreditor. It is critically important that higher education reflects an impartial and unbiased accrediting review process that is focused on student learning outcomes. To date, there has not been a state that has accomplished this.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourt Filing Sheds Light on Civil Rights Complaints Under Trump\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/08/trump-admin-dismisses-34k-civil-rights-complaints-3\n\nThe Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights dismissed more than 3,400 complaints from March 11 to June 27—a figure that advocates say is unprecedented and concerning.\n\n\nSince March 11, OCR received 4,833 complaints and opened 309 investigations, according to the filing from Rachel Oglesby, the department’s chief of staff. OCR also started 26 of what the office calls “directed investigations,” which aren’t based on a specific complaint. Another 3,424 complaints were dismissed “consistent with OCR’s Case Processing Manual,”\n\n\n“The dismissals are high and the case-resolution numbers are low, and I understand the resolutions they count reflect work completed before the [reduction in force],” she said, adding that the 290 resolutions “reflect a shocking diminution of work output from the office.”\n\n\nOglesby didn’t provide any more information about why the complaints were dismissed or what types of violations they focused on. The department usually releases more information about OCR’s complaints and investigations as part of an annual report and in the budget process.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithheld Adult Education Funds Worry Community Colleges\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/community-colleges/2025/07/10/withheld-adult-education-funds-worry-community\n\nThe roughly $716 million was supposed to be disbursed to states July 1 and then divvied up among their adult education providers, such as community colleges. But the funding for high school equivalency classes, English as a second language programs and other adult education services never arrived.\n\n\n“Initial findings show that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,” wrote the OMB spokesperson, citing examples of states and schools using the money to support students in the country without proper documentation\n\n\n“If funding is not provided, there are nothing but bad options for institutions,” said David Baime, senior vice president for government relations for the American Association of Community Colleges. He predicts community colleges would have to reduce adult education services, lay off personnel and vie for funds to fill in the gap from states and other sources. But even so, “the funding is so substantial in a number of places that there’s no immediate source of replacing that money.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: What the Republicans’ New Policy Bill Means for Higher Education\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/us/trump-bill-education-college-student-loans.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe bill would expand the tax on endowments that universities use for financial aid, roll back student loan protections and cap the amount students can borrow for graduate programs.\n\n\nThe bill would “make college less affordable,” said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, adding that schools could become less economically and racially diverse.\n\n\nIt comes as the Trump administration has unleashed an attack on colleges and universities, cutting research grants and making it harder for international students to enroll. The administration has singled out top schools like Harvard, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania. But the bill shows that the Republican agenda for higher education extends far beyond the Ivy League.\n\n\nThe sweeping cuts to Medicaid at the center of the bill could also have ramifications for higher education. Experts say the changes, which include new work requirements, will make juggling work, education and family responsibilities even harder for low-income students.\n\n\nGetting student loans will be more difficult.\n\n\nStudent loans may depend on alumni salaries.\n\n\nUniversity endowments face higher taxes.\n\n\nPell Grants can now be used for nondegree programs. – The bipartisan move was welcomed by community colleges, which said it would make work-force training more accessible to nontraditional students.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsm.

Per the legislation, full-time UW system instructors must teach at least 24 credits across the fall and spring terms, starting September 1, 2026. That requirement is halved for the state’s two R1 universities, UW-Madison and UW-Milwaukee.\n\n\nIn addition to the 24 minimum credits during the fall and spring, instructors who are on a 12-month contract must teach six credits in the summer. Workloads for part-time instructors will be set in proportion to full-time requirements.\n\n\nBut Michael DeCesare, a senior program officer at the national American Association of University Professors, said state-mandated minimum course loads are at odds with AAUP standards, which recommend that faculty “participate fully in the determination of workload policy.”\n\n\nBudget director says NY health care will be ‘destabilized’ by federal cuts\n\nhttps://www.timesunion.com/capitol/article/dob-director-ny-health-care-destabilized-no-20765002.php\n(Thanks MB for sharing)\n\nNew York’s top budget official warned of a “destabilized” state health care system after an omnibus bill signed last week by President Donald J.

That makes it difficult to overlook the possibility that Trump’s efforts to enforce the law on college campuses are part of his calculated clench for control, higher education advocates say.\n\n\n“The DOJ has been involved in higher education before. Up until now, though, I just don’t have a sense that it’s ever been intentionally weaponized for political purposes,” said Peter McDonough, vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education. “We certainly can feel the intensity of focus and the desire for political messaging. There’s a fear factor that clearly has been a motivator and an objective.”\n\n\n“What we’re seeing here is less about enforcement of laws and more about government terrorism,” said Ferise of the Indiana law firm. “By definition terrorism is using intimidation to unlawfully pursue some kind of political gain or vendetta, and I can’t see how this is anything other than that.”\n\n\nHow a Shadowy Online Blacklist Became a Legal Threat to Pro-Palestinian Activists – Mother Jones\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/07/canary-mission-israel-palestine-blacklist-university-trump-deportation-ozturk-khalil/\n\nThe goal, Canary Mission says, is to “ensure that today’s radicals are not tomorrow’s employees” and “combat the rise in anti-Semitism on college campuses.” But lawyers, activists, and critics of the site worry that the consequences could now be more serious than diminished job prospects and that foreign students like Öztürk—who have been rounded up by the Trump administration—may have been targeted for imprisonment and deportation because they were listed on an anonymous blacklisting site. (Öztürk has since been returned to Massachusetts.)\n\n(Several CUNY community members are listed on canary)\n\nWhat’s clear, however, is that Canary Mission has been repeatedly cited in federal lawsuits against student activists and in official US government communications with universities, as the Trump administration detains students with little explanation. Canary Mission’s “about us” page claims its content meets “high standards of accuracy and authenticity,” but the spin it puts on pro-Palestinian activities is hardly objective—especially given the increasingly severe consequences for the people it describes. Attending an antiwar protest, for example, becomes “participation in a pro-Hamas rally;” criticism of Israeli policies is framed as “demonizing Israel.”\n\n\nIt “is not the first,” Lockman said, “but [it is] maybe the most effective.” Today, it holds profiles of more than 1,800 students, 1,100 professors, 300 medical professionals, and 2,100 people simply labeled “professionals.”\n\n\nIn 2018, an investigation by the Forward connected Canary Mission to a registered Israeli nonprofit called Megamot Shalom, or “Peace Trends.” Donations to Canary Mission, the outlet reported, were being routed through Megamot Shalom.\n\n\nThe Israeli nonprofit registry shows that Megamot Shalom, still active seven years after its launch, has only 11 employees. More than 99 percent of its budget—about a million dollars, for fiscal year 2023—comes via donations from abroad.\n\n\nThe Helen Diller Family Foundation listed a donation as “CANARY MISSION FOR MEGAMOT SHALOM” on its publicly accessible tax forms in 2016. (After journalists found the donations, the foundation stopped giving to either organization.) That same year, the Michael and Andrea Leven Family Foundation donated $50,000 to Megamot Shalom, and told a Jewish Currents reporter in 2021 that the money was intended for Canary Mission.\n\n\nMother Jones identified two American foundations that have donated to Canary Mission more recently: the Natan and Lidia Peisach Family Foundation, which donated $100,000 in fiscal year 2023, and the Ann and Robert Fromer Charitable Foundation, which donated $20,000 that same year.\n\n\nAs of 2016, Rabbi Ben Packer was listed as a board member of Megamot Shalom on Israel’s public charity registry. Born in the United States, Packer—who says he was a “rabbi on campus” at Duke University and the University of North Carolina—now runs an ultranationalist youth hostel in Jerusalem and lives in a West Bank settlement. He has boasted of his friendship with Stephen Miller, the Trump adviser behind many of the president’s most controversial immigration policies.\n\n\nAttempts to hold Canary Mission liable for defamation have mostly failed, in part because would-be plaintiffs cannot say conclusively whether or not it is housed in the United States. Kinza Khan, a Pakistani American Muslim woman from\n\n\nSome lawmakers, too, are treating Canary Mission as a legitimate source for triggering government investigations. Last year, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce sent letters to schools like MIT and UC Berkeley inquiring about those institutions’ responses to alleged antisemitism referenced in professors’ Canary Mission profiles.\n\n\nNow, as Republicans move to further restrict citizenship, Canary Mission is supporting a campaign by Rep. Andy Ogles to revoke New York mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani’s citizenship and deport him from this country.\n\n\nAmicus brief by AAUP, Rutgers, Middle East Studies Association\n\nhttps://www.presidentsalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PA-brief.pdf\n(Thanks KB)\n\nAmicus curiae the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration (the “Alliance”) submits this brief to advise the Court of the effects of the administration’s policy of targeting non-citizen students and faculty at institutions of higher education throughout the country based on their political views.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: How Harvard’s Ties to China Helped Make It a White House Target\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/us/harvard-china-white-house-funding.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut American foreign policy has turned sharply hawkish against China, and even though Harvard has steadily reduced its ties there, the Trump administration has made the relationship another line of attack in its broader effort to bring the university to heel. The administration has stripped away billions of dollars in federal research funding and is trying to revoke its right to host international students and also end its nonprofit tax status.\n\n\nAlan M. Garber, the university’s president, has described the administration’s overall assault on the school as a power grab “unmoored from the law, to control teaching and learning at Harvard and to dictate how it operates.”\n\n\nHarvard’s Fight Is a Defense of Democracy and Civic Virtue\n\nhttps://www.liberalcurrents.com/harvards-fight-is-a-defense-of-democracy-and-civic-virtue/\n\nTo some observers, Harvard’s stand might seem like it’s just Ivy League self‑regard, an affluent institution protecting its perks. That reading gets the stakes backward. What is under attack is the rule‑of‑law scaffolding that lets any voluntary association—PTA or synagogue, start‑up or labor union—pursue its mission without waiting for White House permission slips or fearing punitive retaliation. A university that surrenders control over whom it may admit, hire, or teach ceases to be a university; it becomes a subordinate creature of politicians and the ever-changing whims of election results.\n\n\nThe counterexample is on display in another venerable American institution of higher education, the University of Virginia, where president James Ryan proffered his resignation in the face of a targeted pressure campaign from the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, and UVA’s Board of Visitors accepted it. Under the thin pretense of enforcing civil rights laws, the federal government is now essentially dictating policies, curriculum, and personnel according to the political whims of the White House.\n\n\nIt’s not only an outrageous attack on academic freedom, it’s also an attack on the constitutional autonomy of state governments, at the public university Thomas Jefferson was once so proud of chartering he had it inscribed on his grave.\n\n\nYet history warns that trimming our sails in hopes of preserving research dollars often achieves neither independence nor solvency. Ask Central European University. When Hungary’s Viktor Orbán demanded curricular control in 2017, CEU hesitated, negotiated, and was ultimately driven from Budapest anyway. Appeasement bought time but not independence.\n\n\nThe rest of us have a part to play. Other universities can file amicus briefs. Foundations and philanthropists can step in to help keep research going while funding cutoffs are litigated. Alumni can send the signal that integrity in this moment is what keeps their checkbooks open. Ordinary citizens can refuse to sacrifice higher principles on the altar of partisan cultural grievances. Democracy’s immune system is made of these antibodies.\n\n\nTrump administration ups pressure on Harvard with threat to accreditation\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/a60c469b-6c0c-49af-9c9d-6908f4ab6561\nand\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-accreditation-subpoena-trump-00d68304\n\nThe departments of Education and Health and Human Services notified Harvard’s accreditor that a government investigation found the school violated civil-rights law for allegedly failing to protect Jewish students from antisemitic harassment.\n\n\nThe notification doesn’t remove Harvard’s accreditation—which would leave the school virtually unable to operate. Education Secretary Linda McMahon urged Harvard’s accreditor to work with the school to “keep the Department fully informed of its efforts to ensure that Harvard is in compliance with federal law and accreditor standards.”\n\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would subpoena Harvard to obtain records relevant to the enforcement of immigration laws in connection to the school’s international students.\n\nand\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/us/politics/trump-harvard-data-accreditation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe details of those offers were unclear, but Wednesday’s moves from the Trump administration suggested that the government has been dissatisfied with Harvard’s proposals.\n\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s allies view the accreditation system as a potentially powerful tool in the administration’s crusade to upend higher education. Mr. Trump has described accreditation as a “secret weapon.” In April, he signed an executive order directing federal agencies to “promptly” inform accreditors about any schools his administration determines are in violation of civil rights law.\n\n\nThe idea has circulated at the university for several years but gained steam after pro-Palestinian protests began disrupting campus in late 2023\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-conservative-scholarship-center-trump-attacks-a187242a?st=QeDVCt&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nHarvard leaders have discussed creating a program that people briefed on the talks described as a center for conservative scholarship, possibly modeled on Stanford’s Hoover Institution, as the school fights the Trump administration’s accusations that it is too liberal.\n\n\nA spokesman for Harvard said an initiative under discussion “will ensure exposure to the broadest ranges of perspectives on issues, and will not be partisan, but rather will model the use of evidence-based, rigorous logic and a willingness to engage with opposing views.” He added that the school has been accelerating efforts to set up the initiative, which would “promote and support viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\n\n\n*Columbia in Talks With Trump Administration Over Restoring Federal Funding\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-federal-funding-negotiations-deal-trump-consent-decree-88427d9a?st=J62ErS&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nRecent versions of a potential agreement between the school and the government haven’t included a consent decree, according to two of those people. A government task force had initially sought to put the university under a consent decree, which would have put a federal judge in charge of overseeing Columbia’s compliance.\n\n\nMore recent discussions, however, have involved the possibility of a monitor or outside observer who would have less power than a federal judge.\n\n\nColumbia previously agreed to an earlier set of demands from the Trump administration, including restricting masks, empowering campus police with new powers to arrest students, and appointing a senior vice provost with broad authority to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies. But those concessions only kicked off formal negotiations and didn’t restore Columbia’s federal funding.\n\n\n“Our red lines remain the same,” she said. “We must maintain our autonomy and independent governance. We decide who teaches at our institution, what they teach and which students we admit.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump wants more apprenticeships. Indiana is going all in.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/06/trump-apprenticeship-high-school-students-college-alternative/\n\nBut in the United States, the number of apprenticeships for high-schoolers is still tiny, just over one-tenth of a percent of students, according to an estimate by the think tank New America. By contrast, in Switzerland — which has been praised widely for its apprenticeship model, including by U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon — 70 percent of high-schoolers participate. Indiana is among several states, including Colorado, South Carolina and Washington, that have embraced the model and sent delegations to Switzerland to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump staffers who set out to reshape their alma maters\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/11/trump-administration-reshape-alma-mater-universities-harvard/\n\nLess than a decade ago, Gregory W. Brown helped fundraise for the University of Virginia by posing for pictures in his old dorm room.\n\n\nNow he is central to the Trump administration’s effort to crack down on his alma mater for promoting diversity, equity and inclusion programs, as one of two Justice Department leaders and U-Va. alumni to threaten sweeping funding cuts and compel the school’s president to resign.\n\n\nDriven by personal experience, the staffers are pushing to overhaul the progressive culture they feel has come to dominate elite colleges and universities.\n\n\nTogether, the staff under Trump, who prizes his degree from the University of Pennsylvania’s business school, and Vice President JD Vance, who graduated from Yale Law School, are looking to reshape academia — working to purge campuses of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and imbue the next generations of students with their worldview.\n\n\nJust last year, Wasserman was an editor on the Harvard Law Review, one of the nation’s premier legal journals, working out of an academic building in Cambridge where he was socially alienated from his more liberal classmates and frustrated with the focus on selecting diverse voices, four of his former classmates said in interviews. This year, as a policy adviser to the president, he helped launch an investigation into that publication, the New York Times first reported.\n\n\nHarmeet Dhillon, the civil rights division director at the Justice Department who also attended U-Va., shared that frustration.\n\n\nTeaching literature is an exercise in freedom. Now ideological demands from the right are putting it in danger, writes University of VIrginia English professor Mark Edmundson.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/paradise-lost-at-the-university-of-virginia-9e59195a\n\nThe members of the Jefferson Council, a conservative alumni group, have spoken much about the brainwashing and indoctrination they feel goes on in our classrooms. There may be some of that, I’ll concede, but not nearly as much as they imagine. I think that conservative students who bottle themselves up in class are more afraid of their peers’ reactions than their professors. How long before the Board of Visitors, guided by the Jefferson Council, decides it must take an active hand and begin vetting our syllabi?\n\n\nHannah Arendt, the political philosopher, suggests that a politically unanimous condition is always something to fear. When you have a sphere without tensions, without civil conflict, tyranny is in the wings. I fear that we at UVA may be on the verge of such a condition. The road that runs from the White House, to the Justice Department, to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office, to our Board of Visitors looks to be all too smooth. Who is going to stop the call for political conformity as it gathers force?\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration increases scrutiny of another Virginia university\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/10/george-mason-university-dei-probe-trump-administration/\n\nOn Thursday, the Education Department said it had opened its second civil rights investigation in two weeks into George Mason University, this one over the alleged use of race in the hiring and promotion of faculty members. The department said it had received complaints from multiple professors, including about university initiatives to make the demographics of faculty better reflect the diversity of its student body.\n\n\n“This kind of pernicious and wide-spread discrimination — packaged as ‘anti-racism’ — was allowed to flourish under the Biden Administration, but it will not be tolerated by this one,” Craig Trainor, the department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a news release.\n\n\nThis month, the Education Department notified George Mason that it had launched an investigation into the university’s alleged failure to address a hostile environment for Jewish students and faculty.\n\n\nThe stacking of investigations against George Mason follows a similar pattern that occurred in the Trump administration’s inquiries into U-Va.\n\n\nTed Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, said the probes into George Mason show the Trump administration is not interested only in “celebrity universities” like Harvard, and that institutions of higher education nationally will be watching.\n\n\nLast week, as the Education Department’s initial inquiry into George Mason became public, Washington came under fire from various conservative commentators.\n\n\nAn article in City Journal, a publication linked to the conservative think tank Manhattan Institute [Chris Rufo’s fingerprints are here], called Washington a “disastrous president” whose record “warrants his resignation or dismissal.”\n\n(also)\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/george-mason-university-antisemitism-investigation-trump\n(also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/11/george-mason-faces-2-title-vi-investigations?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed\n(also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/an-inside-job\n\n\n\n\n\nThey Want to Leave the U.S. Is a Master’s Their Ticket Out?\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/study-abroad/2025/07/07/prospective-emigrants-look-higher-education-leave-us\n\nHe doesn’t speak German. He doesn’t have ancestry in Austria. And he doesn’t need a master’s—he already has one in a different field. But as one of a growing number of Americans looking to leave the U.S. due to their disagreement with President Trump’s policies, studying abroad seemed like the path of least resistance for emigrating.\n\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, about one in five Americans said they would be interested in moving abroad if their preferred candidate did not win. Following Trump’s victory, the number of Americans searching for study abroad opportunities on the site Studyportals multiplied fivefold. CNBC reported that Google searches for “how to move to Canada” surged, especially in blue states such as Maine, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.\n\n\nWhat Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful’ Bill Means for NYC | THE CITY — NYC News\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/07/07/trump-budget-medicaid-food-stamps-local-impact/\n\nThe law punches a multi-billion dollar hole in the current state budget by reducing federal Medicaid funding, a blow that will almost certainly require Gov. Kathy Hochul to call a special legislative session in the coming months.\n\n\nThe hole gets much bigger in next year’s budget, which needs to be adopted by March 31, as the governor and legislators prepare for their reelection campaigns.\n\n\nThe immediate impact on the city will be less severe, but Mayor Eric Adams and the City Council will eventually be confronted with choices on whether to fill in some of the safety net gaps created by the GOP bill — or reduce aid to poor New Yorkers.\n\n\nUnder the Republican law, New York will lose $7.5 billion used to cover legal immigrants in the Essential Plan, which is almost entirely paid for by the federal government. The state will then have to transfer many of those people to Medicaid, which will cost an additional $2.7 billion, since federal aid for Medicaid only covers about 56% of the actual costs.\n\n\nSince the state’s fiscal year goes to the end of March, the cost in the current budget will be about $2.5 billion. But for the 2027 fiscal year, the cost will be slightly more than $10 billion.\n\n\nNew York will also immediately need to build a system to verify twice a year that Medicaid and SNAP recipients remain eligible by meeting new work requirements. The Hochul Administration estimates the cost at $500 million a year.\n\n\nThe stakes are high. A survey Public Health Solutions conducted of New Yorkers with a household income of less than $60,000 found that 71% would be unable to keep insurance, and 64% said they would be unable to maintain their doctor visits.\n\n\nNYTimes: Why 1.5 Million New Yorkers Could Lose Health Insurance Under Trump Bill\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/nyregion/trump-domestic-policy-bill-new-york-health-care.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn one key respect, the law’s impact will be felt more keenly in New York than in any other state — and it has nothing to do with Medicaid.\n\n\nInstead, it is the result of an obscure federal funding mechanism that sends billions of dollars a year to New York and nothing to most states. That money, which started flowing as a result of the Affordable Care Act, will be reduced drastically under the new law, beginning next year.\n\n\nOverall, the state could absorb a $10 billion hit annually because of the policy law. That reflects a combination of increased state expenditures and cuts in federal subsidies that support health insurance and health care for people with lower incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk’s Grok Is Calling for a New Holocaust\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/07/grok-anti-semitic-tweets/683463/\n\nThe year is 2025, and an AI model belonging to the richest man in the world has turned into a neo-Nazi.\n\n(’nuff said)\n\nCEO of Elon Musk’s X, Linda Yaccarino, resigns\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/07/09/elon-musk-linda-yaccarino-grok-x/\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

Trump has demanded that at some universities, the federal government should be allowed to influence student admissions, faculty hiring, and the content of some academic departments. The federal government has already canceled $2.6 billion in research grants to Harvard, $400 million to Columbia University, and millions more to five other universities.\n\n\nIn a talk at the Berkeley City Club last Wednesday, Lyons addressed the assault on higher education, its impacts on Cal, the balance between free speech and the right for all students to feel safe on campus, and how the UC system is approaching this era, all while it is wondering and waiting if UC will get one of those dreaded “Columbia-Harvard letters” from the administration announcing draconian cuts.\n\n\nMore cuts may be coming. Leo Terrell, senior counsel at the Department of Justice and head of its antisemitism task force, said in a Fox TV interview in May that there will be “massive lawsuits against [the] UC system. … Expect hate crime charges filed by the federal government. Expect Title VII lawsuits.”\n\n\n“Has Berkeley turned a blind eye to antisemitism?” Lyons asked in a hypothetical question to the Berkeley City Club audience. “Have we been deliberately indifferent about antisemitism on campus? No way.”\n\n\nBut executive orders aren’t law, said Catherine Lhamon, former assistant secretary for civil rights in the U.S. Department of Education, at a journalism conference in May. “Executive orders bind federal agencies about what the president directs those federal agencies to do. They don’t create law.” When asked about Trump’s antisemitism executive order, she added that schools and colleges “have an opportunity to challenge that in court, and they are not bound by the administration’s interpretation.” Llamon was recently named executive director of the Edley Center on Law & Democracy at UC Berkeley Law.\n\n\nHe [David Cole, a professor at Georgetown Law] told the committee that antisemitism only violates Title VI in narrow circumstances: When the speech is targeting an individual’s Jewish identity and when the speech is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies equal access to an education.\n\n\n“That’s a very high standard,” Cole said in the hearing. “It’s almost never been met in the case law.”\n\n\n“To be honest, and with all due respect, the hearings this committee held on this same subject last year are reminiscent not of a fair trial of any sort, but of the kind of hearings the House Committee on Un-American Activities used to hold,” Cole said in his testimony. “And I think we can all agree that the HUAC hearings were both a big mistake and a major intrusion on the First Amendment rights of Americans.”\n\n\nThe House committee wants to know if the widespread protests against Israel’s war in Gaza were authentic or were orchestrated by outside forces.",

Baylor has a duty to protect and uphold the integrity of scientific inquiry, allowing its world class faculty to investigate complex issues without fear of reprisal based on shifting political winds. Pulling the rug out from under its faculty after those researchers have already put the grueling work into securing funding, work they undertook with Baylor’s full knowledge and approval, is a chilling affront to the very concept of academic freedom. Stymying research and opportunity will inevitably lead the best and brightest students and faculty to other universities where their work and their freedom will be valued and protected.",

Here, we hope to provide some guidance for restoring campus cultures where faculty and students feel free to speak their minds and explore ideas, no matter how unpopular or controversial on or off campus they happen to be.\n\n\nThis is because universities that do not model and actively foster civic friendship become ideological seminaries, sending into the world graduates who have been trained to be zealots for particular causes rather than formed as dispassionate and determined truth-seekers.\n\n\nThey call for the principled defense of freedom of speech and the consistent enforcement of rules against speech-chilling behaviors such as harassment and the shouting-down of speakers, as well as any activities that disrupt core academic priorities such as teaching, studying and research. And they demand a commitment by university leaders to ensuring that seminar rooms and lecture halls are not “safe spaces” but rather Socratic Spaces, where students are made to wrestle with ideas that challenge their preconceived assumptions and deeply held beliefs — indeed, ideas which might make them feel uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\nNIH cancels sickle cell research grant, citing DEI, doctor says – NBC4 Washington\n\nhttps://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/nih-cuts-study-on-disease-that-affects-mostly-black-patients-citing-dei-doctor-says/3948371/\n\nA doctor says she’s scrambling to figure out how she’ll continue her work helping sickle cell disease patients after the National Institutes of Health cancelled her $750,000 research grant, citing diversity, equity and inclusion and divisiveness as a factor.\n\n\nSickle cell disease affects about 100,000 people in the U.S., and 90% of patients are Black, according to NIH.\n\n\nBut two weeks ago, the NIH told her it’s taking away her funding, citing a “low return on investment.” It also said studies involving DEI “support unlawful discrimination on the basis of race … which harms the health of Americans.”\n\n\nColleges, companies and philanthropic groups are retooling millions of dollars in scholarships that for years supported minority students\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/anti-dei-minority-scholarships-a721ba1b?st=h3S9TL&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nColleges, companies and philanthropic organizations are retooling millions of dollars in scholarships that for years supported minority students.\n\n\nUnder threat from the Trump administration and activist groups over diversity programs, some are scrapping scholarships entirely. Others are broadening the programs to focus on low-income students in general or tweaking applications to try to keep their original missions.\n\n\n“We’re seeing widespread fear of litigation prompt many scholarship providers to re-evaluate,” said Jackie Bright, president of the National Scholarship Providers Association.\n\n\nEducation experts said the changes could make it harder for minority students to graduate from college. “There’s going to be a decline in college affordability and completion rates for those students,” Bright said.\n\n\nEdward Blum [for your bingo card], whose group was behind the lawsuit that led to the 2023 Supreme Court decision that banned affirmative action, also brought the McDonald’s lawsuit.\n\n\nNYTimes: How Trump’s D.E.I.

Those who have lost grants include not only Black and Latino scientists, but also many like Mr. Dillard, who are white and from rural areas, which are solidly Trump country. The administration has decried universities as hotbeds of liberal elitism, inhospitable to viewpoint diversity. The canceled diversity grant programs were intended to make science less elite, by developing a pipeline from poorer areas of the country that tend to be more conservative.\n\n\n“I think it’s very different in their minds, who is getting the D.E.I. stuff,” Mr. Dillard said. “People on the right, they don’t realize they’re limiting the opportunity of their own kids by supporting this.”\n\n\nMany young scientists talk about feeling betrayed by the places that raised them. “I’ve encountered a lot of callousness about my fellowship being terminated,” said Ms. Reneker, at Princeton. People back home tell her “there’s going to be some casualties along the way,” or “there must be some kind of misunderstanding.”\n\n\n“These are the kids we are supposed to be propping up,” the teacher, Greg Tucker, said. “It comes back to the whole Make America Great thing again.

    "text": "A Lost Generation of Researchers\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-lost-generation-of-researchers\n\nWith that, Buan became one of thousands of early-career scholars who have become collateral damage amid policy changes at the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and other government agencies. As these agencies have sought to put caps on indirect funding, several doctoral programs paused or reduced admissions in February and March. Another wave of uncertainty hit weeks later, as the NIH and NSF terminated hundreds of existing grants, throwing many current doctoral and postdoctoral scholars’ funding into question. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year contains deep cuts to the NIH, NSF, and other federal agencies that support scientific research.\n\n\nAll told, the White House’s actions, many of which are tied up in court, could result in a lost generation of budding academics. Students are being forced to delay their graduate studies, continue them abroad, or forgo them entirely. The collective impact of those individual decisions is nearly impossible to measure, says Joanne Padrón Carney, chief governmental relations officer for the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\nhe NSF, for instance, awarded only 1,000 of its Graduate Research Fellowships this year, half of its usual total and the lowest number of awards in 15 years, according to Nature; the NIH canceled a slate of early-career programs. In a spring survey conducted by the American Institute of Physics, 37 percent of department chairs whose programs offer graduate degrees in physics and astronomy said they expected to enroll fewer graduate students in the fall of 2025 than they did last fall,\n\n\nWhat Does It Cost to Run a Lab?

The bill also sends about $10 million more to the National Weather Service and boosts funding for National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n(That is good news?)\n\nAlthough the science funding received bipartisan support, a fight over funding for the new Federal Bureau of Investigations headquarters could tank the legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: How to Wreck the Nation’s Health, by the Numbers\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/30/opinion/hhs-cuts-harming-american-health.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has terminated thousands of grants, including funding for pandemic prevention, and research grants related to cancer, vaccines and chronic diseases. The loss of research funding will delay medical discoveries. Though the agency publishes a weekly list of terminated grants, the full scope of funding cancellations has been obscured, especially at the National Institutes of Health, the major funder of medical research. A database created by Harvard researchers, Grant Watch, has helped to fill in the gaps.\n\n(See the great infographics)\n\nSince President Trump has taken office, H.H.S. has cut over $9.5 billion in grant funding that had been approved but not yet distributed to programs and researchers. [5.8B to CDC, 3.2B to NIH (2600+ grants; 578M for training grants)]\n\n\nPhysicians like me know from the data that lives will be lost as a consequence. More than 6,000 health professionals (myself included) have warned the public about their concerns in an open letter\n\nhttps://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/A-MESSAGE-OF-CONCERN-FROM-THE-NATIONS-HEALTH-PROFESSIONALS.pdf\n\nTrump’s second presidency begins: evaluating effects on the US health system - ScienceDirect\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25001838\n\nThe first hundred days of the second Trump administration was unprecedented, with the administration taking remarkably aggressive, often questionably legal actions across health policy. This article uses the Health Systems Performance Assessment Framework to identify key policies regarding resources, financing, governance, and service delivery and their impact on the cost, quality, access, and equity of the US health system. The evaluation is largely negative. The administration, in its very energetic first hundred days, has already undermined resources, financing, and in particular governance in areas as diverse as oversight of long-term care, scientific research, and vaccination policy. Administration rhetoric and budget proposals called for severe reductions in health care access and actions to terminate services for particular groups, such as immigrants or gender minorities. Many of the particular actions, such as mass layoffs of specialist scientific and regulatory staff, will be difficult to reverse.\n\n(On a grid with 64 options, 54 were colored harmful; none beneficial)\n\nShocks to specialist research communities cause rapid attrition, with scientists exiting the workforce and even the country after as little as a month of disrupted funding, and resources diverted from high-quality basic research to privately assigned, less-impactful work.17,18 They may also increase hesitancy around research participation, particularly for groups that are already under-represented in health research. One estimate suggests that the administration’s proposed NIH cuts, over 25 years, will save $500bn and cost the country $8.2 trillion in lost health-a cost more than 16 times greater than the savings, even excluding lost economic benefits from health research.\n\n\nAcross Table 1, the second Trump administration’s record is one of unprecedented damage. Budget proposals that were not enacted but started in the first hundred days would exacerbate the damage through enormous cuts to Medicaid, supplemental nutrition, HHS and NIH. Decentralizing responsibilities to the states will produce less efficiency (due to loss of economies of scale and specialist resources such as laboratories), more variation in state politics, resources, and risks, and more inequality between states.108 Trump is the least popular president in US polling history.109 It remains to be seen whether the majority of Americans will stand up and successfully demand that he change course to reflect their views.\n\n\nNIH Plans to Cap Publisher Fees, Dilute ‘Scientific Elite’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/07/10/nih-plans-cap-publisher-fees-dilute-scientific\n\nThe National Institutes of Health announced a plan Tuesday to implement a cap on the fees publishers can charge NIH-funded researchers to make their work publicly accessible.\n\n\nBoth the updated open-access policy and the NIH’s newly announced publisher fee cap, which takes effect next year, are designed to put some limits on the $19 billion for-profit scholarly publishing industry, which is dominated by a small group of for-profit megapublishers, including Elsevier, Taylor & Francis and Springer Nature. The industry thrives on the unpaid work of scholars—including thousands funded by the NIH and other federal agencies—who rely on publishing their research in prestigious journals to earn tenure, promotion and recognition as leaders in their fields.\n\n\n“I expect the response to this will be that these journals will lose some of their market power,” Bhattacharya told Charlie Kirk, founder of the right-wing group Turning Point USA, in an interview Tuesday. “A lot of their market power has to do with the fact that they bully scientists into paying large fees and essentially end up bullying us.”\n\n\nDuring the pandemic, Bhattacharya, who was a health economist at Stanford University before Trump appointed him director of the NIH, became one of the political right’s favorite examples of how the so-called scientific elite allegedly suppressed nonconformist scientific beliefs. In 2020, he criticized public officials’ recommendations for people to stay home to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus, sparking widespread backlash from other experts—including the officials running the NIH at the time.\n\n\nBut now that he’s in charge of the same agency that dismissed his views as “fringe” nearly five years ago, Bhattacharya has vowed to “establish a culture of respect for free speech in science and scientific dissent at the NIH.”\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation Department Postpones NACIQI Summer Meeting\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/08/education-department-postpones-naciqi-summer-meeting\n\nThe delay means that by the time the panel meets, the terms of six of its 18 members will have expired. The education secretary, House and Senate each appoint six members. In May, Education Secretary Linda McMahon requested nominations to fill six seats in October. Experts and members of the committee are worried that the Trump administration is trying to stack the panel in its favor as decisions about the future of higher education accreditation loom.\n\n\nThe panel, known as the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, advises the department on which independent agencies should have the power to accredit colleges and therefore which colleges should have access to federal aid. At the next meeting, NACIQI is scheduled to decide whether to renew recognition for the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the accreditor for Columbia University.\n\n\nPanel member and chair Zakiya Smith Ellis told the Journal that she is concerned that the Trump administration is “trying to take over this advisory group that is supposed to be in place for our expertise in higher education, not to push a certain political agenda.”\n\n\nFlorida Board of Governors to Vote on New Accreditor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/regional-public-universities/2025/07/11/fla-board-governors-vote-creating-new\n\nThe goal is to accredit six institutions by next summer and secure Department of Education recognition by June 2028, according to the business plan. (A new accreditor typically has two years to prove it is operating in accordance with federal regulations to receive federal approval.)\n\n\nThe Commission for Public Higher Education would be incorporated as a nonprofit organization in Florida, initially funded by a $4 million appropriation from the Florida State Legislature, according to the business plan. Other involved higher ed systems are expected to cough up similar funds. A board of directors representing each of the founding systems would oversee the new accreditor.\n\n\n“CHEA does not believe that states are likely to be effective accreditors,” she wrote. “Historically, states have not had the staff, experience, or knowledge necessary to create a higher education accreditor. It is critically important that higher education reflects an impartial and unbiased accrediting review process that is focused on student learning outcomes. To date, there has not been a state that has accomplished this.”",

OCR also started 26 of what the office calls “directed investigations,” which aren’t based on a specific complaint. Another 3,424 complaints were dismissed “consistent with OCR’s Case Processing Manual,”\n\n\n“The dismissals are high and the case-resolution numbers are low, and I understand the resolutions they count reflect work completed before the [reduction in force],” she said, adding that the 290 resolutions “reflect a shocking diminution of work output from the office.”\n\n\nOglesby didn’t provide any more information about why the complaints were dismissed or what types of violations they focused on.

But the funding for high school equivalency classes, English as a second language programs and other adult education services never arrived.\n\n\n“Initial findings show that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,” wrote the OMB spokesperson, citing examples of states and schools using the money to support students in the country without proper documentation\n\n\n“If funding is not provided, there are nothing but bad options for institutions,” said David Baime, senior vice president for government relations for the American Association of Community Colleges. He predicts community colleges would have to reduce adult education services, lay off personnel and vie for funds to fill in the gap from states and other sources. But even so, “the funding is so substantial in a number of places that there’s no immediate source of replacing that money.”",

That makes it difficult to overlook the possibility that Trump’s efforts to enforce the law on college campuses are part of his calculated clench for control, higher education advocates say.\n\n\n“The DOJ has been involved in higher education before. Up until now, though, I just don’t have a sense that it’s ever been intentionally weaponized for political purposes,” said Peter McDonough, vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education. “We certainly can feel the intensity of focus and the desire for political messaging. There’s a fear factor that clearly has been a motivator and an objective.”\n\n\n“What we’re seeing here is less about enforcement of laws and more about government terrorism,” said Ferise of the Indiana law firm. “By definition terrorism is using intimidation to unlawfully pursue some kind of political gain or vendetta, and I can’t see how this is anything other than that.”\n\n\nHow a Shadowy Online Blacklist Became a Legal Threat to Pro-Palestinian Activists – Mother Jones\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/07/canary-mission-israel-palestine-blacklist-university-trump-deportation-ozturk-khalil/\n\nThe goal, Canary Mission says, is to “ensure that today’s radicals are not tomorrow’s employees” and “combat the rise in anti-Semitism on college campuses.” But lawyers, activists, and critics of the site worry that the consequences could now be more serious than diminished job prospects and that foreign students like Öztürk—who have been rounded up by the Trump administration—may have been targeted for imprisonment and deportation because they were listed on an anonymous blacklisting site. (Öztürk has since been returned to Massachusetts.)\n\n(Several CUNY community members are listed on canary)\n\nWhat’s clear, however, is that Canary Mission has been repeatedly cited in federal lawsuits against student activists and in official US government communications with universities, as the Trump administration detains students with little explanation. Canary Mission’s “about us” page claims its content meets “high standards of accuracy and authenticity,” but the spin it puts on pro-Palestinian activities is hardly objective—especially given the increasingly severe consequences for the people it describes. Attending an antiwar protest, for example, becomes “participation in a pro-Hamas rally;” criticism of Israeli policies is framed as “demonizing Israel.”\n\n\nIt “is not the first,” Lockman said, “but [it is] maybe the most effective.” Today, it holds profiles of more than 1,800 students, 1,100 professors, 300 medical professionals, and 2,100 people simply labeled “professionals.”\n\n\nIn 2018, an investigation by the Forward connected Canary Mission to a registered Israeli nonprofit called Megamot Shalom, or “Peace Trends.” Donations to Canary Mission, the outlet reported, were being routed through Megamot Shalom.\n\n\nThe Israeli nonprofit registry shows that Megamot Shalom, still active seven years after its launch, has only 11 employees. More than 99 percent of its budget—about a million dollars, for fiscal year 2023—comes via donations from abroad.\n\n\nThe Helen Diller Family Foundation listed a donation as “CANARY MISSION FOR MEGAMOT SHALOM” on its publicly accessible tax forms in 2016. (After journalists found the donations, the foundation stopped giving to either organization.) That same year, the Michael and Andrea Leven Family Foundation donated $50,000 to Megamot Shalom, and told a Jewish Currents reporter in 2021 that the money was intended for Canary Mission.\n\n\nMother Jones identified two American foundations that have donated to Canary Mission more recently: the Natan and Lidia Peisach Family Foundation, which donated $100,000 in fiscal year 2023, and the Ann and Robert Fromer Charitable Foundation, which donated $20,000 that same year.\n\n\nAs of 2016, Rabbi Ben Packer was listed as a board member of Megamot Shalom on Israel’s public charity registry. Born in the United States, Packer—who says he was a “rabbi on campus” at Duke University and the University of North Carolina—now runs an ultranationalist youth hostel in Jerusalem and lives in a West Bank settlement. He has boasted of his friendship with Stephen Miller, the Trump adviser behind many of the president’s most controversial immigration policies.\n\n\nAttempts to hold Canary Mission liable for defamation have mostly failed, in part because would-be plaintiffs cannot say conclusively whether or not it is housed in the United States. Kinza Khan, a Pakistani American Muslim woman from\n\n\nSome lawmakers, too, are treating Canary Mission as a legitimate source for triggering government investigations. Last year, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce sent letters to schools like MIT and UC Berkeley inquiring about those institutions’ responses to alleged antisemitism referenced in professors’ Canary Mission profiles.\n\n\nNow, as Republicans move to further restrict citizenship, Canary Mission is supporting a campaign by Rep. Andy Ogles to revoke New York mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani’s citizenship and deport him from this country.\n\n\nAmicus brief by AAUP, Rutgers, Middle East Studies Association\n\nhttps://www.presidentsalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PA-brief.pdf\n(Thanks KB)\n\nAmicus curiae the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration (the “Alliance”) submits this brief to advise the Court of the effects of the administration’s policy of targeting non-citizen students and faculty at institutions of higher education throughout the country based on their political views.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: How Harvard’s Ties to China Helped Make It a White House Target\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/us/harvard-china-white-house-funding.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut American foreign policy has turned sharply hawkish against China, and even though Harvard has steadily reduced its ties there, the Trump administration has made the relationship another line of attack in its broader effort to bring the university to heel. The administration has stripped away billions of dollars in federal research funding and is trying to revoke its right to host international students and also end its nonprofit tax status.\n\n\nAlan M. Garber, the university’s president, has described the administration’s overall assault on the school as a power grab “unmoored from the law, to control teaching and learning at Harvard and to dictate how it operates.”\n\n\nHarvard’s Fight Is a Defense of Democracy and Civic Virtue\n\nhttps://www.liberalcurrents.com/harvards-fight-is-a-defense-of-democracy-and-civic-virtue/\n\nTo some observers, Harvard’s stand might seem like it’s just Ivy League self‑regard, an affluent institution protecting its perks. That reading gets the stakes backward. What is under attack is the rule‑of‑law scaffolding that lets any voluntary association—PTA or synagogue, start‑up or labor union—pursue its mission without waiting for White House permission slips or fearing punitive retaliation. A university that surrenders control over whom it may admit, hire, or teach ceases to be a university; it becomes a subordinate creature of politicians and the ever-changing whims of election results.\n\n\nThe counterexample is on display in another venerable American institution of higher education, the University of Virginia, where president James Ryan proffered his resignation in the face of a targeted pressure campaign from the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, and UVA’s Board of Visitors accepted it. Under the thin pretense of enforcing civil rights laws, the federal government is now essentially dictating policies, curriculum, and personnel according to the political whims of the White House.\n\n\nIt’s not only an outrageous attack on academic freedom, it’s also an attack on the constitutional autonomy of state governments, at the public university Thomas Jefferson was once so proud of chartering he had it inscribed on his grave.\n\n\nYet history warns that trimming our sails in hopes of preserving research dollars often achieves neither independence nor solvency. Ask Central European University. When Hungary’s Viktor Orbán demanded curricular control in 2017, CEU hesitated, negotiated, and was ultimately driven from Budapest anyway. Appeasement bought time but not independence.\n\n\nThe rest of us have a part to play. Other universities can file amicus briefs. Foundations and philanthropists can step in to help keep research going while funding cutoffs are litigated. Alumni can send the signal that integrity in this moment is what keeps their checkbooks open. Ordinary citizens can refuse to sacrifice higher principles on the altar of partisan cultural grievances. Democracy’s immune system is made of these antibodies.\n\n\nTrump administration ups pressure on Harvard with threat to accreditation\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/a60c469b-6c0c-49af-9c9d-6908f4ab6561\nand\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-accreditation-subpoena-trump-00d68304\n\nThe departments of Education and Health and Human Services notified Harvard’s accreditor that a government investigation found the school violated civil-rights law for allegedly failing to protect Jewish students from antisemitic harassment.\n\n\nThe notification doesn’t remove Harvard’s accreditation—which would leave the school virtually unable to operate. Education Secretary Linda McMahon urged Harvard’s accreditor to work with the school to “keep the Department fully informed of its efforts to ensure that Harvard is in compliance with federal law and accreditor standards.”\n\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would subpoena Harvard to obtain records relevant to the enforcement of immigration laws in connection to the school’s international students.\n\nand\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/us/politics/trump-harvard-data-accreditation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe details of those offers were unclear, but Wednesday’s moves from the Trump administration suggested that the government has been dissatisfied with Harvard’s proposals.\n\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s allies view the accreditation system as a potentially powerful tool in the administration’s crusade to upend higher education. Mr. Trump has described accreditation as a “secret weapon.” In April, he signed an executive order directing federal agencies to “promptly” inform accreditors about any schools his administration determines are in violation of civil rights law.\n\n\nThe idea has circulated at the university for several years but gained steam after pro-Palestinian protests began disrupting campus in late 2023\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-conservative-scholarship-center-trump-attacks-a187242a?st=QeDVCt&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nHarvard leaders have discussed creating a program that people briefed on the talks described as a center for conservative scholarship, possibly modeled on Stanford’s Hoover Institution, as the school fights the Trump administration’s accusations that it is too liberal.\n\n\nA spokesman for Harvard said an initiative under discussion “will ensure exposure to the broadest ranges of perspectives on issues, and will not be partisan, but rather will model the use of evidence-based, rigorous logic and a willingness to engage with opposing views.” He added that the school has been accelerating efforts to set up the initiative, which would “promote and support viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\n\n\n*Columbia in Talks With Trump Administration Over Restoring Federal Funding\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-federal-funding-negotiations-deal-trump-consent-decree-88427d9a?st=J62ErS&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nRecent versions of a potential agreement between the school and the government haven’t included a consent decree, according to two of those people. A government task force had initially sought to put the university under a consent decree, which would have put a federal judge in charge of overseeing Columbia’s compliance.\n\n\nMore recent discussions, however, have involved the possibility of a monitor or outside observer who would have less power than a federal judge.\n\n\nColumbia previously agreed to an earlier set of demands from the Trump administration, including restricting masks, empowering campus police with new powers to arrest students, and appointing a senior vice provost with broad authority to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies. But those concessions only kicked off formal negotiations and didn’t restore Columbia’s federal funding.\n\n\n“Our red lines remain the same,” she said. “We must maintain our autonomy and independent governance. We decide who teaches at our institution, what they teach and which students we admit.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump wants more apprenticeships. Indiana is going all in.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/06/trump-apprenticeship-high-school-students-college-alternative/\n\nBut in the United States, the number of apprenticeships for high-schoolers is still tiny, just over one-tenth of a percent of students, according to an estimate by the think tank New America. By contrast, in Switzerland — which has been praised widely for its apprenticeship model, including by U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon — 70 percent of high-schoolers participate. Indiana is among several states, including Colorado, South Carolina and Washington, that have embraced the model and sent delegations to Switzerland to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump staffers who set out to reshape their alma maters\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/11/trump-administration-reshape-alma-mater-universities-harvard/\n\nLess than a decade ago, Gregory W. Brown helped fundraise for the University of Virginia by posing for pictures in his old dorm room.\n\n\nNow he is central to the Trump administration’s effort to crack down on his alma mater for promoting diversity, equity and inclusion programs, as one of two Justice Department leaders and U-Va. alumni to threaten sweeping funding cuts and compel the school’s president to resign.\n\n\nDriven by personal experience, the staffers are pushing to overhaul the progressive culture they feel has come to dominate elite colleges and universities.\n\n\nTogether, the staff under Trump, who prizes his degree from the University of Pennsylvania’s business school, and Vice President JD Vance, who graduated from Yale Law School, are looking to reshape academia — working to purge campuses of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and imbue the next generations of students with their worldview.\n\n\nJust last year, Wasserman was an editor on the Harvard Law Review, one of the nation’s premier legal journals, working out of an academic building in Cambridge where he was socially alienated from his more liberal classmates and frustrated with the focus on selecting diverse voices, four of his former classmates said in interviews. This year, as a policy adviser to the president, he helped launch an investigation into that publication, the New York Times first reported.\n\n\nHarmeet Dhillon, the civil rights division director at the Justice Department who also attended U-Va., shared that frustration.\n\n\nTeaching literature is an exercise in freedom. Now ideological demands from the right are putting it in danger, writes University of VIrginia English professor Mark Edmundson.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/paradise-lost-at-the-university-of-virginia-9e59195a\n\nThe members of the Jefferson Council, a conservative alumni group, have spoken much about the brainwashing and indoctrination they feel goes on in our classrooms. There may be some of that, I’ll concede, but not nearly as much as they imagine. I think that conservative students who bottle themselves up in class are more afraid of their peers’ reactions than their professors. How long before the Board of Visitors, guided by the Jefferson Council, decides it must take an active hand and begin vetting our syllabi?\n\n\nHannah Arendt, the political philosopher, suggests that a politically unanimous condition is always something to fear. When you have a sphere without tensions, without civil conflict, tyranny is in the wings. I fear that we at UVA may be on the verge of such a condition. The road that runs from the White House, to the Justice Department, to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office, to our Board of Visitors looks to be all too smooth. Who is going to stop the call for political conformity as it gathers force?\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration increases scrutiny of another Virginia university\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/10/george-mason-university-dei-probe-trump-administration/\n\nOn Thursday, the Education Department said it had opened its second civil rights investigation in two weeks into George Mason University, this one over the alleged use of race in the hiring and promotion of faculty members. The department said it had received complaints from multiple professors, including about university initiatives to make the demographics of faculty better reflect the diversity of its student body.\n\n\n“This kind of pernicious and wide-spread discrimination — packaged as ‘anti-racism’ — was allowed to flourish under the Biden Administration, but it will not be tolerated by this one,” Craig Trainor, the department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a news release.\n\n\nThis month, the Education Department notified George Mason that it had launched an investigation into the university’s alleged failure to address a hostile environment for Jewish students and faculty.\n\n\nThe stacking of investigations against George Mason follows a similar pattern that occurred in the Trump administration’s inquiries into U-Va.\n\n\nTed Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, said the probes into George Mason show the Trump administration is not interested only in “celebrity universities” like Harvard, and that institutions of higher education nationally will be watching.\n\n\nLast week, as the Education Department’s initial inquiry into George Mason became public, Washington came under fire from various conservative commentators.\n\n\nAn article in City Journal, a publication linked to the conservative think tank Manhattan Institute [Chris Rufo’s fingerprints are here], called Washington a “disastrous president” whose record “warrants his resignation or dismissal.”\n\n(also)\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/george-mason-university-antisemitism-investigation-trump\n(also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/11/george-mason-faces-2-title-vi-investigations?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed\n(also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/an-inside-job",

He doesn’t have ancestry in Austria. And he doesn’t need a master’s—he already has one in a different field. But as one of a growing number of Americans looking to leave the U.S. due to their disagreement with President Trump’s policies, studying abroad seemed like the path of least resistance for emigrating.\n\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, about one in five Americans said they would be interested in moving abroad if their preferred candidate did not win. Following Trump’s victory, the number of Americans searching for study abroad opportunities on the site Studyportals multiplied fivefold. CNBC reported that Google searches for “how to move to Canada” surged, especially in blue states such as Maine, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.\n\n\nWhat Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful’ Bill Means for NYC | THE CITY — NYC News\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/07/07/trump-budget-medicaid-food-stamps-local-impact/\n\nThe law punches a multi-billion dollar hole in the current state budget by reducing federal Medicaid funding, a blow that will almost certainly require Gov. Kathy Hochul to call a special legislative session in the coming months.\n\n\nThe hole gets much bigger in next year’s budget, which needs to be adopted by March 31, as the governor and legislators prepare for their reelection campaigns.\n\n\nThe immediate impact on the city will be less severe, but Mayor Eric Adams and the City Council will eventually be confronted with choices on whether to fill in some of the safety net gaps created by the GOP bill — or reduce aid to poor New Yorkers.\n\n\nUnder the Republican law, New York will lose $7.5 billion used to cover legal immigrants in the Essential Plan, which is almost entirely paid for by the federal government. The state will then have to transfer many of those people to Medicaid, which will cost an additional $2.7 billion, since federal aid for Medicaid only covers about 56% of the actual costs.\n\n\nSince the state’s fiscal year goes to the end of March, the cost in the current budget will be about $2.5 billion. But for the 2027 fiscal year, the cost will be slightly more than $10 billion.\n\n\nNew York will also immediately need to build a system to verify twice a year that Medicaid and SNAP recipients remain eligible by meeting new work requirements. The Hochul Administration estimates the cost at $500 million a year.\n\n\nThe stakes are high. A survey Public Health Solutions conducted of New Yorkers with a household income of less than $60,000 found that 71% would be unable to keep insurance, and 64% said they would be unable to maintain their doctor visits.\n\n\nNYTimes: Why 1.5 Million New Yorkers Could Lose Health Insurance Under Trump Bill\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/nyregion/trump-domestic-policy-bill-new-york-health-care.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn one key respect, the law’s impact will be felt more keenly in New York than in any other state — and it has nothing to do with Medicaid.\n\n\nInstead, it is the result of an obscure federal funding mechanism that sends billions of dollars a year to New York and nothing to most states. That money, which started flowing as a result of the Affordable Care Act, will be reduced drastically under the new law, beginning next year.\n\n\nOverall, the state could absorb a $10 billion hit annually because of the policy law. That reflects a combination of increased state expenditures and cuts in federal subsidies that support health insurance and health care for people with lower incomes.",

Despite the public’s declining confidence in institutions of higher education, 76 percent of Americans think a college education is very or somewhat important for success. Ninety percent of Democrats, 71 percent of Republicans and 72 percent of Independents agree that a college education is at least somewhat important.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Republican Plot to Un-Educate America | The New Republic\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/197017/budget-bill-kill-higher-education\n\nTrump’s “big, beautiful bill” is an extinction-level event for higher education that would annihilate the country’s intellectual potential.\n\n\nFor colleges and universities, the potential fallout is hard to overstate. Whatever schools survive are likely to be drained of working- and middle-class families, instead populated only by society’s most wealthy. As it is, millions of people rightly consider universities to be a costly endeavor that is irrelevant to their everyday life. But rather than remaking higher ed into a vibrant and more democratic institution, this bill threatens to do the opposite. It will cement the stereotype of higher education as an elite institution into an ironclad reality. On June 25, student debtors and their allies will be protesting these devastating cuts in Washington, D.C. But so far, very few elected officials are sounding the alarm on these issues with the fever pitch they deserve, let alone doing the work required to slow down and obstruct their passage into law.\n\n\nIn the words of influential conservative activist Christopher Rufo, “Reforming the student loan programs could put the whole university sector into a significant recession” and state of “existential terror.” The goal is to use economic policy to impose an unpopular and stifling ideological agenda, exacted by punitive student debt.\n\n\nThese cuts won’t just harm students who rely on loans to afford college; they will take the doors off colleges’ and universities’ capacity to expand minds and redistribute opportunity. Lost revenue will encourage schools to close programs, squeeze staff, and perhaps shutter entirely. A proposed endowment tax for colleges and universities has prompted fury among higher education lobbyists, but those players have said very little about the bill’s vigorous imposition of debt as a tool of social control.\n\n\nContemporary Republicans are even more brazen. Consider a recent report released by the Heritage Foundation that recommends terminating higher education “subsidies” and student loan cancellation in order to “increase the married birthrate.” What does this goulash mean in plain English?\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Freedom Was Already Limited at U.S. Service Academies. Then Came Trump.\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/06/23/academic-freedom-service-academies-dissipates-under\n(Thanks BE for sharing)\n\nOfficials are restricting education about diversity and criticism of the U.S. It’s an erosion of rights within the institutions training America’s future military officers.\n\n\nA week into his second presidential term, Donald Trump issued an executive order banning service academies under the Defense Department—the U.S Military Academy at West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Air Force Academy—from “promoting, advancing, or otherwise inculcating the following un-American, divisive, discriminatory, radical, extremist, and irrational theories.” The theories listed were “divisive concepts,” “gender ideology,” race or sex “stereotyping” and “scapegoating,” and the idea “that America’s founding documents are racist or sexist.”\n\n\nThe Times also reported that Christopher Barth, West Point’s senior librarian, is resigning after 14 years amid demands that he identify books that might violate Hegseth’s order. West Point didn’t answer most questions that Inside Higher Ed posed to it, including whether books have actually been removed.\n\n\nAt the Naval Academy, Tom McCarthy resigned from his role as history department chair this month, The Baltimore Sun reported. The Naval Academy confirmed his resignation letter to Inside Higher Ed.\n\n\n‘A Banner Year for Censorship’: More States Are Restricting Classroom Discussions on Race and Gender\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-banner-year-for-censorship-more-states-are-restricting-classroom-discussions-on-race-and-gender\n\nTeaching social work in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Cassandra E. Simon often assigns readings that describe how the families her students might one day serve have been impacted by more than a century of housing, employment, and education discrimination. The associate professor has encouraged her students to engage in spirited discussions about race, even assigning a project in which they advocate for or against a social-justice issue.\n\n\nDoing any of those things today, she argues in a federal lawsuit, could get her fired from the state flagship, where she’s taught for 25 years. Last year, the state’s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, signed into law a sweeping bill that restricts what professors can teach about race. If any of their lessons veer into what conservative politicians have deemed “divisive concepts,” faculty members risk being reported, investigated, and potentially fired.\n\n\nBut over the past two years, more than a dozen laws have been enacted that either limit which classes can be taught or imposed restrictions on what professors can say in the classroom, according to a Chronicle analysis of state legislation and a compilation of what PEN America calls “educational gag orders.”\n\n\nThis year especially “has been a banner year for censorship at a state level across the country,” said Amy B. Reid, senior manager at PEN America’s Freedom to Learn program. “The point of a lot of these restrictions is to put people on guard, worried that anything or everything could be prohibited so you really have to watch what you say.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas looks to enact restrictions on when and how students can protest\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/20/texas-campus-speech-law-palestine-protests/\n\nSenate Bill 2972 prohibits protesting between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m., or during the last two weeks of the semester; and bans students from camping or erecting tents on campus, or wearing a disguise to conceal their identity. It also bars the use of microphones and drums.\n\n\nRepublicans in Texas say the proposal will prevent campus disruption and intimidation seen during last year’s pro-Palestinian protests. But critics across the political spectrum, such as the free speech advocacy group Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, say the proposal is too broad and threatens all forms of expressive activity.\n\n\n“Wearing a MAGA hat or a Bernie [Sanders] T-shirt would be prohibited between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. because the political apparel is an expressive act, and therefore covered as an expressive activity,” said Tyler Coward, FIRE’s lead counsel for government affairs.\n\n\nUnder the proposed law, universities could bar a guest speaker from campus if school officials believe there will be a large protest, Coward said.\n\n\nTexas Governor Signs Bill to Limit Expressive Activity on Campuses\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/free-speech/2025/06/23/texas-passes-bill-limiting-expressive-activity-campus\n\nTexas governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial bill that would restrict expressive activities on college campuses, reversing some of the rights afforded by a 2019 bill intended to protect Texans’ ability to protest on campuses.\n\n\nTexas Governor Signs Law Giving Presidents Control of Faculty Senates\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/24/texas-passes-law-presidents-control-faculty-senates\n(These were highlighted in an earlier digest, but worth repeating…)\n\nSenate Bill 37 says that only an institution’s governing board can create a faculty council or senate. If a board decides to keep one, the college or university president gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary” and prescribe how the body conducts meetings.\n\n\nUnless the institution’s board decides otherwise, faculty governing bodies must shrink to no more than 60 members. The Texas A&M University Faculty Senate currently has 122.\n\n\nThe 60 members must include at least two representatives from each of the colleges and schools that comprise the institution—including what the law describes vaguely as “one member appointed by the president or chief executive officer of the institution,” with the rest elected by the faculty of the particular school or college. This could mean that half of a faculty senate would be chosen by the president, barring an exemption by the institution’s board.\n\n\nSB 37 also says an institution’s provost can recommend to the president that members be “immediately removed” for failing to attend meetings or not conducting their “responsibilities within the council’s or senate’s parameters,” or for “similar misconduct.”\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Says He Wants to Fund More Trade Schools. Just Not These.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/21/business/job-corps-trump-trade-schools.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n“The program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve,” Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement announcing the shutdown.\n\n\nThe abrupt decision reignited a longstanding debate over the program’s merits and effectiveness. It also created a new point of contention in President Trump’s efforts to cut costs by dismantling elements of the social safety net. As Congress debates a budget bill that would reduce funding for federal anti-poverty programs such as Medicaid and food benefits, the White House is also proposing that the Job Corps, with its nearly $1.8 billion budget, be eliminated.\n\n\nTrump DEI Purge Made Black Women in Federal Jobs an “Easy Target” — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/trump-dei-black-women-minorities-careers-jobs-dismissed\n\nHer experience is part of a largely untold story unfolding as Trump dismantles civil rights and inclusion programs across government: Many of those being forced out, like Crowner, are Black women who spent decades building a career of government service, only to see those careers shattered in a sudden purge.\n\n\nNYTimes: How Trump Treats Black History Differently Than Other Parts of America’s Past\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/politics/trump-black-history-federal-holidays.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nChad Williams, a historian and professor of African American and Black diaspora studies at Boston University, said Mr. Trump’s actions, taken as a whole, showed that the administration was seeking to craft a “propaganda version of history.”\n\n\n“They’re trying to erase the history of Black struggle and Black resistance by denying the realities of racism and white supremacy,” Mr. Williams said. “They’re crafting a history that romanticizes the past at the expense of a true telling of the complexities and nuances of the American experience.”\n\n\nHBCUs Reel as Trump Cuts Black-Focused Grants: ‘This Is Our Existence’\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/hbcus-reel-as-trump-cuts-black-focused-grants-this-is-our-existence\n\nIn less than three years, Quick [Tennessee State University’s Quincy Quick] helped raise $100 million in research grants, launch an AI research center, and bring Tennessee State significantly closer to becoming the second historically Black college and university to receive Research I status. But many of those grants focused on serving Black students and Black communities, a core part of the land-grant institution’s mission.\n\n\nAs the VPs fretted over how they would retain vital research grants, one administrator quipped, “HBCUs won’t be affected because they don’t look at HBCUs as DEI.”\n\n\nQuick, the only HBCU administrator in attendance, recalled thinking, “That’s ridiculous, and it’s absolutely naïve. We absolutely would get hit. … And that’s exactly what has happened.”\n\n\nIn total, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation have canceled more than $140 million in grants at HBCUs since March, according to a Chronicle analysis of two databases tracking grant cancellations.\n\n\nThe NIH in March said that plans to enhance diversity are no longer required in training-grant applications, and “those included in applications under review will not be evaluated or considered in funding decisions.”\n\n\nThe NSF said in April that research supported by the federal government must “aim to create opportunities for all Americans everywhere.” Federally supported research on protected groups must be open to all nonprotected groups.\n\n\nThe agency has not provided guidance on what initiatives are considered DEI.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Justice Dept. Pressuring University of Virginia President to Resign\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/us/politics/university-of-virginia-president-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration has privately demanded that the University of Virginia oust its president to help resolve a Justice Department investigation into the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, according to three people briefed on the matter.\n\n\nThe extraordinary condition the Justice Department has put on the school demonstrates that President Trump’s bid to shift the ideological tilt of the higher education system, which he views as hostile to conservatives, is more far-reaching than previously understood.\n\n\nJustice Department officials have told University of Virginia officials that hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding are at risk because of what the department says is the school’s disregard for civil rights law over its diversity practices, according to two of the people.\n\n\nThe demand to remove Mr. Ryan was made over the past month on several occasions by Gregory Brown, the deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights\n\n\nHarmeet K. Dhillon, the Justice Department’s top civil rights lawyer, has also been involved in negotiations with the university.\n\n\nBefore becoming the University of Virginia’s president, Mr. Ryan served as the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he was praised for his commitment to D.E.I. programs.\n\n\nThe administration’s attempt to assert federal influence over state university leadership decisions is also illustrative of how Mr. Trump’s political appointees continue to wield the Justice Department’s investigative powers to achieve policy goals long sought by a top Trump adviser, Stephen Miller.\n\n\nBut Mr. Ryan has been singled out by the Trump administration as his steps toward compliance have been criticized by conservative groups as insufficient. America First Legal, a nonprofit started by Mr. Miller, last month accused the University of Virginia of paying lip service to Mr. Trump’s orders by simply running the same diversity programs under a different name. The group issued a news release last month that called on the Justice Department to “hold UVA accountable.”\n\n(also here)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda\n\nNYTimes: How Trump Upended 60 Years of Civil Rights in Two Months\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/27/magazine/trump-civil-rights-law-discrimination.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast year, a little-known office in the U.S. Department of Labor helped Black workers at a Texas medical center recover $900,000 in back wages, and Black workers at a Caterpillar manufacturing plant in Illinois recover $800,000, each time over allegations that those applicants lost out on jobs because of their race. Called the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, this division investigates and fights employment discrimination for one-fifth of the U.S. labor force. It was created in 1965 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an executive order strengthening the provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned racial discrimination by employers.\n\n\nOn his second day in office, President Donald Trump labeled O.F.C.C.P.’s efforts to enforce the 1964 Civil Rights Act illegal and discriminatory — presumably against white people. He signed his own executive order revoking Johnson’s on behalf of, as he put it, “hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American dream.”\n\n\nYet in the opening months of his second term, Trump has capitalized on the unpopularity of equality efforts among some Americans, glibly wielding the language of D.E.I. to initiate the broadest and most significant assault on civil rights and racial integration in this country in more than a century.\n\n\nConservatives have spent decades chipping away both at civil rights protections and the national will to address racial inequality. Since the racial reckoning of 2020, Republicans have toppled affirmative action in college admissions and waged an enormously successful campaign to make the language of equity and inclusion anathema, to label books and lessons about the nation’s history “anti-white” and “divisive” and to prohibit everything from Black studies to university diversity offices. And earlier this month, the Supreme Court, which over the years has made it increasingly challenging for Black Americans to prove discrimination, has now made it easier for straight white people to do so.\n\n\nThe Education Department sent a letter to all educational institutions receiving federal funds asserting without evidence that they were engaging in “pervasive and repugnant race-based” discrimination against white and Asian students. Federal data shows that Black students are disproportionately concentrated in schools with fewer resources and less funding, and experience significant academic disparities. And yet the letter told public schools and universities that they had 14 days to purge all diversity and equity efforts — which include programs that try to help diversify teaching staffs and help Black students close the achievement gaps they suffer from nationwide — or lose access to federal funds.\n\n\nBut probably the starkest change is the redirecting of the Department of Justice away from fighting anti-Black discrimination and toward eliminating integration efforts. Harmeet Dhillon, the new head of the department’s Civil Rights Division, sent a memo to the staff making it clear the mandate going forward would be to enforce Trump’s executive orders targeting diversity programs.\n\n(A long, well written and researched article, very much worth clicking through)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNSF Indirect Cost Cap Unlawful, Judge Rules\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/24/federal-judge-vacates-nsf-indirect-cost-cap\n\nfederal judge tossed out the National Science Foundation’s policy capping reimbursements for costs indirectly related to research, finding “severe” deficiencies in the agency’s reasoning for the plan as well as “errors of law.”\n\n\nThe ruling from Judge Indira Talwani of the District of Massachusetts is the first final judgment against the 15 percent cap, which three other federal agencies have also sought to implement. Judges have temporarily blocked those caps, but in this lawsuit, the plaintiffs sought summary judgement, which allows the judge to reach a final decision without a trial.\n\n\nThirteen universities along with the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and the American Council on Education sued the NSF in May to block the cap, arguing the policy would cut funding to institutions and risk the country’s standing “as a world leader in scientific discovery.” The government’s lawyers said in court filings that the cap would have meant a cut of $432.3 million for colleges and universities in fiscal year 2024.\n\n\nTrump Administration Ousts National Science Foundation from Headquarters Building\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administration-ousts-national-science-foundation-from-headquarters/\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development is expected to announce Wednesday that it’s moving into the headquarters of the National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia, according to the union representing NSF employees.\n\n\nThe union, Soriano wrote, “understands that there is no planning except that the HUD secretary may take over the 18th and 19th floors” and start planning the HUD move over the next two years. “There is no planning for NSF, no identified future location, appropriation for a new building or a move,” he wrote.\n\n(A bluesky post lists HUD secretaries designs to take over the 19th floor for him; build out an executive dining room, reserve 5 personal parking spaces, have exclusive use of 1 elevator, have all assistants on the 18th floor)\nAlso\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/06/25/housing-hud-relocation/\n\nThe move will displace about 1,800 employees at the National Science Foundation, which has faced massive spending cuts under the Trump administration. Administration officials on Wednesday did not say where those NSF workers would end up, but Peters said the search for a new location would aim to minimize disruption to those employees’ lives and work.\n\n\nThe frustration added to broader discontent at HUD, the backbone of the federal government’s housing policy. Since Trump’s inauguration, the department has sought to slash funding for fair housing efforts, rental assistance, housing vouchers and homelessness prevention. So many staffers took the second-round buyout offer that officials are trying to get people to voluntarily move into vacant roles.\n\n\n“This callous disregard for taxpayer dollars and NSF employees comes after the Administration already cut NSF’s budget, staff and science grants and forced NSF employees back into the office,” the union said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump admin curtails colleges’ defense research\n\n[Politico Weekly Education email]\n\nFUNDING CUTS: The Department of Defense is shrinking research funding at various colleges and universities, a move that academics say curtails projects that keep U.S. troops safe.\n\n\nEarlier this month, the administration notified universities it would cut facility and administrative reimbursements to 15 percent for all DOD research grants focused on protecting military service members and strengthening national defense. These rates are negotiated between individual institutions and the government, but often fall between 50 percent and 65 percent.\n\n\nSeparate from the lawsuit, Cornell received 75 stop-work orders from DOD, which affected research pertaining to national defense, cybersecurity, and health.\n\nhttps://statements.cornell.edu/2025/20250408-federal-research-funding.cfm\n\n\n\n\nThe Education Department is paying us millions not to work\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/23/education-department-layoffs-doge-afge/\n\nNearly two million student loan borrowers are at risk of having their wages garnished this summer\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/student-loan-wage-garnishment-07fc4d2a?st=wKEnzN&reflink=article_gmail_share\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/financial-aid/2025/06/24/federal-cuts-could-lead-reduced-financial-aid-offers\n\n\n\n\n\nCongress Eyes Cap on Parent PLUS Loans\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/financial-aid/2025/06/25/advocates-say-parent-plus-caps-will-reduce-college-access\n\nBoth House and Senate Republicans want to cap how much parents can borrow via the Parent PLUS loan program, though they disagree about the amount. The House plan limits parents to $50,000 total, while the Senate plan would allow them to borrow up to $65,000 per dependent. Currently, the loans are uncapped, so parents can borrow as much as they need.\n\n\n(Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said at a recent hearing that about 34 percent of those with Parent PLUS loans borrow above the House’s proposed cap of $50,000.)\n\n\nThe proposed caps are just one of many cuts to student aid that Congress has included in recent proposals as part of the process known as reconciliation. The House version of the bill, which includes steeper cuts and restrictions across the board, passed in late May, while the Senate continues to finalize its proposal and is planning to vote on it as soon as this week. President Donald Trump has said he wants to sign what he’s dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by July 4.\n\n\nBut college-accessibility advocates have warned that the legislation will inevitably make college less affordable and loans more difficult to pay off for millions of Americans.\n\n\nTransUnion: 5M Borrowers Could Default by September\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/25/transunion-5m-borrowers-could-default-september\n\nThe TransUnion analysis found that as of April 2025, nearly one-third of borrowers were more than 90 days past due on their loans—a roughly 10-percentage-point jump compared to February 2025. Before the government paused payments in spring 2020 because of the pandemic, just 11.7 percent of borrowers fell into this category.\n\n\nBorrowers default when they are 270 days behind on their payments. TransUnion expects about 1.8 million borrowers to default in July, followed by another million in August and then another two million in September.\n\n\nThe Education Department resumed debt collections in May—the first time in more than three years that borrowers who defaulted on their loans faced the harshest consequences. Since that announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and other officials have worked to spread the word about the consequences of default and defended the restart as necessary to shore up the student loan system. They’ve encouraged borrowers to get in touch with their student loan servicer and urged colleges to get involved as well.\n\n\nThe Trump administration did plan to withhold some federal benefits such as tax returns and Social Security checks, but officials later backed off that part of that plan.\n\n\nBut so far, the department has held off on restarting its automatic wage garnishment system, in which they can dock up to 15 percent of a defaulted borrower’s paycheck. The agency plans to resume that system this summer.\n\n\nGraduate Programs Face a Federal Reckoning\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/graduate/2025/06/26/can-graduate-programs-survive-federal-loan-caps\n\nCongress wants to significantly cut back on federal loans for grad students. That could decimate the highly profitable graduate degree market—and limit who has access to it.\n\n\nThe Senate version of the reconciliation bill, which President Donald Trump has urged Congress to pass as early as next week, would cap professional degree loans at $200,000 and all other graduate loans at $100,000. Both the House and the Senate also proposed completely eliminating Grad PLUS, an unsubsidized federal loan with no borrowing limit that has helped students from modest backgrounds pay for graduate degrees since 2006.\n\n(This doesn’t seem to have an impact on CUNY students)\n\nEducation Department Outlines Plan to Change Debt-Relief Program for Public Servants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/06/26/education-department-outlines-plan-change-pslf-rules\n(This is a bit misplaced, but this would impact CUNY students)\n\nCritics worry that the changes could derail debt relief for borrowers and allow the administration to block funds from reaching public servants who work in fields or for employers that the president disagrees with.\n\n\n“The law does not empower the Secretary of Education to opine on the supposed illegality of a public service employer’s mission—an unprecedented exercise of executive power that extends far beyond the Higher Education Act,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, which shared a copy of the issue paper with Inside Higher Ed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard and Trump Restart Talks to Potentially End Bitter Dispute\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/politics/harvard-federal-funding-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIt is unclear how close both sides are to a potential deal and the exact terms any final agreement would entail. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said it was “very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so.”\n\n\nHarvard has been widely praised by Democrats, academics, its alumni and democracy advocates for fighting the Trump administration. But top Harvard officials, according to two people briefed on the matter, have become increasingly convinced in recent weeks that the school has little choice but to try to strike a deal with the White House.\n\n\nThe Harvard officials believe that if the university remains at odds with the administration that it is likely to become far smaller and less ambitious as Mr. Trump tries to keep pummeling it with funding cuts, federal investigations and limits on visas for international students.\n\n\nIn exchange, Harvard would agree to take even more aggressive action than it already has to address issues such as antisemitism, race, and viewpoint diversity. The White House has pushed Harvard to make new commitments to change its admissions and hiring practices, one of the people close to the negotiations said.\n\n\nThe White House, according to one person briefed on the negotiations, hopes that an agreement with Harvard might serve as a framework for other elite colleges to strike deals with Mr. Trump. Other schools have been in discussions with the Trump administration about making deals that would keep their federal funding intact and avoid the president’s ire, two of the people said.\n\n\nAmong other conditions, the administration wanted Harvard to establish “merit based” hiring and admissions policies, and to see the influence of its faculty curbed. It sought a review for “viewpoint diversity,” the shutdown of any programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, and an outside review to examine “those programs and departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.”\n\n\nThe government also asked for Harvard to adjust its “recruitment, screening and admissions of international students,” audits of university data and reports “at least until the end of 2028” about the university’s compliance with the Trump administration’s conditions.\n\n\nUntil recently, though, Harvard’s top board resisted talks. The members directed the school’s battalion of lawyers, many of them fixtures of conservative legal circles, not to engage with the government.\n\n\nThe calculus has since shifted, in parallel with a handful of courtroom successes for Harvard and Mr. Trump’s public venting that the university had drawn a favorable judge.\n\n(Anyways, if Harvard bends it will be a gigantic blow to higher education. This article tries to narrow the “deal” to it impacting other top colleges, but this just opens the gates to asking for more and more and more, as the same threats can be reapplied by an administration that doesn’t honor past “deals”.)\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Live Updates: Federal Judge Blocks Efforts to Keep International Students Out of Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/20/us/trump-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nHarvard dispute: A federal judge on Friday froze the Trump administration’s effort to stop international students from enrolling at Harvard University.

It does not address President Donald Trump’s executive proclamation from earlier this month banning the State Department from issuing visas to international students and researchers attending Harvard; a temporary restriction on that ban expired June 20.\n\n\nNYTimes: ‘Are We Past Peak Harvard?’: 3 Writers Mull Higher Education’s Woes\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/opinion/trump-higher-education-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLarry Summers: Maybe, but there are countervailing forces. Harvard’s relative prestige rises with the square of the distance from Cambridge, and so a global talent competition helps it. The greatest universities are drivers of progress. The 21st century will be a center of the life sciences, and because of Harvard, M.I.T. and their affiliates, Boston and Cambridge are ground zero, creating a flywheel effect with Stanford and digital technology. If anything, the trend is toward a higher fraction of government, business, artistic elites coming from elite schools as they get better at drawing talent.\n\n\nSummers: The trend could break if Trump stays super-destructive, courts are super-tolerant and the universities don’t adapt and settle. That is a real worry. My best guess, though, is that the need for universities as economic engines, the enforcement of law and the fact that there is low-hanging fruit for cultural correction in the universities will carry the day. I don’t think there is yet evidence of leading universities losing their appeal. Yes, there is a need to walk back from crazy, as there was after the 1960s. My guess is this will happen. You will see versions of Stanford’s Hoover Institution on many campuses, more emphasis on nonideological science and a big walk back on identity politics.\n\n\nBruni: Ross, it’s clear that Trump and his allies actually don’t want sweeping protections for free speech. They correctly called out intolerance on the left but are now replacing it with intolerance from the right. When you’re essentially banning any mention of D.E.I., detaining students for political viewpoints they’ve articulated, putting institutions on notice that you’ll punish them for any deviation from just-two-genders orthodoxy, well, Trump is swapping one cancel culture for another. No?\n\n(But there is no convincing Ross Douthat and Larry Summers carries around grudges about faculty for who knows when)\n\nNYTimes: Here Is All the Science at Risk in Trump’s Clash With Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/22/upshot/harvard-funding-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe federal government annually spends billions funding research at Harvard, part of a decades-old system that is little understood by the public but essential to American science.\n\n\nThis spring, nearly every dollar of that payment was cut off by the Trump administration, endangering much of the university’s research.\n\n\nThe New York Times was able to identify more than 900 terminated grants, using court records, government databases and other internal university sources — a near-complete accounting of the cuts in the Trump administration’s escalating campaign to cripple the university.\n\n(Accompanying infographic is top notch)\n\nHarvard flouted the rules.

Bollinger, a former president of Columbia University and the University of Michigan, said that Harvard stood at a critical juncture in the history of American academia.\n\n\n“How you conduct yourself in these moments will say a lot over the future,” he said.\n\n\nHe warned that allowing the government a say in hiring was a perilous threat to “a core, core academic freedom principle.”\n\n\nMany around academia are wary of the White House’s record. …\n\n\nWith stakes high, White House pushes negotiations with Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/24/with-stakes-high-white-house-pushes-negotiations-with-harvard/\n\nThe Trump administration is ramping up negotiations with Harvard University in an effort to reach an end to its months-long battle with the elite school, two senior White House officials have said, as Harvard has been racking up legal wins in court.\n\n\nThe administration expects a deal to land by the end of the month, one official said, and hopes the agreement would make a big enough splash to “basically be a blueprint for the rest of higher education.” The White House officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\n\nHarvard declined to comment.\n\n\nHarvard allies, free-speech advocates and others have feared that the Trump administration would use its attacks on Harvard to exert control over universities nationwide and dismantle academic freedom. Whatever the outcome, the case will create a significant precedent, said higher education attorney Sarah Hartley.\n\n\n“This is the playbook to be used with other universities by the government going forward,” said Hartley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm BCLP. “It, in many ways, is being used as a test of democracy and what the government can force on private institutions.”\n\n\nThe government may have more motivation to come to a settlement outside of court than Harvard does, said higher education attorney Jodie Ferise, who believes Harvard has a stronger legal case.\n\n\n“The White House has every incentive to want to reach some kind of compromise, because I don’t think they’ll win this case,” she said.\n\n\n“The government cannot attempt a hostile takeover of any private institution, much less a private college or university, in order to impose its preferred vision of ideological balance,” the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in a brief filed with seven other organizations, including the right-leaning Cato Institute and Rutherford Institute.\n\n\nHarvard scientist accused of smuggling frog embryos faces new charges\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/26/harvard-researcher-frog-embryos-ice/\n\nIf convicted on the felony smuggling charge, Petrova could face up to 20 years in prison and be fined as much as $250,000.

One of the laws requires public colleges and universities to eliminate programs with low numbers of degrees averaged over a three-year period. The cutoff is 15 graduates for a bachelor’s degree, seven for a master’s and three for a doctorate.\n\n\nSo far, most faculty don’t know what to expect. President-elect of the Bloomington Faculty Council Heather Akou said she hasn’t heard anything from the university but that it’s “aggressively” moving to get in line with the law. “There are going to be big changes for this university, and the pace at which this is being pushed through is not designed for positive outcomes,” she said. “I have to say that my faculty colleagues are in panic to a degree that I have never seen before.”\n\n\nMost of the degrees with low numbers of recipients are in the humanities and languages. Jewish Studies, Classical Studies and multiple language departments could lose their main offerings. From 2020 to 2022, IU Bloomington conferred more humanities doctorates than any other university in the country, according to data from Carnegie Classifications. It also ranks first for number of languages taught, for now.\n\n\n“Even tenured faculty are wondering, am I going to have a job in two months?” Akou said. “We’re scheduled to teach classes. Will I be allowed to teach the classes I’m scheduled to teach this fall? I don’t know. That’s really the level of chaos and confusion that’s going on right now.” The university declined an interview, but spokesperson Mark Bode wrote in an email that “IU is working with campus leaders to comply with the process mandated by state law.”\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Dept. says it is investigating Univ. of California hiring practices\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/26/university-california-trump-dei-investigation-hiring-justice/\n\nIn a letter to University of California President Michael Drake dated Thursday, the Justice Department claimed a strategic growth plan created by the UC system that mentions diversity in hiring suggests that the educational institution “may be engaged” in discriminatory employment practices based on race or sex.\n\n(May be the only people who take a strategic plan so seriously; ours is here https://www.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/about/chancellor/strategic-roadmap/CUNY_Lifting_New_York.pdf )\n\nThe antisemitism probe at the UC system is supposed to determine whether a “hostile work environment” has existed for Jewish employees on its campuses. The investigation announced Monday, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, will similarly seek to determine whether discrimination has existed in UC hiring.\n\n\n“It is important to note that we have not reached any conclusions about the subject matter of the investigation. We intend to consider all relevant information,” Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said in her letter to Drake.\n\n\nDhillon’s letter did not detail specific allegations of instances of hiring discrimination. She cited the University of California 2030 Capacity Plan as having “precipitated unlawful action,” specifically employment practices that may have discriminated against “employees, job applicants and training program participants based on race and sex.”\n\n\nIn its strategic plan, the University of California says it is “committed to increasing the diversity of its faculty, both underrepresented minorities and female faculty.” The plan discusses efforts to diversify the faculty so that campuses better reflect the population of California, a goal partially rooted in helping populations who are less likely to graduate from college earn degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Budget Cuts and a Loss of Trust Threaten Higher Ed’s Workforce\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/career-development/2025/06/23/budget-cuts-loss-trust-threaten-higher-eds\n\nThe consequences of the sector’s financial instability and ongoing government attacks include anxiety among faculty and staff feeling the strain of hiring freezes, uncertainty about internal grant opportunities and even questions about having enough staff on hand to continue delivering basic services, said Kevin McClure, a professor of higher education and chair of the Department of Educational Leadership at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.\n\n\nHe added that leaders who have compromised their institutional values in response to political pressure have eroded the trust of their campus communities.\n\n\nFIU Donor Pulls Funds Over President’s Politics\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/26/fiu-donor-pulls-funds-over-presidents-politics\n\nA Miami businessman has walked back a $1 million donation to Florida International University after lawmakers repealed in-state tuition for undocumented students, The Miami Herald reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nNSF Grant Terminations 2025\n\nhttps://grant-watch.us/\n\nGrant Watch is a project to track the termination of grants of scientific research agencies under the Trump administration in 2025.

    "text": "The Republican Plot to Un-Educate America | The New Republic\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/197017/budget-bill-kill-higher-education\n\nTrump’s “big, beautiful bill” is an extinction-level event for higher education that would annihilate the country’s intellectual potential.\n\n\nFor colleges and universities, the potential fallout is hard to overstate. Whatever schools survive are likely to be drained of working- and middle-class families, instead populated only by society’s most wealthy. As it is, millions of people rightly consider universities to be a costly endeavor that is irrelevant to their everyday life. But rather than remaking higher ed into a vibrant and more democratic institution, this bill threatens to do the opposite. It will cement the stereotype of higher education as an elite institution into an ironclad reality. On June 25, student debtors and their allies will be protesting these devastating cuts in Washington, D.C. But so far, very few elected officials are sounding the alarm on these issues with the fever pitch they deserve, let alone doing the work required to slow down and obstruct their passage into law.\n\n\nIn the words of influential conservative activist Christopher Rufo, “Reforming the student loan programs could put the whole university sector into a significant recession” and state of “existential terror.” The goal is to use economic policy to impose an unpopular and stifling ideological agenda, exacted by punitive student debt.\n\n\nThese cuts won’t just harm students who rely on loans to afford college; they will take the doors off colleges’ and universities’ capacity to expand minds and redistribute opportunity. Lost revenue will encourage schools to close programs, squeeze staff, and perhaps shutter entirely. A proposed endowment tax for colleges and universities has prompted fury among higher education lobbyists, but those players have said very little about the bill’s vigorous imposition of debt as a tool of social control.\n\n\nContemporary Republicans are even more brazen. Consider a recent report released by the Heritage Foundation that recommends terminating higher education “subsidies” and student loan cancellation in order to “increase the married birthrate.” What does this goulash mean in plain English?",

Then Came Trump.\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/06/23/academic-freedom-service-academies-dissipates-under\n(Thanks BE for sharing)\n\nOfficials are restricting education about diversity and criticism of the U.S. It’s an erosion of rights within the institutions training America’s future military officers.\n\n\nA week into his second presidential term, Donald Trump issued an executive order banning service academies under the Defense Department—the U.S Military Academy at West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Air Force Academy—from “promoting, advancing, or otherwise inculcating the following un-American, divisive, discriminatory, radical, extremist, and irrational theories.” The theories listed were “divisive concepts,” “gender ideology,” race or sex “stereotyping” and “scapegoating,” and the idea “that America’s founding documents are racist or sexist.”\n\n\nThe Times also reported that Christopher Barth, West Point’s senior librarian, is resigning after 14 years amid demands that he identify books that might violate Hegseth’s order. West Point didn’t answer most questions that Inside Higher Ed posed to it, including whether books have actually been removed.\n\n\nAt the Naval Academy, Tom McCarthy resigned from his role as history department chair this month, The Baltimore Sun reported. The Naval Academy confirmed his resignation letter to Inside Higher Ed.\n\n\n‘A Banner Year for Censorship’: More States Are Restricting Classroom Discussions on Race and Gender\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-banner-year-for-censorship-more-states-are-restricting-classroom-discussions-on-race-and-gender\n\nTeaching social work in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Cassandra E. Simon often assigns readings that describe how the families her students might one day serve have been impacted by more than a century of housing, employment, and education discrimination. The associate professor has encouraged her students to engage in spirited discussions about race, even assigning a project in which they advocate for or against a social-justice issue.\n\n\nDoing any of those things today, she argues in a federal lawsuit, could get her fired from the state flagship, where she’s taught for 25 years. Last year, the state’s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, signed into law a sweeping bill that restricts what professors can teach about race. If any of their lessons veer into what conservative politicians have deemed “divisive concepts,” faculty members risk being reported, investigated, and potentially fired.\n\n\nBut over the past two years, more than a dozen laws have been enacted that either limit which classes can be taught or imposed restrictions on what professors can say in the classroom, according to a Chronicle analysis of state legislation and a compilation of what PEN America calls “educational gag orders.”\n\n\nThis year especially “has been a banner year for censorship at a state level across the country,” said Amy B. Reid, senior manager at PEN America’s Freedom to Learn program. “The point of a lot of these restrictions is to put people on guard, worried that anything or everything could be prohibited so you really have to watch what you say.”",

    "text": "Texas looks to enact restrictions on when and how students can protest\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/20/texas-campus-speech-law-palestine-protests/\n\nSenate Bill 2972 prohibits protesting between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m., or during the last two weeks of the semester; and bans students from camping or erecting tents on campus, or wearing a disguise to conceal their identity. It also bars the use of microphones and drums.\n\n\nRepublicans in Texas say the proposal will prevent campus disruption and intimidation seen during last year’s pro-Palestinian protests. But critics across the political spectrum, such as the free speech advocacy group Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, say the proposal is too broad and threatens all forms of expressive activity.\n\n\n“Wearing a MAGA hat or a Bernie [Sanders] T-shirt would be prohibited between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. because the political apparel is an expressive act, and therefore covered as an expressive activity,” said Tyler Coward, FIRE’s lead counsel for government affairs.\n\n\nUnder the proposed law, universities could bar a guest speaker from campus if school officials believe there will be a large protest, Coward said.\n\n\nTexas Governor Signs Bill to Limit Expressive Activity on Campuses\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/free-speech/2025/06/23/texas-passes-bill-limiting-expressive-activity-campus\n\nTexas governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial bill that would restrict expressive activities on college campuses, reversing some of the rights afforded by a 2019 bill intended to protect Texans’ ability to protest on campuses.\n\n\nTexas Governor Signs Law Giving Presidents Control of Faculty Senates\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/24/texas-passes-law-presidents-control-faculty-senates\n(These were highlighted in an earlier digest, but worth repeating…)\n\nSenate Bill 37 says that only an institution’s governing board can create a faculty council or senate. If a board decides to keep one, the college or university president gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary” and prescribe how the body conducts meetings.\n\n\nUnless the institution’s board decides otherwise, faculty governing bodies must shrink to no more than 60 members. The Texas A&M University Faculty Senate currently has 122.\n\n\nThe 60 members must include at least two representatives from each of the colleges and schools that comprise the institution—including what the law describes vaguely as “one member appointed by the president or chief executive officer of the institution,” with the rest elected by the faculty of the particular school or college. This could mean that half of a faculty senate would be chosen by the president, barring an exemption by the institution’s board.\n\n\nSB 37 also says an institution’s provost can recommend to the president that members be “immediately removed” for failing to attend meetings or not conducting their “responsibilities within the council’s or senate’s parameters,” or for “similar misconduct.”\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Says He Wants to Fund More Trade Schools.

It also created a new point of contention in President Trump’s efforts to cut costs by dismantling elements of the social safety net. As Congress debates a budget bill that would reduce funding for federal anti-poverty programs such as Medicaid and food benefits, the White House is also proposing that the Job Corps, with its nearly $1.8 billion budget, be eliminated.\n\n\nTrump DEI Purge Made Black Women in Federal Jobs an “Easy Target” — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/trump-dei-black-women-minorities-careers-jobs-dismissed\n\nHer experience is part of a largely untold story unfolding as Trump dismantles civil rights and inclusion programs across government: Many of those being forced out, like Crowner, are Black women who spent decades building a career of government service, only to see those careers shattered in a sudden purge.\n\n\nNYTimes: How Trump Treats Black History Differently Than Other Parts of America’s Past\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/politics/trump-black-history-federal-holidays.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nChad Williams, a historian and professor of African American and Black diaspora studies at Boston University, said Mr. Trump’s actions, taken as a whole, showed that the administration was seeking to craft a “propaganda version of history.”\n\n\n“They’re trying to erase the history of Black struggle and Black resistance by denying the realities of racism and white supremacy,” Mr. Williams said. “They’re crafting a history that romanticizes the past at the expense of a true telling of the complexities and nuances of the American experience.”\n\n\nHBCUs Reel as Trump Cuts Black-Focused Grants: ‘This Is Our Existence’\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/hbcus-reel-as-trump-cuts-black-focused-grants-this-is-our-existence\n\nIn less than three years, Quick [Tennessee State University’s Quincy Quick] helped raise $100 million in research grants, launch an AI research center, and bring Tennessee State significantly closer to becoming the second historically Black college and university to receive Research I status. But many of those grants focused on serving Black students and Black communities, a core part of the land-grant institution’s mission.\n\n\nAs the VPs fretted over how they would retain vital research grants, one administrator quipped, “HBCUs won’t be affected because they don’t look at HBCUs as DEI.”\n\n\nQuick, the only HBCU administrator in attendance, recalled thinking, “That’s ridiculous, and it’s absolutely naïve. We absolutely would get hit. … And that’s exactly what has happened.”\n\n\nIn total, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation have canceled more than $140 million in grants at HBCUs since March, according to a Chronicle analysis of two databases tracking grant cancellations.\n\n\nThe NIH in March said that plans to enhance diversity are no longer required in training-grant applications, and “those included in applications under review will not be evaluated or considered in funding decisions.”\n\n\nThe NSF said in April that research supported by the federal government must “aim to create opportunities for all Americans everywhere.” Federally supported research on protected groups must be open to all nonprotected groups.\n\n\nThe agency has not provided guidance on what initiatives are considered DEI.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Justice Dept.

Dhillon, the Justice Department’s top civil rights lawyer, has also been involved in negotiations with the university.\n\n\nBefore becoming the University of Virginia’s president, Mr. Ryan served as the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he was praised for his commitment to D.E.I. programs.\n\n\nThe administration’s attempt to assert federal influence over state university leadership decisions is also illustrative of how Mr. Trump’s political appointees continue to wield the Justice Department’s investigative powers to achieve policy goals long sought by a top Trump adviser, Stephen Miller.\n\n\nBut Mr. Ryan has been singled out by the Trump administration as his steps toward compliance have been criticized by conservative groups as insufficient. America First Legal, a nonprofit started by Mr. Miller, last month accused the University of Virginia of paying lip service to Mr. Trump’s orders by simply running the same diversity programs under a different name. The group issued a news release last month that called on the Justice Department to “hold UVA accountable.”\n\n(also here)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda\n\nNYTimes: How Trump Upended 60 Years of Civil Rights in Two Months\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/27/magazine/trump-civil-rights-law-discrimination.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast year, a little-known office in the U.S. Department of Labor helped Black workers at a Texas medical center recover $900,000 in back wages, and Black workers at a Caterpillar manufacturing plant in Illinois recover $800,000, each time over allegations that those applicants lost out on jobs because of their race. Called the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, this division investigates and fights employment discrimination for one-fifth of the U.S. labor force. It was created in 1965 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an executive order strengthening the provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned racial discrimination by employers.\n\n\nOn his second day in office, President Donald Trump labeled O.F.C.C.P.’s efforts to enforce the 1964 Civil Rights Act illegal and discriminatory — presumably against white people. He signed his own executive order revoking Johnson’s on behalf of, as he put it, “hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American dream.”\n\n\nYet in the opening months of his second term, Trump has capitalized on the unpopularity of equality efforts among some Americans, glibly wielding the language of D.E.I. to initiate the broadest and most significant assault on civil rights and racial integration in this country in more than a century.\n\n\nConservatives have spent decades chipping away both at civil rights protections and the national will to address racial inequality. Since the racial reckoning of 2020, Republicans have toppled affirmative action in college admissions and waged an enormously successful campaign to make the language of equity and inclusion anathema, to label books and lessons about the nation’s history “anti-white” and “divisive” and to prohibit everything from Black studies to university diversity offices. And earlier this month, the Supreme Court, which over the years has made it increasingly challenging for Black Americans to prove discrimination, has now made it easier for straight white people to do so.\n\n\nThe Education Department sent a letter to all educational institutions receiving federal funds asserting without evidence that they were engaging in “pervasive and repugnant race-based” discrimination against white and Asian students. Federal data shows that Black students are disproportionately concentrated in schools with fewer resources and less funding, and experience significant academic disparities. And yet the letter told public schools and universities that they had 14 days to purge all diversity and equity efforts — which include programs that try to help diversify teaching staffs and help Black students close the achievement gaps they suffer from nationwide — or lose access to federal funds.\n\n\nBut probably the starkest change is the redirecting of the Department of Justice away from fighting anti-Black discrimination and toward eliminating integration efforts. Harmeet Dhillon, the new head of the department’s Civil Rights Division, sent a memo to the staff making it clear the mandate going forward would be to enforce Trump’s executive orders targeting diversity programs.\n\n(A long, well written and researched article, very much worth clicking through)",

Judges have temporarily blocked those caps, but in this lawsuit, the plaintiffs sought summary judgement, which allows the judge to reach a final decision without a trial.\n\n\nThirteen universities along with the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and the American Council on Education sued the NSF in May to block the cap, arguing the policy would cut funding to institutions and risk the country’s standing “as a world leader in scientific discovery.” The government’s lawyers said in court filings that the cap would have meant a cut of $432.3 million for colleges and universities in fiscal year 2024.\n\n\nTrump Administration Ousts National Science Foundation from Headquarters Building\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administration-ousts-national-science-foundation-from-headquarters/\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development is expected to announce Wednesday that it’s moving into the headquarters of the National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia, according to the union representing NSF employees.\n\n\nThe union, Soriano wrote, “understands that there is no planning except that the HUD secretary may take over the 18th and 19th floors” and start planning the HUD move over the next two years. “There is no planning for NSF, no identified future location, appropriation for a new building or a move,” he wrote.\n\n(A bluesky post lists HUD secretaries designs to take over the 19th floor for him; build out an executive dining room, reserve 5 personal parking spaces, have exclusive use of 1 elevator, have all assistants on the 18th floor)\nAlso\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/06/25/housing-hud-relocation/\n\nThe move will displace about 1,800 employees at the National Science Foundation, which has faced massive spending cuts under the Trump administration. Administration officials on Wednesday did not say where those NSF workers would end up, but Peters said the search for a new location would aim to minimize disruption to those employees’ lives and work.\n\n\nThe frustration added to broader discontent at HUD, the backbone of the federal government’s housing policy. Since Trump’s inauguration, the department has sought to slash funding for fair housing efforts, rental assistance, housing vouchers and homelessness prevention. So many staffers took the second-round buyout offer that officials are trying to get people to voluntarily move into vacant roles.\n\n\n“This callous disregard for taxpayer dollars and NSF employees comes after the Administration already cut NSF’s budget, staff and science grants and forced NSF employees back into the office,” the union said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump admin curtails colleges’ defense research\n\n[Politico Weekly Education email]\n\nFUNDING CUTS: The Department of Defense is shrinking research funding at various colleges and universities, a move that academics say curtails projects that keep U.S. troops safe.\n\n\nEarlier this month, the administration notified universities it would cut facility and administrative reimbursements to 15 percent for all DOD research grants focused on protecting military service members and strengthening national defense.

The House plan limits parents to $50,000 total, while the Senate plan would allow them to borrow up to $65,000 per dependent. Currently, the loans are uncapped, so parents can borrow as much as they need.\n\n\n(Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said at a recent hearing that about 34 percent of those with Parent PLUS loans borrow above the House’s proposed cap of $50,000.)\n\n\nThe proposed caps are just one of many cuts to student aid that Congress has included in recent proposals as part of the process known as reconciliation. The House version of the bill, which includes steeper cuts and restrictions across the board, passed in late May, while the Senate continues to finalize its proposal and is planning to vote on it as soon as this week. President Donald Trump has said he wants to sign what he’s dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by July 4.\n\n\nBut college-accessibility advocates have warned that the legislation will inevitably make college less affordable and loans more difficult to pay off for millions of Americans.\n\n\nTransUnion: 5M Borrowers Could Default by September\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/25/transunion-5m-borrowers-could-default-september\n\nThe TransUnion analysis found that as of April 2025, nearly one-third of borrowers were more than 90 days past due on their loans—a roughly 10-percentage-point jump compared to February 2025. Before the government paused payments in spring 2020 because of the pandemic, just 11.7 percent of borrowers fell into this category.\n\n\nBorrowers default when they are 270 days behind on their payments. TransUnion expects about 1.8 million borrowers to default in July, followed by another million in August and then another two million in September.\n\n\nThe Education Department resumed debt collections in May—the first time in more than three years that borrowers who defaulted on their loans faced the harshest consequences. Since that announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and other officials have worked to spread the word about the consequences of default and defended the restart as necessary to shore up the student loan system. They’ve encouraged borrowers to get in touch with their student loan servicer and urged colleges to get involved as well.\n\n\nThe Trump administration did plan to withhold some federal benefits such as tax returns and Social Security checks, but officials later backed off that part of that plan.\n\n\nBut so far, the department has held off on restarting its automatic wage garnishment system, in which they can dock up to 15 percent of a defaulted borrower’s paycheck. The agency plans to resume that system this summer.\n\n\nGraduate Programs Face a Federal Reckoning\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/graduate/2025/06/26/can-graduate-programs-survive-federal-loan-caps\n\nCongress wants to significantly cut back on federal loans for grad students. That could decimate the highly profitable graduate degree market—and limit who has access to it.\n\n\nThe Senate version of the reconciliation bill, which President Donald Trump has urged Congress to pass as early as next week, would cap professional degree loans at $200,000 and all other graduate loans at $100,000. Both the House and the Senate also proposed completely eliminating Grad PLUS, an unsubsidized federal loan with no borrowing limit that has helped students from modest backgrounds pay for graduate degrees since 2006.\n\n(This doesn’t seem to have an impact on CUNY students)\n\nEducation Department Outlines Plan to Change Debt-Relief Program for Public Servants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/06/26/education-department-outlines-plan-change-pslf-rules\n(This is a bit misplaced, but this would impact CUNY students)\n\nCritics worry that the changes could derail debt relief for borrowers and allow the administration to block funds from reaching public servants who work in fields or for employers that the president disagrees with.\n\n\n“The law does not empower the Secretary of Education to opine on the supposed illegality of a public service employer’s mission—an unprecedented exercise of executive power that extends far beyond the Higher Education Act,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, which shared a copy of the issue paper with Inside Higher Ed.",

    "text": "NYTimes: Harvard and Trump Restart Talks to Potentially End Bitter Dispute\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/politics/harvard-federal-funding-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIt is unclear how close both sides are to a potential deal and the exact terms any final agreement would entail. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said it was “very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so.”\n\n\nHarvard has been widely praised by Democrats, academics, its alumni and democracy advocates for fighting the Trump administration. But top Harvard officials, according to two people briefed on the matter, have become increasingly convinced in recent weeks that the school has little choice but to try to strike a deal with the White House.\n\n\nThe Harvard officials believe that if the university remains at odds with the administration that it is likely to become far smaller and less ambitious as Mr. Trump tries to keep pummeling it with funding cuts, federal investigations and limits on visas for international students.\n\n\nIn exchange, Harvard would agree to take even more aggressive action than it already has to address issues such as antisemitism, race, and viewpoint diversity. The White House has pushed Harvard to make new commitments to change its admissions and hiring practices, one of the people close to the negotiations said.\n\n\nThe White House, according to one person briefed on the negotiations, hopes that an agreement with Harvard might serve as a framework for other elite colleges to strike deals with Mr. Trump. Other schools have been in discussions with the Trump administration about making deals that would keep their federal funding intact and avoid the president’s ire, two of the people said.\n\n\nAmong other conditions, the administration wanted Harvard to establish “merit based” hiring and admissions policies, and to see the influence of its faculty curbed. It sought a review for “viewpoint diversity,” the shutdown of any programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, and an outside review to examine “those programs and departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.”\n\n\nThe government also asked for Harvard to adjust its “recruitment, screening and admissions of international students,” audits of university data and reports “at least until the end of 2028” about the university’s compliance with the Trump administration’s conditions.\n\n\nUntil recently, though, Harvard’s top board resisted talks. The members directed the school’s battalion of lawyers, many of them fixtures of conservative legal circles, not to engage with the government.\n\n\nThe calculus has since shifted, in parallel with a handful of courtroom successes for Harvard and Mr. Trump’s public venting that the university had drawn a favorable judge.\n\n(Anyways, if Harvard bends it will be a gigantic blow to higher education. This article tries to narrow the “deal” to it impacting other top colleges, but this just opens the gates to asking for more and more and more, as the same threats can be reapplied by an administration that doesn’t honor past “deals”.)\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Live Updates: Federal Judge Blocks Efforts to Keep International Students Out of Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/20/us/trump-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nHarvard dispute: A federal judge on Friday froze the Trump administration’s effort to stop international students from enrolling at Harvard University.

It does not address President Donald Trump’s executive proclamation from earlier this month banning the State Department from issuing visas to international students and researchers attending Harvard; a temporary restriction on that ban expired June 20.\n\n\nNYTimes: ‘Are We Past Peak Harvard?’: 3 Writers Mull Higher Education’s Woes\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/opinion/trump-higher-education-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLarry Summers: Maybe, but there are countervailing forces. Harvard’s relative prestige rises with the square of the distance from Cambridge, and so a global talent competition helps it. The greatest universities are drivers of progress. The 21st century will be a center of the life sciences, and because of Harvard, M.I.T. and their affiliates, Boston and Cambridge are ground zero, creating a flywheel effect with Stanford and digital technology. If anything, the trend is toward a higher fraction of government, business, artistic elites coming from elite schools as they get better at drawing talent.\n\n\nSummers: The trend could break if Trump stays super-destructive, courts are super-tolerant and the universities don’t adapt and settle. That is a real worry. My best guess, though, is that the need for universities as economic engines, the enforcement of law and the fact that there is low-hanging fruit for cultural correction in the universities will carry the day. I don’t think there is yet evidence of leading universities losing their appeal. Yes, there is a need to walk back from crazy, as there was after the 1960s. My guess is this will happen. You will see versions of Stanford’s Hoover Institution on many campuses, more emphasis on nonideological science and a big walk back on identity politics.\n\n\nBruni: Ross, it’s clear that Trump and his allies actually don’t want sweeping protections for free speech. They correctly called out intolerance on the left but are now replacing it with intolerance from the right. When you’re essentially banning any mention of D.E.I., detaining students for political viewpoints they’ve articulated, putting institutions on notice that you’ll punish them for any deviation from just-two-genders orthodoxy, well, Trump is swapping one cancel culture for another.

Bollinger, a former president of Columbia University and the University of Michigan, said that Harvard stood at a critical juncture in the history of American academia.\n\n\n“How you conduct yourself in these moments will say a lot over the future,” he said.\n\n\nHe warned that allowing the government a say in hiring was a perilous threat to “a core, core academic freedom principle.”\n\n\nMany around academia are wary of the White House’s record. …\n\n\nWith stakes high, White House pushes negotiations with Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/24/with-stakes-high-white-house-pushes-negotiations-with-harvard/\n\nThe Trump administration is ramping up negotiations with Harvard University in an effort to reach an end to its months-long battle with the elite school, two senior White House officials have said, as Harvard has been racking up legal wins in court.\n\n\nThe administration expects a deal to land by the end of the month, one official said, and hopes the agreement would make a big enough splash to “basically be a blueprint for the rest of higher education.” The White House officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\n\nHarvard declined to comment.\n\n\nHarvard allies, free-speech advocates and others have feared that the Trump administration would use its attacks on Harvard to exert control over universities nationwide and dismantle academic freedom. Whatever the outcome, the case will create a significant precedent, said higher education attorney Sarah Hartley.\n\n\n“This is the playbook to be used with other universities by the government going forward,” said Hartley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm BCLP. “It, in many ways, is being used as a test of democracy and what the government can force on private institutions.”\n\n\nThe government may have more motivation to come to a settlement outside of court than Harvard does, said higher education attorney Jodie Ferise, who believes Harvard has a stronger legal case.\n\n\n“The White House has every incentive to want to reach some kind of compromise, because I don’t think they’ll win this case,” she said.\n\n\n“The government cannot attempt a hostile takeover of any private institution, much less a private college or university, in order to impose its preferred vision of ideological balance,” the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in a brief filed with seven other organizations, including the right-leaning Cato Institute and Rutherford Institute.\n\n\nHarvard scientist accused of smuggling frog embryos faces new charges\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/26/harvard-researcher-frog-embryos-ice/\n\nIf convicted on the felony smuggling charge, Petrova could face up to 20 years in prison and be fined as much as $250,000.

One of the laws requires public colleges and universities to eliminate programs with low numbers of degrees averaged over a three-year period. The cutoff is 15 graduates for a bachelor’s degree, seven for a master’s and three for a doctorate.\n\n\nSo far, most faculty don’t know what to expect. President-elect of the Bloomington Faculty Council Heather Akou said she hasn’t heard anything from the university but that it’s “aggressively” moving to get in line with the law. “There are going to be big changes for this university, and the pace at which this is being pushed through is not designed for positive outcomes,” she said. “I have to say that my faculty colleagues are in panic to a degree that I have never seen before.”\n\n\nMost of the degrees with low numbers of recipients are in the humanities and languages. Jewish Studies, Classical Studies and multiple language departments could lose their main offerings. From 2020 to 2022, IU Bloomington conferred more humanities doctorates than any other university in the country, according to data from Carnegie Classifications. It also ranks first for number of languages taught, for now.\n\n\n“Even tenured faculty are wondering, am I going to have a job in two months?” Akou said. “We’re scheduled to teach classes. Will I be allowed to teach the classes I’m scheduled to teach this fall? I don’t know. That’s really the level of chaos and confusion that’s going on right now.” The university declined an interview, but spokesperson Mark Bode wrote in an email that “IU is working with campus leaders to comply with the process mandated by state law.”\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Dept. says it is investigating Univ. of California hiring practices\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/26/university-california-trump-dei-investigation-hiring-justice/\n\nIn a letter to University of California President Michael Drake dated Thursday, the Justice Department claimed a strategic growth plan created by the UC system that mentions diversity in hiring suggests that the educational institution “may be engaged” in discriminatory employment practices based on race or sex.\n\n(May be the only people who take a strategic plan so seriously; ours is here https://www.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/about/chancellor/strategic-roadmap/CUNY_Lifting_New_York.pdf )\n\nThe antisemitism probe at the UC system is supposed to determine whether a “hostile work environment” has existed for Jewish employees on its campuses. The investigation announced Monday, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, will similarly seek to determine whether discrimination has existed in UC hiring.\n\n\n“It is important to note that we have not reached any conclusions about the subject matter of the investigation. We intend to consider all relevant information,” Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said in her letter to Drake.\n\n\nDhillon’s letter did not detail specific allegations of instances of hiring discrimination. She cited the University of California 2030 Capacity Plan as having “precipitated unlawful action,” specifically employment practices that may have discriminated against “employees, job applicants and training program participants based on race and sex.”\n\n\nIn its strategic plan, the University of California says it is “committed to increasing the diversity of its faculty, both underrepresented minorities and female faculty.” The plan discusses efforts to diversify the faculty so that campuses better reflect the population of California, a goal partially rooted in helping populations who are less likely to graduate from college earn degrees.",

It called for “intrinsic goodness” and recognizing the value of “liberal systems and methods” over “violence and bullying and the suppression of freedom of the press.”\n\n\nBut exactly a century later, a modern group of academics, researchers and writers around the world is giving it another go — fearing that the world is once again sleepwalking into dictatorship and violence.

But Tulane leaders have chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.”\n\n\n“It started with the pro-Palestinian activism on our campus and others across the country. It’s emboldened a lot of political leaders to feel they can make inroads by silencing faculty in other areas,” Michelle Lacey, a math professor and president of Tulane’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, told Inside Higher Ed. “That was the catalyst for creating a climate where university administrators are very nervous, especially now as we see the government pulling funding for areas of research they don’t like.”\n\n\nLast summer, he [Governor Landry, Trump aligned[ enacted a law that allows him to directly appoint board chairs at the state’s public colleges and universities.

The ostensible reason offered is so that State Department officials can conduct additional vetting of visas applicants, by reviewing their social media accounts. According to reports, the cable reads: “Effective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consular sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor (F, M, and J) visa appointment capacity until further guidance is issued [in a separate, forthcoming telegram], which we anticipate in the coming days.”\n\n\nState Dept. restarts student visa interviews with tougher social media rules\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/18/student-visas-social-media-vetting-state-department/\n\nAs staff members examine students’ profiles, the cable instructed, they must look to “identify applicants who bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles; who advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists and other threats to U.S. national security; or who perpetrate unlawful antisemitic harassment or violence.”\n\n\nOne State department official noted that the agency issued 446,000 student visas in 2023. “If everyone has to now have their social media scrubbed for derogatory information? Officers do not have that time.”\n\n\nThe cable suggested that State Department officials should request that applicants make public and accessible all portions of their social media accounts and should penalize them if they refuse.\n\n\nIf portions of accounts remain “set to ‘private’ or otherwise limited, you should treat the case as any other where an applicant fails to provide certain information on request,” the cable stated. It added, in a bolded sentence, “You must consider whether such failure reflects evasiveness or otherwise calls into question the applicant’s credibility.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/18/social-media-screening-student-visas-00413160\n(Also)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/us/politics/student-visa-applications.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDOJ Targets In-State Tuition for Noncitizens in Kentucky as Texas Students Fight Back\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/20/after-texas-doj-targets-kentuckys-state-tuition\n\nThe Justice Department sued Kentucky politicians over in-state tuition benefits for undocumented students, just as Texas students and advocates are pushing back against a lawsuit that killed a similar state policy.\n\n\nThe department filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky on Tuesday challenging the in-state tuition policy for undocumented students. The lawsuit, which names Democratic governor Andy Beshear, Commissioner of Education Robbie Fletcher and the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education, takes issue with a policy that allows graduates of Kentucky high schools who live in the state, regardless of citizenship, to access in-state tuition benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Universities Would Overhaul Research Funding\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/18/university-leaders-weigh-changes-research\n\nNow, after just over six weeks of work, that group known as the Joint Associations Group is homing in on a plan to rework how the government funds research, and they want feedback from the university research community before they present a proposal to Congress and the Trump administration at the end of the month.\n\n\n“Unfortunately, something is going to change,” said Barbara Snyder, president of the Association of American Universities. “Either we will be part of it or it will be imposed upon us … Significant division in the research community is going to kill us.”\n\n\nBoth versions of what JAG is calling the Fiscal Accountability in Research model, or FAIR, are geared toward offering more accountability and transparency about how federal research dollars are spent. JAG hopes that in the end, the new model will be simpler than the current one. They also want to nix terms like “indirect costs rate” and “overhead” for either essential research support or general research operations in an effort to underscore that the money goes toward the real costs of research.\n\n\nOne model, which the group calls FAIR No. 1, would include costs related to managing the grant, general research operations and facilities as a fixed percentage of the total budget. The percentage would be based in part on the type of institution and research. This approach is designed to be simple and reasonable, according to the group’s presentation, but it’s more general, which makes it “difficult to account for the wide array of research frameworks that now exist.”\n\n\nThe other model, FAIR No. 2, would more accurately reflect the actual costs of a project and make the structure for federal grants more like those from private foundations. Under this model, essential research support would be lumped into the project costs while funding for general research operations, such as payroll and procurement, would be a fixed percentage of the total budget. That change would likely increase the direct costs of the project.\n\n\nResearch Grants Increasingly Require Compliance With Trump’s Orders. Here’s How Colleges Are Responding.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/research-grants-increasingly-require-compliance-with-trumps-orders-heres-how-colleges-are-responding\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the conditions for accepting federal funding have become increasingly partisan. The Chronicle first reported in May that at least two notice-of-award letters from the National Institutes of Health, which are legal documents spelling out the terms of grants, mandated compliance with Trump’s executive order recognizing only two sexes, effectively excluding transgender people from U.S. policy.\n\n\nNow, according to scientists and colleges contacted by The Chronicle, an increasing number of grant letters — from the NIH and other agencies — require compliance with one or more of Trump’s executive orders and with civil-rights laws, which Trump has sought to reinterpret.\n\n\nIn one striking example of the ever-changing environment, the NIH announced a policy in April that required grantees to attest that they don’t operate “illegal” diversity, equity, and inclusion programs or support boycotts of Israel when accepting federal funds. But over the past week, the policy was abruptly rescinded, then put back in place, then rescinded again without explanation.\n\n\nA federal judge announced a short-term win for scientists on Monday, ruling that Trump’s termination of hundreds of grants because they referenced DEI or LGBTQ issues was discriminatory, and ordering the government to restore the funding.\n\n\nHow Senate Republicans Want to Hold Colleges Accountable\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/06/20/how-senate-republicans-want-hold-colleges-accountable\n\nThe high chamber’s proposal, which ties a university’s access to federal loans to how much their students earn after graduation, is simpler and more productive than the House proposal, known as risk-sharing, which would require colleges to pay an annual penalty based on their students’ outstanding loan balances, they say.\n\n\nThe Senate plan seems to be based on an existing regulation known as gainful employment, which uses students’ earnings and debt to measure whether for-profit and non-degree programs adequately prepare their students for the workforce. But Republicans who sponsored the bill and expanded its reach to all degree programs have been wary of drawing attention to the overlap, as lawmakers have avoided calling it anything like “gainful employment 2.0” or “gainful for all.”\n\n\nRepublicans have historically opposed the Democratic policy, which was first put in place during the Obama administration, saying it unfairly targeted for-profit programs and that a free market would be the best way to regulate the quality of academic programs.\n\n\nCongressional Republicans Want to End Grad PLUS Loans. How Might It Affect Your Campus?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/congressional-republicans-want-to-end-grad-plus-loans-how-might-it-affect-your-campus\n\nCongressional Republicans appear set to effectively shut down the 20-year-old Grad PLUS federal student-loan program as House and Senate lawmakers seek passage of a sprawling set of budget cuts, tax adjustments, and policy changes — bundled together and branded by President Trump as the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n\nwould see the Grad PLUS loan program, which had been expected to lend out roughly $19 billion annually between 2026-34, phased out for new borrowers starting in the 2026-27 academic year.

Here’s why that’s dangerous.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/18/trump-science-attacks-internet/\n\nThe evisceration of the National Science Foundation (NSF) — including wholesale firings, budget-slashing and arbitrary elimination of grants — is especially worrisome to those of us who understand the crucial role science has played in making America a great and powerful nation. Congress must act soon to halt this devastating attack.\n\n\nAt its heart was a management ethos borrowed from successful wartime research: the idea that knowledgeable scientists could identify the most fruitful topics and the best ways to pursue them. T\n\n\nIn the past, the NSF has usually enjoyed bipartisan support from both presidents and members of Congress. But the ravages currently being inflicted upon the agency may bring a truly golden era of American science to a halt. The February dismissal of 168 “probationary” NSF employees included career scientists newly arrived from academic positions to work as program managers familiar with the scientific disciplines they were to oversee. Though some have been reinstated by court order, the chilling uncertainty this ill-considered action instills in the NSF workforce and its grantees can seriously harm U.S. science.\n\n\nWhat’s worse, the 2026 fiscal year Trump budget calls for slashing $5 billion from the current $9 billion NSF budget. That would be the death knell of the storied agency as it has been known for decades\n\n\n\n\n\ntracking site\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda#research\n\nThe Scientific Research Lost Amid the Trump Administration’s NIH Cuts — ProPublica\n\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/nih-cuts-research-lost-trump/\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is responsible for more than 80% of the world’s grant investment in biomedical research. Its funding has sparked countless medical breakthroughs — on cancer, diabetes, strokes — and plays a fundamental role in the development of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n\nThe NIH has rarely revoked funding once it has been awarded. Out of the tens of thousands of grants overseen by the institution since 2012, it terminated fewer than five for violations of the agency’s terms and conditions.\n\n\nThen Donald Trump was reelected.\n\n\nSince his January inauguration, his administration has terminated more than 1,450 grants, withholding more than $750 million in funds; officials have said they are curbing wasteful spending and “unscientific” research.\n\n\nThe mass cancellation of grants in response to political policy shifts has no precedent, former and current NIH officials told ProPublica. It threatens the stability of the institution and the scientific enterprise of the nation at large.\n\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the toll, ProPublica reached out to more than 500 researchers, scientists and investigators whose grants were terminated. More than 150 responded to share their experiences, which reveal consequences that experts say run counter to scientific logic and even common sense.\n\n(Well worth reading to gain a sense of scale of this sabotage)\n\nTrump’s NIH Axed Research Grants Despite Court Order — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/trump-nih-cuts-transgender-research-grants\n(And more details on sabotage at the NIH)\n\nNearly two weeks after the court’s preliminary injunction was issued, the National Institutes of Health’s then-acting head, Dr. Matthew J. Memoli, drafted a memo that details how the agency, in response to Trump’s executive orders, cut funding for research grants that “promote or inculcate gender ideology.” An internal spreadsheet of terminated NIH grants also references “gender ideology” and lists the number associated with Trump’s executive order as the reason for the termination of more than a half dozen research grants. [Yet, “Lawyers for the federal government have repeatedly claimed in court filings that the administration has been complying with the order (stopping it from cutting funding related to gender identity and the provision of gender-affirming care in response to President Donald Trump’s executive orders)”]\n\n\nThe Washington attorney general’s allegation that the Trump administration violated a court order comes as the country lurches toward a constitutional crisis amid accusations that the executive branch has defied or ignored court orders in several other cases.\n\n\nin depositions filed in the case last week, two NIH officials testified that DOGE itself gave directions in hundreds of grant terminations.\n\n\nThe lawsuit offers an unprecedented view into the termination of more than 600 grants at the NIH over the past two months. Many of the canceled grants appear to have focused on subjects that the administration claims are unscientific or that the agency should no longer focus on under new priorities, such as gender identity, vaccine hesitancy and diversity, equity and inclusion. Grants related to research in China have also been cut, and climate change projects are under scrutiny.\n\n\nMike Faulk, the deputy communications director for the Washington state attorney general’s office, told ProPublica in an email that the administration “appears to have used DOGE in this instance to keep career NIH officials in the dark about what was happening and why.” “While claiming to be transparent, DOGE has actively hidden its activities and its true motivations,” he said.\n\n\n“Their claim to have complied with the preliminary injunction is almost laughable,” said Faulk, the office’s deputy communications director. “The Trump administration is playing games with no apparent respect for the rule of law.”\n\n\nThe executive order detailing DOGE’s responsibilities describes the cost-cutting team as advisers that consult agency heads on the termination of contracts and grants. No language in the orders gives the DOGE team members the authority to direct the cancellation of grants or contracts. However, the depositions portray Riley [former consultant for McKinsey & Co. and DOGE member] as giving directions on how to conduct the terminations.\n\n\nJeremy Berg, who led the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the NIH from 2003 to 2011, told ProPublica that the administration’s assessment of the institution was “not fair and not based on any substantial analysis or evidence,” and the proposed cuts “would be absolutely devastating to NIH and to biomedical research in the United States.”\n\n\nJudge Rejects Trump’s ‘Appalling’ NIH LGBTQ, Race Grant Cuts\n\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/judge-clashes-with-trump-justice-department-over-nih-grant-cuts\n(Thanks KB)\n\n“This represents racial discrimination and discrimination against America’s LGBTQ community.

A hearing in the case is set for July 2.\n\n\nFor example, Johns Hopkins and the DOD currently have in place a negotiated indirect cost rate of 55 percent. In 2024 JHU received $32 million from the DOD to cover indirect costs, according to the lawsuit. If the DOD’s plan moves forward, however, the university would lose $22 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTennessee Lawsuit Puts HSIs’ Fate on the Line\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/13/tenn-lawsuit-puts-hispanic-servings-fate-line\n\nTwo years after its Supreme Court victory against Harvard and UNC Chapel Hill, Students for Fair Admissions has a new target in its sights: Hispanic-serving institutions.

Now, obscured by the turmoil of the many other challenges to higher education since the start of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, tenure has come under siege in states across the country.\n\n\n“It’s the flip side of the same assault,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, or AFT, which represents 400,000 faculty and other university and college employees. “Some of the assault is coming from taking away grants, and some of the assault is coming by taking away tenure.”\n\n(But it doesn’t seem to be driven by a newly appointed leader)\n\n“To me, it’s about the Senate wanting control over the university,” said Christian Fern, executive director of the University of Hawai‘i Professional Assembly, the faculty union.\n\n(States mentioned: Hawaii, Nebraska, Ohio, Kentucky, Texas, Indiana, Arkansas, North Dakota, Kansas)\n\n“This level of attack couldn’t gain the kind of momentum it has without the declining public support for higher education,” Reuben [Harvard historian] said. “It couldn’t have happened to this magnitude before, because there was a general sense that higher education was good for society.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Will Ask a Judge to Block Trump From Barring International Students\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/us/harvard-international-students-lawsuit-injunction.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe hearing follows at least four different attempts by Trump administration officials to end or limit Harvard’s foreign enrollment. If they succeed, it could affect about 7,000 international scholars and potentially deliver a disabling blow to the campus’s finances, curriculum and identity.\n\n\nIn their court filing, Harvard’s lawyers argued that broad language was necessary because the government had “committed to continuing — indeed to intensifying — its retaliatory campaign,” one that can “throw Harvard and its international community into turmoil.”\n\n\nThe litigation, which is one of two cases Harvard has filed against the Trump administration, began last month when the Department of Homeland Security said it was revoking Harvard’s ability to host students under a system called the Student Exchange and Visitor Program.\n\n\nA lawyer for Harvard, Ian Gershengorn, accused the administration of resorting to “shenanigans” in its efforts to bar foreign students from Harvard.\n\n\nHarvard has said the actions aren’t grounded in real violations but instead are retaliation for its refusal to bend to the administration’s will.\n\n\nJudge Waits to Rule on Trump’s Effort to Bar Harvard Foreign Students\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/17/judge-delays-ruling-trump-ban-harvard-foreign\n\nIn a hearing on Monday, a federal judge put off making a ruling on whether to continue blocking President Trump’s proclamation banning Harvard international students and researchers from entering the country. The judge, Allison Burroughs of the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, agreed to decide within a week and extended an order to temporarily halt the policy until then.\n\n\nThe hearing came after Harvard swiftly filed a legal challenge to Trump’s directive in early June, a day after it was issued. Burroughs quickly granted a temporary restraining order and is now weighing a longer-lasting injunction.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Negotiation or Capitulation? How Columbia Got Off Trump’s Hot Seat.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/nyregion/columbia-middle-east-studies-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nWhile many in the academic world have accused Columbia of caving to Mr. Trump’s pressure, the university’s strategy — so far — has limited the bleeding, even as Harvard has absorbed cut after cut, stretching into billions of dollars. While opponents of the Trump administration’s crackdown have lauded Harvard for standing its ground, it is far from clear which school will be better off in the long run. And the question remains whether Columbia’s path can offer a road map for other universities attacked by the president.\n\n\nStill, the federal Department of Education threatened Columbia’s accreditation in early June, saying that in its eyes, the school was no longer meeting the standards necessary for the key credential, alleging it had “acted with deliberate indifference” toward the harassment of Jewish students.\n\n\n“There is a basic principle of academic freedom that is under attack, but I still believe in it,” he said. “And I think everybody in this department believes in it. And I think the students we teach believe in it.”\n\n\nFederal Judge Dismisses AAUP Lawsuit Challenging Columbia Grant Freezes\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/17/judge-dismisses-lawsuit-over-columbia-grant-freezes\n\nJudge Mary Kay Vyskocil of the Southern District of New York, however, ruled that the unions had no standing to file the lawsuit in the first place—only the university could do that, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration froze Northwestern’s research funding. It hasn’t offered the school a way to get it back.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/northwestern-funding-freeze-trump-85d49da2?st=fGDDU3&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nThrough the spring, Northwestern used university money to pay bills previously covered by NIH grants, spending tens of millions of dollars monthly to keep labs and trials running without a break. Researchers and administrators now worry this stopgap can’t last.\n\n\n“The university is totally keeping us on life support,” said Dr. Daniela Matei, a Northwestern oncologist. “The big question is for how long they can do this.”\n\n\nThe sudden collapse of the once-symbiotic relationship between the federal government and higher education is torpedoing a half-century-old university business model and upending how science is done.\n\n\nIt’s a complete turnaround for today’s university researchers, for whom federal funding—from NIH, National Science Foundation, and other agencies—has never been in question. Billions of dollars have flowed annually to universities through competitive grants, funding basic research that can lead to cutting-edge medicine and technological innovations.\n\n\nAt places like Harvard and Columbia, funding cuts or freezes have come with lists of demands spanning changes to admissions and faculty hiring.\n\n\nAt others, like Northwestern, the path to restoration is less clear. In April, a Trump administration official told media that $790 million in federal funds to the Illinois university would be frozen, but that number has never been detailed or communicated directly to school officials, a school spokesman said. Nor has Trump told the university what they can do to get the money returned, the spokesman said, though the school’s president has met with Trump’s education secretary to discuss the situation on campus.\n\n\nUniversity officials say bills to NIH have simply gone unpaid. NIH grant officers in April were told not to communicate with Northwestern and other affected universities about the freeze, according to an email viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Northwestern researchers have had grants terminated or frozen from multiple agencies, the university said.\n\n\nFacing Research Cuts, Officials at U. of Iowa Spoke of a ‘Limited Ability to Publicly Fight This’\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/facing-research-cuts-officials-at-u-of-iowa-spoke-of-a-limited-ability-to-publicly-fight-this\n\nAsked by a faculty member what he and his peers could do to help, the University of Iowa’s interim vice president for research suggested only “acting as a private citizen to call our legislators and tell them what a bad idea this is (from your own phone or using your own email).” The campus’s location in a solidly red state hindered it from fighting the policy change, Lois J.

But that is just one factor contributing to higher education’s financial crunch. Colleges, like businesses and households, are facing greater costs for wages, supplies, utilities and other expenses.\n\n\nIn Minnesota, students are set to pay more for less. … Tuition at the Twin Cities campus will rise by at least 6.5 percent.

The use of LLM had a measurable impact on participants, and while the benefits were initially apparent, as we demonstrated over the course of 4 months, the LLM group’s participants performed worse than their counterparts in the Brain-only group at all levels: neural, linguistic, scoring.\n\n\nWhat Will Be Left of Higher Ed in Four Years?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-will-be-left-of-higher-ed-in-four-years\n\nA recent report from the consulting firm Deloitte confirms what everyone working in higher education already knows: Donald Trump “brings a layer of complexity to questions of financial sustainability for colleges and universities.” The administration’s dizzying range of punitive measures for academe comes at an inconvenient time: Our institutions are already grappling with diminished state support and a looming demographic cliff.\n\n\nResearch universities face the greatest financial pressure. Grant cancellations and planned cuts to the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health are creating enormous budgetary holes: The budgets for graduate programs and scientific-research staffing were developed on the assumption that federal funding was a constant.\n\n\nIn red states like Florida, Indiana, and Texas, Trump-supporting Legislatures are also working to bust up faculty and administrative autonomy as a condition of public funding. The administration’s cultural agenda for higher ed is likely to be advanced most fully in states where MAGA-friendly legislatures have near-total control. This doesn’t mean blue-state public research universities are off the hook. Data shows that state financial support for higher ed has been up over the past couple of years, but we might have reached high tide. Ebbing state funding would pair dangerously with cuts to federal research.\n\n\nRegional Publics and Community Colleges\n\n\nAt first glance these institutions appear to be in an enviable position: They don’t rely heavily on federal research funding, they don’t have big endowments to tax, they don’t enroll lots of international students, and they tend to fly below the political radar. Domestic undergraduate enrollment is unlikely to collapse, and a looming economic downturn could even cause an uptick in demand for these institutions since people look to increase their skills and retrain during recessions. Still, the major financial-aid reform provisions tucked away in the “Big, Beautiful” reconciliation bill recently passed by the House will clearly affect these institutions if enacted, though in mixed ways. For community colleges, their lower tuition prices, shorter program duration, and a vocational orientation might yield comparative advantages in a world with diminished federal student aid. Risk-sharing provisions that put campuses on the hook for portions of unpaid student debt might harm minority-serving institutions and campuses that serve low-income and other students with historically higher rates of loan default. Requiring full-time enrollment for Pell Grant eligibility, as proposed in the House bill, would harm these institutions too. The Senate seems less excited about the risk-sharing and full-time Pell provisions, but the financial-aid outlook remains murky.\n\n\nRegional universities and community colleges also face enrollment risks. Pennsylvania State University plans to shutter several regional campuses, and federal pressure on research universities will have knock-on effects within state university systems. Looking to secure their own budgets, research universities might employ aggressive tactics to lure students otherwise headed to regional campuses.\n\n\nRather than forming partnerships with the federal government, colleges will now have to endure the headwinds created by federal policy and, in some cases, engage in direct confrontation with the administration. I do not believe Trump will be able to destroy American higher education, but his administration will try, and the sector will suffer. Research footprints will shrink, the number of programs and activities on offer will be reduced, and the workloads of already-overextended faculty and staff will increase. Senior administrators can’t say so, but in the next few years colleges and universities will become diminished versions of themselves. Those of us who teach or work in higher ed will watch our institutions decline.\n\n\nCampuses will look for revenue to replace federal dollars. Public research universities will increase their enrollments, often at the expense of their regional counterparts. Our wealthiest colleges may quietly roll back their need-blind admissions policies. The steady trickle of emails from university communications announcing exciting new cancer research efforts and new science facilities will slow. Departmental budgets will be slashed to the point where faculty concern is less for vanishing tenure lines than for the survival of the department itself. Teaching course loads will grow, library operational hours will shrink, and students, stung by loan restrictions and red tape, will increasingly rush from class to part-time jobs. In short, the sector will be smaller, poorer, and capable of doing fewer things.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Data Shows Attendance Fosters Student Success\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/student-success/academic-life/2025/06/13/data-shows-attendance-improves-student-success\n(Some headlines write themselves)\n\nWho’s missing class? It’s not uncommon for a student to miss class for illness or an outside conflict, but higher rates of absence among college students in recent years are giving professors pause.\n\n\nMore than 30 percent of students who attended community college in person skipped class sometimes in the past year, a 2023 study found; 4 percent said they skipped class often or very often.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

But Tulane leaders have chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.”\n\n\n“It started with the pro-Palestinian activism on our campus and others across the country. It’s emboldened a lot of political leaders to feel they can make inroads by silencing faculty in other areas,” Michelle Lacey, a math professor and president of Tulane’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, told Inside Higher Ed. “That was the catalyst for creating a climate where university administrators are very nervous, especially now as we see the government pulling funding for areas of research they don’t like.”\n\n\nLast summer, he [Governor Landry, Trump aligned[ enacted a law that allows him to directly appoint board chairs at the state’s public colleges and universities. And in November, following Trump’s election, Landry publicly called on officials at Louisiana State University to punish a law professor who allegedly made brief comments in class about students who voted for the president.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Is Replacing DEI?

The ostensible reason offered is so that State Department officials can conduct additional vetting of visas applicants, by reviewing their social media accounts. According to reports, the cable reads: “Effective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consular sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor (F, M, and J) visa appointment capacity until further guidance is issued [in a separate, forthcoming telegram], which we anticipate in the coming days.”\n\n\nState Dept. restarts student visa interviews with tougher social media rules\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/18/student-visas-social-media-vetting-state-department/\n\nAs staff members examine students’ profiles, the cable instructed, they must look to “identify applicants who bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles; who advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists and other threats to U.S. national security; or who perpetrate unlawful antisemitic harassment or violence.”\n\n\nOne State department official noted that the agency issued 446,000 student visas in 2023. “If everyone has to now have their social media scrubbed for derogatory information? Officers do not have that time.”\n\n\nThe cable suggested that State Department officials should request that applicants make public and accessible all portions of their social media accounts and should penalize them if they refuse.\n\n\nIf portions of accounts remain “set to ‘private’ or otherwise limited, you should treat the case as any other where an applicant fails to provide certain information on request,” the cable stated. It added, in a bolded sentence, “You must consider whether such failure reflects evasiveness or otherwise calls into question the applicant’s credibility.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/18/social-media-screening-student-visas-00413160\n(Also)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/us/politics/student-visa-applications.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDOJ Targets In-State Tuition for Noncitizens in Kentucky as Texas Students Fight Back\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/20/after-texas-doj-targets-kentuckys-state-tuition\n\nThe Justice Department sued Kentucky politicians over in-state tuition benefits for undocumented students, just as Texas students and advocates are pushing back against a lawsuit that killed a similar state policy.\n\n\nThe department filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky on Tuesday challenging the in-state tuition policy for undocumented students. The lawsuit, which names Democratic governor Andy Beshear, Commissioner of Education Robbie Fletcher and the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education, takes issue with a policy that allows graduates of Kentucky high schools who live in the state, regardless of citizenship, to access in-state tuition benefits."

    "text": "How Universities Would Overhaul Research Funding\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/18/university-leaders-weigh-changes-research\n\nNow, after just over six weeks of work, that group known as the Joint Associations Group is homing in on a plan to rework how the government funds research, and they want feedback from the university research community before they present a proposal to Congress and the Trump administration at the end of the month.\n\n\n“Unfortunately, something is going to change,” said Barbara Snyder, president of the Association of American Universities. “Either we will be part of it or it will be imposed upon us … Significant division in the research community is going to kill us.”\n\n\nBoth versions of what JAG is calling the Fiscal Accountability in Research model, or FAIR, are geared toward offering more accountability and transparency about how federal research dollars are spent. JAG hopes that in the end, the new model will be simpler than the current one. They also want to nix terms like “indirect costs rate” and “overhead” for either essential research support or general research operations in an effort to underscore that the money goes toward the real costs of research.\n\n\nOne model, which the group calls FAIR No. 1, would include costs related to managing the grant, general research operations and facilities as a fixed percentage of the total budget. The percentage would be based in part on the type of institution and research. This approach is designed to be simple and reasonable, according to the group’s presentation, but it’s more general, which makes it “difficult to account for the wide array of research frameworks that now exist.”\n\n\nThe other model, FAIR No. 2, would more accurately reflect the actual costs of a project and make the structure for federal grants more like those from private foundations. Under this model, essential research support would be lumped into the project costs while funding for general research operations, such as payroll and procurement, would be a fixed percentage of the total budget. That change would likely increase the direct costs of the project.\n\n\nResearch Grants Increasingly Require Compliance With Trump’s Orders. Here’s How Colleges Are Responding.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/research-grants-increasingly-require-compliance-with-trumps-orders-heres-how-colleges-are-responding\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the conditions for accepting federal funding have become increasingly partisan. The Chronicle first reported in May that at least two notice-of-award letters from the National Institutes of Health, which are legal documents spelling out the terms of grants, mandated compliance with Trump’s executive order recognizing only two sexes, effectively excluding transgender people from U.S. policy.\n\n\nNow, according to scientists and colleges contacted by The Chronicle, an increasing number of grant letters — from the NIH and other agencies — require compliance with one or more of Trump’s executive orders and with civil-rights laws, which Trump has sought to reinterpret.\n\n\nIn one striking example of the ever-changing environment, the NIH announced a policy in April that required grantees to attest that they don’t operate “illegal” diversity, equity, and inclusion programs or support boycotts of Israel when accepting federal funds. But over the past week, the policy was abruptly rescinded, then put back in place, then rescinded again without explanation.\n\n\nA federal judge announced a short-term win for scientists on Monday, ruling that Trump’s termination of hundreds of grants because they referenced DEI or LGBTQ issues was discriminatory, and ordering the government to restore the funding.\n\n\nHow Senate Republicans Want to Hold Colleges Accountable\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/06/20/how-senate-republicans-want-hold-colleges-accountable\n\nThe high chamber’s proposal, which ties a university’s access to federal loans to how much their students earn after graduation, is simpler and more productive than the House proposal, known as risk-sharing, which would require colleges to pay an annual penalty based on their students’ outstanding loan balances, they say.\n\n\nThe Senate plan seems to be based on an existing regulation known as gainful employment, which uses students’ earnings and debt to measure whether for-profit and non-degree programs adequately prepare their students for the workforce. But Republicans who sponsored the bill and expanded its reach to all degree programs have been wary of drawing attention to the overlap, as lawmakers have avoided calling it anything like “gainful employment 2.0” or “gainful for all.”\n\n\nRepublicans have historically opposed the Democratic policy, which was first put in place during the Obama administration, saying it unfairly targeted for-profit programs and that a free market would be the best way to regulate the quality of academic programs.\n\n\nCongressional Republicans Want to End Grad PLUS Loans. How Might It Affect Your Campus?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/congressional-republicans-want-to-end-grad-plus-loans-how-might-it-affect-your-campus\n\nCongressional Republicans appear set to effectively shut down the 20-year-old Grad PLUS federal student-loan program as House and Senate lawmakers seek passage of a sprawling set of budget cuts, tax adjustments, and policy changes — bundled together and branded by President Trump as the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n\nwould see the Grad PLUS loan program, which had been expected to lend out roughly $19 billion annually between 2026-34, phased out for new borrowers starting in the 2026-27 academic year. The program would eventually be mothballed for all borrowers starting in the 2029-30 academic year.\n\n(The interactive table has some detail\n\n\n\nCollege\nN\nDisbursement\n\n\n\n\nCCNY\n180\n3.3M\n\n\nGC\n193\n2.6M\n\n\nHunter\n114\n1.7M\n\n\nBaruch\n79\n1.6M\n\n\n\nBrooklyn, John Jay, York, Lehman, Queens, CSI also impacted ~ 2M combined)\n\nBut without access to Grad PLUS financing, said Suzanne Ortega, president of the Council of Graduate Schools, graduate-level education will either become unattainable for some students or “force them into high-cost private debt, exacerbating the student-debt crisis and existing work-force shortages in critical fields like teaching, law enforcement, public-health professions, and engineers.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump is undermining U.S. science. Here’s why that’s dangerous.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/18/trump-science-attacks-internet/\n\nThe evisceration of the National Science Foundation (NSF) — including wholesale firings, budget-slashing and arbitrary elimination of grants — is especially worrisome to those of us who understand the crucial role science has played in making America a great and powerful nation. Congress must act soon to halt this devastating attack.\n\n\nAt its heart was a management ethos borrowed from successful wartime research: the idea that knowledgeable scientists could identify the most fruitful topics and the best ways to pursue them. T\n\n\nIn the past, the NSF has usually enjoyed bipartisan support from both presidents and members of Congress. But the ravages currently being inflicted upon the agency may bring a truly golden era of American science to a halt. The February dismissal of 168 “probationary” NSF employees included career scientists newly arrived from academic positions to work as program managers familiar with the scientific disciplines they were to oversee. Though some have been reinstated by court order, the chilling uncertainty this ill-considered action instills in the NSF workforce and its grantees can seriously harm U.S. science.\n\n\nWhat’s worse, the 2026 fiscal year Trump budget calls for slashing $5 billion from the current $9 billion NSF budget. That would be the death knell of the storied agency as it has been known for decades\n\n\n\n\n\ntracking site\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda#research\n\nThe Scientific Research Lost Amid the Trump Administration’s NIH Cuts — ProPublica\n\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/nih-cuts-research-lost-trump/\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is responsible for more than 80% of the world’s grant investment in biomedical research. Its funding has sparked countless medical breakthroughs — on cancer, diabetes, strokes — and plays a fundamental role in the development of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n\nThe NIH has rarely revoked funding once it has been awarded. Out of the tens of thousands of grants overseen by the institution since 2012, it terminated fewer than five for violations of the agency’s terms and conditions.\n\n\nThen Donald Trump was reelected.\n\n\nSince his January inauguration, his administration has terminated more than 1,450 grants, withholding more than $750 million in funds; officials have said they are curbing wasteful spending and “unscientific” research.\n\n\nThe mass cancellation of grants in response to political policy shifts has no precedent, former and current NIH officials told ProPublica. It threatens the stability of the institution and the scientific enterprise of the nation at large.\n\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the toll, ProPublica reached out to more than 500 researchers, scientists and investigators whose grants were terminated. More than 150 responded to share their experiences, which reveal consequences that experts say run counter to scientific logic and even common sense.\n\n(Well worth reading to gain a sense of scale of this sabotage)\n\nTrump’s NIH Axed Research Grants Despite Court Order — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/trump-nih-cuts-transgender-research-grants\n(And more details on sabotage at the NIH)\n\nNearly two weeks after the court’s preliminary injunction was issued, the National Institutes of Health’s then-acting head, Dr. Matthew J. Memoli, drafted a memo that details how the agency, in response to Trump’s executive orders, cut funding for research grants that “promote or inculcate gender ideology.” An internal spreadsheet of terminated NIH grants also references “gender ideology” and lists the number associated with Trump’s executive order as the reason for the termination of more than a half dozen research grants. [Yet, “Lawyers for the federal government have repeatedly claimed in court filings that the administration has been complying with the order (stopping it from cutting funding related to gender identity and the provision of gender-affirming care in response to President Donald Trump’s executive orders)”]\n\n\nThe Washington attorney general’s allegation that the Trump administration violated a court order comes as the country lurches toward a constitutional crisis amid accusations that the executive branch has defied or ignored court orders in several other cases.\n\n\nin depositions filed in the case last week, two NIH officials testified that DOGE itself gave directions in hundreds of grant terminations.\n\n\nThe lawsuit offers an unprecedented view into the termination of more than 600 grants at the NIH over the past two months. Many of the canceled grants appear to have focused on subjects that the administration claims are unscientific or that the agency should no longer focus on under new priorities, such as gender identity, vaccine hesitancy and diversity, equity and inclusion. Grants related to research in China have also been cut, and climate change projects are under scrutiny.\n\n\nMike Faulk, the deputy communications director for the Washington state attorney general’s office, told ProPublica in an email that the administration “appears to have used DOGE in this instance to keep career NIH officials in the dark about what was happening and why.” “While claiming to be transparent, DOGE has actively hidden its activities and its true motivations,” he said.\n\n\n“Their claim to have complied with the preliminary injunction is almost laughable,” said Faulk, the office’s deputy communications director. “The Trump administration is playing games with no apparent respect for the rule of law.”\n\n\nThe executive order detailing DOGE’s responsibilities describes the cost-cutting team as advisers that consult agency heads on the termination of contracts and grants. No language in the orders gives the DOGE team members the authority to direct the cancellation of grants or contracts. However, the depositions portray Riley [former consultant for McKinsey & Co. and DOGE member] as giving directions on how to conduct the terminations.\n\n\nJeremy Berg, who led the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the NIH from 2003 to 2011, told ProPublica that the administration’s assessment of the institution was “not fair and not based on any substantial analysis or evidence,” and the proposed cuts “would be absolutely devastating to NIH and to biomedical research in the United States.”\n\n\nJudge Rejects Trump’s ‘Appalling’ NIH LGBTQ, Race Grant Cuts\n\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/judge-clashes-with-trump-justice-department-over-nih-grant-cuts\n(Thanks KB)\n\n“This represents racial discrimination and discrimination against America’s LGBTQ community. That’s what this is,” said Judge William G. Young of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts. “I would be blind not to call it out. My duty is to call it out.”\n\n(Also, from VAC)\nhttps://www.axios.com/local/boston/2025/06/16/nih-grants-ordered-restored\n(Also)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/16/us/trump-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\nUniversities Sue, Judge Blocks DOD’s Indirect Costs Cap\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/20/universities-sue-judge-blocks-dods-indirect-costs-cap\n\nJohns Hopkins, Arizona State and Cornell Universities are among a coalition of 12 higher education institutions and three trade groups that filed a lawsuit against the Department of Defense on Monday over the agency’s plan to cap universities’ indirect research cost rates at 15 percent.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge in Boston issued a temporary restraining order, prohibiting the DOD from enacting the cap. A hearing in the case is set for July 2.\n\n\nFor example, Johns Hopkins and the DOD currently have in place a negotiated indirect cost rate of 55 percent. In 2024 JHU received $32 million from the DOD to cover indirect costs, according to the lawsuit. If the DOD’s plan moves forward, however, the university would lose $22 million."

Now, obscured by the turmoil of the many other challenges to higher education since the start of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, tenure has come under siege in states across the country.\n\n\n“It’s the flip side of the same assault,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, or AFT, which represents 400,000 faculty and other university and college employees. “Some of the assault is coming from taking away grants, and some of the assault is coming by taking away tenure.”\n\n(But it doesn’t seem to be driven by a newly appointed leader)\n\n“To me, it’s about the Senate wanting control over the university,” said Christian Fern, executive director of the University of Hawai‘i Professional Assembly, the faculty union.\n\n(States mentioned: Hawaii, Nebraska, Ohio, Kentucky, Texas, Indiana, Arkansas, North Dakota, Kansas)\n\n“This level of attack couldn’t gain the kind of momentum it has without the declining public support for higher education,” Reuben [Harvard historian] said. “It couldn’t have happened to this magnitude before, because there was a general sense that higher education was good for society.”"

If they succeed, it could affect about 7,000 international scholars and potentially deliver a disabling blow to the campus’s finances, curriculum and identity.\n\n\nIn their court filing, Harvard’s lawyers argued that broad language was necessary because the government had “committed to continuing — indeed to intensifying — its retaliatory campaign,” one that can “throw Harvard and its international community into turmoil.”\n\n\nThe litigation, which is one of two cases Harvard has filed against the Trump administration, began last month when the Department of Homeland Security said it was revoking Harvard’s ability to host students under a system called the Student Exchange and Visitor Program.\n\n\nA lawyer for Harvard, Ian Gershengorn, accused the administration of resorting to “shenanigans” in its efforts to bar foreign students from Harvard.\n\n\nHarvard has said the actions aren’t grounded in real violations but instead are retaliation for its refusal to bend to the administration’s will.\n\n\nJudge Waits to Rule on Trump’s Effort to Bar Harvard Foreign Students\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/17/judge-delays-ruling-trump-ban-harvard-foreign\n\nIn a hearing on Monday, a federal judge put off making a ruling on whether to continue blocking President Trump’s proclamation banning Harvard international students and researchers from entering the country. The judge, Allison Burroughs of the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, agreed to decide within a week and extended an order to temporarily halt the policy until then.\n\n\nThe hearing came after Harvard swiftly filed a legal challenge to Trump’s directive in early June, a day after it was issued. Burroughs quickly granted a temporary restraining order and is now weighing a longer-lasting injunction.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Negotiation or Capitulation? How Columbia Got Off Trump’s Hot Seat.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/nyregion/columbia-middle-east-studies-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nWhile many in the academic world have accused Columbia of caving to Mr. Trump’s pressure, the university’s strategy — so far — has limited the bleeding, even as Harvard has absorbed cut after cut, stretching into billions of dollars. While opponents of the Trump administration’s crackdown have lauded Harvard for standing its ground, it is far from clear which school will be better off in the long run. And the question remains whether Columbia’s path can offer a road map for other universities attacked by the president.\n\n\nStill, the federal Department of Education threatened Columbia’s accreditation in early June, saying that in its eyes, the school was no longer meeting the standards necessary for the key credential, alleging it had “acted with deliberate indifference” toward the harassment of Jewish students.\n\n\n“There is a basic principle of academic freedom that is under attack, but I still believe in it,” he said. “And I think everybody in this department believes in it. And I think the students we teach believe in it.”\n\n\nFederal Judge Dismisses AAUP Lawsuit Challenging Columbia Grant Freezes\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/17/judge-dismisses-lawsuit-over-columbia-grant-freezes\n\nJudge Mary Kay Vyskocil of the Southern District of New York, however, ruled that the unions had no standing to file the lawsuit in the first place—only the university could do that, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration froze Northwestern’s research funding. It hasn’t offered the school a way to get it back.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/northwestern-funding-freeze-trump-85d49da2?st=fGDDU3&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nThrough the spring, Northwestern used university money to pay bills previously covered by NIH grants, spending tens of millions of dollars monthly to keep labs and trials running without a break. Researchers and administrators now worry this stopgap can’t last.\n\n\n“The university is totally keeping us on life support,” said Dr. Daniela Matei, a Northwestern oncologist. “The big question is for how long they can do this.”\n\n\nThe sudden collapse of the once-symbiotic relationship between the federal government and higher education is torpedoing a half-century-old university business model and upending how science is done.\n\n\nIt’s a complete turnaround for today’s university researchers, for whom federal funding—from NIH, National Science Foundation, and other agencies—has never been in question. Billions of dollars have flowed annually to universities through competitive grants, funding basic research that can lead to cutting-edge medicine and technological innovations.\n\n\nAt places like Harvard and Columbia, funding cuts or freezes have come with lists of demands spanning changes to admissions and faculty hiring.\n\n\nAt others, like Northwestern, the path to restoration is less clear. In April, a Trump administration official told media that $790 million in federal funds to the Illinois university would be frozen, but that number has never been detailed or communicated directly to school officials, a school spokesman said. Nor has Trump told the university what they can do to get the money returned, the spokesman said, though the school’s president has met with Trump’s education secretary to discuss the situation on campus.\n\n\nUniversity officials say bills to NIH have simply gone unpaid. NIH grant officers in April were told not to communicate with Northwestern and other affected universities about the freeze, according to an email viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Northwestern researchers have had grants terminated or frozen from multiple agencies, the university said.\n\n\nFacing Research Cuts, Officials at U. of Iowa Spoke of a ‘Limited Ability to Publicly Fight This’\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/facing-research-cuts-officials-at-u-of-iowa-spoke-of-a-limited-ability-to-publicly-fight-this\n\nAsked by a faculty member what he and his peers could do to help, the University of Iowa’s interim vice president for research suggested only “acting as a private citizen to call our legislators and tell them what a bad idea this is (from your own phone or using your own email).” The campus’s location in a solidly red state hindered it from fighting the policy change, Lois J. Geist seemed to imply in her reply. “Being located where we are we have limited ability to publicly fight this as faculty or as an institution.”"

But the university is also pursuing cuts of 7 percent.\n\n(See attempts to soften here:\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/u-of-minnesota-tries-to-soften-the-blow-of-tuition-hikes-budget-cuts-with-faculty-benefits )\n\nTo manage the financial pressures, school leaders said they “anticipate involuntary reductions in head count.”\n\n\nBut Dr. Mitchell, the American Council on Education president, and a former president of Occidental College, emphasized the range of schools that were facing financial headwinds.\n\n\n“This isn’t just the Ivies, and this just isn’t the result of headline freezes on big research projects,” he said. “This reflects more uncertainty in the basic economy.”"

    "text": "The Handwriting Revolution\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/curriculum/2025/06/17/amid-ai-plagiarism-more-professors-turn-handwritten-work\n\nFive semesters after ChatGPT changed education forever, some professors are taking their classes back to the pre-internet era.\n\n\nSo now, Ryckman is switching things up. Starting next semester, she’s planning to have her students write their responses in class to deter the use of AI—and she’s even considering requiring them to write the answers out by hand.\n\n\nYour Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1\n\nWith today’s wide adoption of LLM products like ChatGPT from OpenAI, humans and businesses engage and use LLMs on a daily basis. Like any other tool, it carries its own set of advantages and limitations. This study focuses on finding out the cognitive cost of using an LLM in the educational context of writing an essay.\n\n\nAs the educational impact of LLM use only begins to settle with the general population, in this study we demonstrate the pressing matter of a likely decrease in learning skills based on the results of our study. The use of LLM had a measurable impact on participants, and while the benefits were initially apparent, as we demonstrated over the course of 4 months, the LLM group’s participants performed worse than their counterparts in the Brain-only group at all levels: neural, linguistic, scoring.\n\n\nWhat Will Be Left of Higher Ed in Four Years?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-will-be-left-of-higher-ed-in-four-years\n\nA recent report from the consulting firm Deloitte confirms what everyone working in higher education already knows: Donald Trump “brings a layer of complexity to questions of financial sustainability for colleges and universities.” The administration’s dizzying range of punitive measures for academe comes at an inconvenient time: Our institutions are already grappling with diminished state support and a looming demographic cliff.\n\n\nResearch universities face the greatest financial pressure. Grant cancellations and planned cuts to the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health are creating enormous budgetary holes: The budgets for graduate programs and scientific-research staffing were developed on the assumption that federal funding was a constant.\n\n\nIn red states like Florida, Indiana, and Texas, Trump-supporting Legislatures are also working to bust up faculty and administrative autonomy as a condition of public funding. The administration’s cultural agenda for higher ed is likely to be advanced most fully in states where MAGA-friendly legislatures have near-total control. This doesn’t mean blue-state public research universities are off the hook. Data shows that state financial support for higher ed has been up over the past couple of years, but we might have reached high tide. Ebbing state funding would pair dangerously with cuts to federal research.\n\n\nRegional Publics and Community Colleges\n\n\nAt first glance these institutions appear to be in an enviable position: They don’t rely heavily on federal research funding, they don’t have big endowments to tax, they don’t enroll lots of international students, and they tend to fly below the political radar. Domestic undergraduate enrollment is unlikely to collapse, and a looming economic downturn could even cause an uptick in demand for these institutions since people look to increase their skills and retrain during recessions. Still, the major financial-aid reform provisions tucked away in the “Big, Beautiful” reconciliation bill recently passed by the House will clearly affect these institutions if enacted, though in mixed ways. For community colleges, their lower tuition prices, shorter program duration, and a vocational orientation might yield comparative advantages in a world with diminished federal student aid. Risk-sharing provisions that put campuses on the hook for portions of unpaid student debt might harm minority-serving institutions and campuses that serve low-income and other students with historically higher rates of loan default. Requiring full-time enrollment for Pell Grant eligibility, as proposed in the House bill, would harm these institutions too. The Senate seems less excited about the risk-sharing and full-time Pell provisions, but the financial-aid outlook remains murky.\n\n\nRegional universities and community colleges also face enrollment risks. Pennsylvania State University plans to shutter several regional campuses, and federal pressure on research universities will have knock-on effects within state university systems. Looking to secure their own budgets, research universities might employ aggressive tactics to lure students otherwise headed to regional campuses.\n\n\nRather than forming partnerships with the federal government, colleges will now have to endure the headwinds created by federal policy and, in some cases, engage in direct confrontation with the administration. I do not believe Trump will be able to destroy American higher education, but his administration will try, and the sector will suffer. Research footprints will shrink, the number of programs and activities on offer will be reduced, and the workloads of already-overextended faculty and staff will increase. Senior administrators can’t say so, but in the next few years colleges and universities will become diminished versions of themselves. Those of us who teach or work in higher ed will watch our institutions decline.\n\n\nCampuses will look for revenue to replace federal dollars. Public research universities will increase their enrollments, often at the expense of their regional counterparts. Our wealthiest colleges may quietly roll back their need-blind admissions policies. The steady trickle of emails from university communications announcing exciting new cancer research efforts and new science facilities will slow. Departmental budgets will be slashed to the point where faculty concern is less for vanishing tenure lines than for the survival of the department itself. Teaching course loads will grow, library operational hours will shrink, and students, stung by loan restrictions and red tape, will increasingly rush from class to part-time jobs. In short, the sector will be smaller, poorer, and capable of doing fewer things."

The administration has paused $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania amid an investigation into its athletics policies. And it temporarily paused more than $100 million in funding to the University of Maine system after the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, said she would not observe the president’s executive order on transgender athletes, which does not carry the force of law.\n\n\nNYTimes: Professors Pushed Harvard to Resist Trump.

On the first full day of the Trump presidency, the university announced it was adopting a highly debated definition of antisemitism — which labels certain criticisms of Israel, such as calling its existence racist, as antisemitic — a move encouraged by the new administration but slammed by free speech advocates.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Pauses Dozens of Federal Grants to Princeton\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/trump-federal-grants-princeton.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration moved this week to suspend dozens of federal grants to Princeton University, the fourth Ivy League school that has seen its financial support from Washington reduced or explicitly threatened since March.\n\n\nAccording to Princeton’s most recent financial report, the university received more than $455 million through government grants and contracts during the fiscal year that ended in June 2024. That money accounted for roughly 18 percent of the university’s revenues.\n\n\nWho Is on Trump’s Antisemitism Task Force?\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/02/who-trumps-antisemitism-task-force?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed&utm_campaign=d776e1ff03-DNU_2021_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1fcbc04421-d776e1ff03-197464749&mc_cid=d776e1ff03&mc_eid=50634a26f0\n\nStaff and Funding Cuts at the NEH Loom\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/03/staff-and-funding-cuts-neh-loom\n\nHumanities advocates don’t know exactly how large the cuts to NEH’s approximately 180-person staff or $78.25 million grant budget will be, but they note that “patterns at other agencies” provide a solid hint.

The administration has paused $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania amid an investigation into its athletics policies. And it temporarily paused more than $100 million in funding to the University of Maine system after the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, said she would not observe the president’s executive order on transgender athletes, which does not carry the force of law.\n\n\nNYTimes: Professors Pushed Harvard to Resist Trump. Now Billions Are on the Line.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/republicans-harvard-funding.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(NY Times blaming the victims in the headline…again)\n\n“The sharks circle when they smell blood in the water,” said Kenneth Roth, a former director of Human Rights Watch and a fellow at Harvard, who wants Harvard to fight better to allow robust debate and academic freedom.\n\n\n“That every-man-for-themselves response is about to cost us our democracy,” said Dr. Levitsky, who studies authoritarian regimes.\n\n\nAs President Trump’s inauguration approached, Harvard hired Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep ties to Mr. Trump. On the first full day of the Trump presidency, the university announced it was adopting a highly debated definition of antisemitism — which labels certain criticisms of Israel, such as calling its existence racist, as antisemitic — a move encouraged by the new administration but slammed by free speech advocates.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Pauses Dozens of Federal Grants to Princeton\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/trump-federal-grants-princeton.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration moved this week to suspend dozens of federal grants to Princeton University, the fourth Ivy League school that has seen its financial support from Washington reduced or explicitly threatened since March.\n\n\nAccording to Princeton’s most recent financial report, the university received more than $455 million through government grants and contracts during the fiscal year that ended in June 2024.

The rope-a-dope is meant to tire people out for a counter attack, and the latter wasn’t the intent. I felt there were more than a few missed opportunities:\n\nI thought Stefanik’s questioning on Abda had such a faulty premise – she had worked at CAIR so shouldn’t be employable – needed some push back. There was not a hint of suggestion that her work for CUNY has been problematic or compromised, yet people should be fired. Plus, the NYT reported her characterization of CAIR is wholly unfounded.\nHer question about CUNY clear was so poorly framed as to require a reprimand by the ranking member in his closing – people accused deserve representation and the egregious examples of this particular case are so bad something could have been said beyond they choose their own cases.\nThe Hunter College questions involved showing someone’s email–doxxing–and was essentially a call for punishment for involving the police in a police matter. [thanks EI]\nThe questions about Jewish Faculty being represented by the PSC from one congressman who tried to get the Chancellor to admit it was unfair could have had much more pushback – this case was appealed to the supreme court which declined to hear it. Basically this congressman was asking the Chancellor to go against several judge’s opinions. Maybe pointing that out shows the ridiculousness of this and other questions.\nThe PSC positions were mis-characterized; the PSC Chair was personally dragged and mis-characterized–the rope-a-dope that the union is an independent group could have been turned into a counterattack to the assault on faculty unions in general.\n\nIf any good came out of this, hopefully it will be the republican majority realizing these hearings have totally lost their potency. Maybe the reporting next time will pick up the consistent message of the democrats that these aren’t seriously trying to understand a problem.)\n\n3 College Presidents Went to Congress.

Davis, slammed Republicans’ “attempt to smear CUNY and our union as antisemitic.”\n\n\n“We do not accept the false premise that underlies today’s hearing that any campus activism in support of the Palestinian people is antisemitic, if not criminal,” Davis wrote. “As a union, we do not have a position on BDS and do not have Israel divestment policies.”\n\n\n3 More Campus Leaders Face Congress\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/16/3-more-campus-leaders-face-congress\n\nFor the fifth time since late 2023, congressional Republicans on Tuesday interrogated a group of university leaders about campus antisemitism. But unlike previous hearings, this one was short on fireworks and viral moments\n\n\nHouse Republicans Grill CUNY Chief on Campus Antisemitism Claims\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/07/15/cuny-felix-matos-rodriguez-antisemitism-house-elise-stefanik/\n(Grill was the headline choice of many others, mostly the slanted right side of reporting)\n\nSome of the toughest questioning of Matos Rodríguez again came from Stefanik, an ally of President Donald Trump who is reportedly considering a run for governor in New York after the president withdrew her nomination to be U.N. Ambassador to protect Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\n\nPSC president Davis then went on to decry what he saw as a clamp down on free speech across the university campuses.\n\n\n“CUNY administrators have investigated faculty for the terms in which they discuss the war in Gaza in their classes, limited the time, place, and manner for exercising the right to free expression on campus, invited police violence against non-violent student protestors, and even fired faculty in apparent retribution for their political activism,” Davis said. “It is still not enough to satisfy the new McCarthyites. Universities must stand against fascism, not accommodate it.”\n\n\nNYTimes: University Leaders Reject Republican Attacks on Campus Antisemitism\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/us/politics/antisemitism-hearing-uc-berkeley-georgetown-cuny.html\n\nOn Tuesday, Republicans accused the university leaders of fostering an antisemitic climate and failing to rein in professors and students the lawmakers said were antisemitic. Democrats on the committee argued the hearing was part of a crackdown on speech that attempted to scapegoat academia for a broader societal problem.\n\n\nThe university leaders, meanwhile, seemed to have learned from the past. They attempted, with apparent success, to avoid the kinds of viral moments that have characterized previous antisemitism hearings and brought down other university presidents.\n\n\nShe [Stefanik] attacked CUNY for hiring a former employee of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights organization, inaccurately suggesting that CAIR had been a “co-conspirator in a terrorist financing case.” (The group was listed as an “unindicted co-conspirator or joint venturer” in a case against a charity, the Holy Land Foundation, along with more than 200 other groups and individuals. It was not accused of a crime.)\n\n\nResponding to Ms. Stefanik’s attacks on Tuesday, CAIR’s national deputy director, Edward Ahmed Mitchell, said the “spirit of Joseph McCarthy is alive and well.” “Representing Mahmoud Khalil and others targeted by the government because they advocated for Palestinian rights is not only our prerogative as lawyers at CLEAR,” said Mr. Kassem, the CUNY law professor who founded the legal clinic, “it is also our pride and privilege.”\n\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik skewers CUNY chancellor, calls for his ouster over ‘failed’ leadership on NYC campus antisemitism\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2025/07/15/us-news/rep-elise-stefanik-skewers-cuny-chancellor-calls-for-his-ouster-over-failed-leadership-on-nyc-campus-antisemitism/\n(Cuz why? don’t ask – CUNY hired someone she didn’t like who in several years has no complaints mentioned about her work; lawyers represent people before they are proven not guilty or guilty?)\n\nThe Republican congresswoman zeroed in on Chancellor Félix Matos Rodríguez over the hiring of a chief diversity officer who previously worked for a pro-Hamas, Israel-bashing group — saying that if the CUNY boss doesn’t step down, Gov. Kathy Hochul should bounce him.\n\n\nStefanik also asked Matos Rodríguez if he knew that law professor Ramzi Kassem, the head of CUNY Law School’s legal clinic, Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility or CLEAR, was representing Mahmoud Khalil, the anti-Israel Columbia University protester who was detained by the Trump administration.\n\n\nIn a joint press conference after the hearing with Brooklyn Councilwoman Inna Vernikov in DC, Stefanik said Matos Rodríguez had to go, and claimed Hochul was part of the problem.\n\n(Just testing their powers; doubt either was packing today, but can’t vouch for that on other days.)\n(And what is wrong with the Post?

Observers wondered whether it was the start of another lengthy, destructive American war in the Middle East.\n\n\nHours later, a conservative social media account with more than 4.3 million followers highlighted one response—allegedly from a Georgetown University professor. According to a screenshot the Libs of TikTok X account posted, Jonathan Brown, the Alwaleed bin Talal Chair of Islamic Civilization, had written on X, “I hope Iran does some symbolic strike on a base, then everyone stops.”\n\n\nWhat transpired is becoming a familiar story in U.S. higher education: Conservatives denounce a faculty member’s speech, members of Congress join in and eventually pressure a prestigious university’s president to publicly denounce and punish the scholar.\n\n\nGreg Afinogenov, an associate history professor and president of Georgetown’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said Brown has received “death threats, his family has come under attack and members of the university administration have also criticized him and disavowed him.”\n\n\nAfinogenov said the university should clarify that Brown’s post was “protected speech.”\n\n\n“This procedure of hauling members of university administrations before” a “congressional kangaroo court” harms academic freedom, he said. Administrators should push back against these “smear campaigns,” and Georgetown should articulate a policy to protect faculty and other members of the university community from retaliation for their “extramural speech,” such as on social media, he said.\n\n\nCongress attacked CUNY on falsehoods\n\nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/18/congress-attacked-cuny-on-falsehoods/\n(PSC Chair has this op-ed)\n\nPlease, provide an email to continue reading this article for free.

It’s an America defined pretty narrowly on racial, ethnic and religious terms. It’s an America that has a certain understanding of its history that aligns with those dominant religious, racial and ethnic groups. It’s an America that has doubled down on masculinity as its defining gender in terms of who should be in power and have power in public life. So when we talk about a vision for higher ed, it’s a higher ed that serves that.\n\n\nThis is what you see in these very vague pronouncements about things like DEI. Anyone who educates or does research on anything that runs counter to that celebration of a very particularistic America is suspect and un-American. Higher ed is part of a whole set of knowledge-producing institutions in society—we can think about journalists and scientists, too— as being problematic because they serve accountability functions. They hold corporations responsible for things like polluting. They hold executives responsible for violations of democratic norms. Or, you know, they hold people in power accountable for not being good custodians of public trust. I think the administration wants to weaken that accountability function that can be played by universities because it undermines, ultimately, their ability to exercise power in the service of that larger vision of what they believe America should be.\n\n\nQ: You mentioned vague pronouncements about things like DEI. What conclusions do you draw from this tactic of sowing confusion and using unclear and undefined language?\n\n\nA: Ultimately, the end goal is control. They have a few tools to do so—legal means, regulatory means—and they have a lot of funding means to get institutions that are otherwise autonomous in civil society to comply with what they want them to do. But in the absence of those levers, what do you use? Well, you use publicity to get willing compliance or anticipatory compliance.\n\n\nWhy Universities Are So Powerless in Their Fight Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/why-universities-are-so-powerless-in-their-fight-against-trump\n\nThe administration’s moves to slash federal funding are just one part of a concerted effort to force major research universities to change how they pursue their core missions. And yet the sector’s most full-throated response — an American Association of Colleges and Universities statement signed by over 600 academic leaders — makes only vague reference to “constructive reform” while rejecting coercive uses of public funding. Widely adopted faculty resolutions calling for mutual-defense pacts amount to little more than suggestions that have yet to bear fruit. The most successful instances of collective resistance to date are four lawsuits challenging agency indirect-cost policies. By my count, 23 universities have joined at least one of those suits.\n\n\nA decentralized organizational structure puts resources and decision-making authority nearer to the ground, allowing different units of the university to prioritize the things their work requires. Faculties in business, social work, or law can make curricular, hiring, and promotion decisions largely independent of each other and of colleagues in arts and sciences, each tuning their activities to their specific needs, goals, and vision. Decentralization also explains why universities rarely articulate detailed, actionable principles that unequivocally guide institutionwide decision-making — or at least why, when they do proffer strategic plans or mission statements, the results are often anodyne.\n\n\nUniversities are organized to hold contradictions, not to resolve them. Typical academic decision-making processes manage the ambiguities that multiple goals create in lieu of picking winners in the underlying conflicts. That works well in normal times, but it is disastrously bad for reaching, communicating, and acting on common priorities under threat. Yet universities’ public missions may now require them to do just that.\n\n\nProminent conservatives generally agree that hardball tactics are necessary to compel desired changes in academe. JD Vance advocated for “honestly and aggressively” attacking universities. Leo Terrell, who heads the Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, wants financial pressures “to bring these universities to their knees.” As the conservative commentator Heather Mac Donald puts it: “The concept of academic freedom should be scaled back to allow funders — especially taxpayers — a say in how universities are run, including in what is taught.” The activist Christopher F. Rufo believes “existential terror” will provide the leverage needed to make an ultimatum stick: “Reform, or lose billions in funding.” That threat is now being carried out, and the administration’s will to back it up has been on clear display. As Robert Kelchen put it, “Every revenue source is at risk.” Federal research grants and contracts are just the beginning.\n\n\nThe Columbia example shows that the decisions institutions targeted by the Trump administration face have far-reaching, complex implications that take them far outside the standard mechanisms of academic leadership. The most easily defensible choice for any institution may be to protect its interests by negotiating for the best individual deal. But, as one Harvard professor pointed out, “that might be quite bad for higher education as a whole.”\n\n\nThe Harvard case has, so far, revealed this administration’s willingness to flip every policy lever available to them to reshape universities. It suggests a more complex landscape and more wrenching decisions are in store — choices that will certainly pit a university against itself, further fragmenting and undermining coordinated responses.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Winning the Race to the Bottom\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/opinion/trump-america-china.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nPopulists are anti-intellectual. President Trump isn’t pumping research money into the universities; he’s draining it out. The administration is not tripling the National Science Foundation’s budget; it’s trying to gut it. The administration is trying to cut all federal basic research funding by a third, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. A survey by the journal Nature of 1,600 scientists in the United States found that three-quarters of them have considered leaving the country.\n\n\nAmerica’s leaders understood that a superpower rivalry is as much an intellectual contest as a military and economic one. It’s who can out-innovate whom. So they fought the Soviet threat with education, with the goal of maximizing talent on our side.\n\n\n“One reason the U.S. economy had such a good Cold War was that the American university had an ever better one,” the historian Hal Brands writes in his book “The Twilight Struggle.” Federal support for academic research rose to $1.45 billion in 1970 from $254 million in 1958. Earlier in that century, American universities lagged behind their “best” European peers, Brands observes; by the end of the Cold War, they dominated the globe.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Report on the State of Academic Governance in Community Colleges\n\n(Thanks to JC and VAC)\nhttps://www.aaup.org/news/new-report-state-academic-governance-community-colleges\n\nAt most responding institutions, and especially at responding institutions with tenure systems, faculty authority is consistent with AAUP-recommended governance standards in decision-making about programmatic, departmental, and institutional curricula; teaching assignments; salary policies; and faculty searches, evaluations, and tenure and promotion standards.\n\n\nHowever, in several decision-making areas, including budgets, buildings, provost selection, and strategic planning, community college faculty have few meaningful opportunities to participate. In these areas, community colleges deviate from the principles set forth in the AAUP’s 1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities, which emphasizes faculty involvement in personnel decisions and budget preparation.\n\n\nStatistically significant differences in the level of faculty authority between unionized and nonunionized colleges appear in only three of the twenty-six areas, a finding that mirrors that in the AAUP’s 2021 Shared Governance Survey of four-year institutions. Specifically, institutions where the faculty engages in collective bargaining have higher levels of faculty authority in areas related to salary policies teaching loads, and, in the case of community colleges, full-time non-tenure-track faculty promotion decisions.\n\n\nAcross most areas of academic and personnel decision-making, levels of faculty authority are lower at community colleges than at four-year institutions. However, faculty members at community colleges have more involvement in salary policies than those at four-year institutions; the difference is likely related to the higher prevalence of institutions with collective bargaining in the community college sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas just gutted free speech on college campuses. Is your state next?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/07/14/texas-campus-free-speech/\n\nAcross the country, state legislators have been racing to exert new influence over free expression in higher education. Now, Texas has surged to the forefront, closing its 2025 legislative session by passing two alarming laws that take effect Sept. 1.\n\n\nthe new laws amount to a stunningly aggressive legislative crackdown on campus protest (S.B. 2972) and academic shared governance (S.B. 37) at public colleges and universities. The laws will not just silence dissent and undermine faculty authority in Texas; they provide a blueprint for how to dismantle academic freedom and chill speech on campus state by state.\n\n\nNow, some of the same legislators have done an about-face. The campus protest law actually directs public colleges and universities to implement a version of free-speech zones and adopt sweeping limitations on protests. Encampments? Banned. Megaphones or speakers during “class hours”? Forbidden — if anyone claims your “expressive activity” is one that “intimidates others” or “interferes” with an employee’s duties. Even wearing a mask during a protest — something many do for safety — could land a student or employee a disciplinary hearing resulting in “sanctions.” And any expressive activity between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. is off-limits altogether.\n\n\nState law defines “expressive activity” as “any speech or expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment” — speeches, writing, art, symbolic actions, even just talking to your friends. It’s problematic enough that legislators seek to prohibit nighttime or early-morning protest activity, but the language could affect late-night art events, student journalists, and even assigned research, course or thesis work for students or faculty in the habit of burning the midnight oil. The new law is so absurdly broad it could theoretically be used to stop a group of students from discussing politics on a campus bench at night. That’s not security; it’s suppression.\n\n\nAnd this is just half the story.\n\n\nThe second new law in Texas is an outright power grab dismantling shared governance, the cornerstone of U.S. higher education. Typically, higher education institutions have democratic systems to share power and foster collaboration among administrators, governing boards and faculty. Faculty senates, whose members are typically elected by faculty, exercise authority over curricular matters, academic policies and graduation requirements. In addition, they often play a role in general institutional decisions, such as related to planning, budgeting or the evaluation of administrators.\n\n\nThe Texas legislature obliterates these traditions, stripping faculty of any meaningful decision-making role in how their institutions are run. Under this law, faculty senates at public universities and colleges can now exist only if permitted by the institutions’ governing boards — the oversight bodies whose members are politically appointed by the state governor. In mockery of democratic principles, half of the faculty senate members must be chosen by the university president, and administrators can remove faculty for not conducting their duties within vague “senate parameters.”\n\n\nTo make matters worse, the law installs a governor-appointed “ombudsman” with sweeping enforcement powers. This political appointee will be charged with monitoring compliance with state laws and can recommend that a public university or college lose all state funding unless it complies.\n\n\n\n\nTech billionaire Trump adviser Marc Andreesen says universities will ‘pay the price’ for DEI\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/07/12/marc-andreessen-private-chat-universities-diversity/\n\nThe investor described a “counterattack” against universities in his messages and called for the National Science Foundation, a federal research funding agency, to receive “the bureaucratic death penalty.”\n\n\n“The universities are at Ground Zero of the counterattack” from Trump voters, Andreessen wrote, alleging colleges favored immigrants over Americans and promoted DEI, or diversity, equity, and inclusion policies intended to increase race and gender representation.\n\n\n“The combination of DEI and immigration is politically lethal,” Andreessen wrote. “When these two forms of discrimination combine, as they have for the last 60 years and on hyperdrive for the last decade, they systematically cut most of the children of the Trump voter base out of any realistic prospect of access to higher education and corporate America.”\n\n(Yeah, right)\n\n\nNYTimes: Inside the Conservative Campaign That Took Down the U.Va.

Ryan, for his robust promotion of campus diversity initiatives.\n\n\nThe Justice Department then hired a lawyer to help enforce those orders at the Office of Civil Rights: Gregory W. Brown, a University of Virginia alumnus and donor.\n\n\nThe Jefferson Council and the Office of Civil Rights separately denied in interviews that they had worked in concert. But the council had at least set the table for what came next. And in his new position, Mr. Brown helped engineer an unusual and concerted pressure campaign that would lead to Mr. Ryan’s resignation.\n\n\nAnd in his new position, Mr. Brown helped engineer an unusual and concerted pressure campaign that would lead to Mr. Ryan’s resignation.\n\n\nThat campaign showed just how far the Office of Civil Rights — which had for decades been at the center of the fight for racial equality — would go to take on universities that it views as hostile to its new agenda. By issuing a stream of demands and threats, the office essentially sped past the university board, appointed by the governor, that has oversight of its flagship public university.\n\n\n“What the Justice Department did was very similar to what President Eisenhower did,” Mr. Gardner [the Jefferson Council president] said, comparing the Trump administration’s actions to the 1957 White House decision to dispatch troops to Little Rock, Ark., to enforce the Supreme Court’s school desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education.\n\n(Uhh…)\n\nThere were other requests [In addition to the 7 letters].

The coalition sees its plan as a middle ground, one that responds to long-held gripes about how indirect costs are administered while lessening the billions in lost revenue for universities under the 15-percent indirect-cost cap proposed by several federal agencies, among them the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Departments of Defense and Energy.\n\n\nThe plan’s true effect on how much universities would receive for indirect costs is unclear. H. Holden Thorp, editor in chief of the Science family of journals and a former university chancellor, who is not part of JAG but has reviewed the proposal, said such a fundamental change to how universities balance their research budgets will be costly. The amount of funding received under the FAIR model “absolutely will be less,” he said, but “it won’t be as bad as it was going to be” under the Trump administration’s proposed 15-percent cap.\n\n\n\n\nHouse Appropriators Propose 23% Cut to NSF\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/15/house-appropriators-propose-23-cut-nsf\n\nHouse Republicans want to cut the National Science Foundation’s funding by about $2 billion, according to budget documents released Monday.\n\n\nStill, funding for NSF is already one point of disagreement between House and Senate appropriators. Last week, Senate Republicans indicated that they would cut only about $16 million from NSF, leaving the agency with just over $9 billion.\n\n\nThe House plan, which would give NSF about $7 billion, is just a proposal and doesn’t go as far as President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026, which cuts more than $5 billion from the agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Live Updates: Supreme Court Clears Way for Dismantling of Education Department\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/07/14/us/trump-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe order is a significant victory for the administration and could ease President Trump’s efforts to sharply curtail the federal government’s role in the nation’s schools.\n\n\nIt also represents an expansion of presidential power, allowing Mr. Trump to functionally eliminate a government department created by Congress, without legislators’ input.\n\n\nIt comes after a decision by the justices last week that cleared the way for the Trump administration to move forward with cutting thousands of jobs across a number of federal agencies, including the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, State and Treasury.\n\n\nThe order by the court was unsigned and gave no reasoning, as is typical in such emergency applications. No vote count was given, which is usual for emergency orders, but Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissent, joined by the court’s other two liberals, Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\n\nThe order is technically temporary, applying while appeals proceed through the courts. In practice, thousands of fired workers whom a Boston judge had ordered be reinstated are now again subject to removal from their jobs.\n\n(Sotamayor)\n\nThe President must take care that the laws are faithfully executed, not set out to dismantle them.

In a similar vein, Texas passed a law going after academic minors and certificate programs with low enrollments. It worries faculty and scholarly groups, who stress that the number of majors in a program isn’t the only or best way to gauge its worth.\n\n\n“Campuses are forced to respond to legislative mandates that have arisen from a narrow understanding of what higher education is,” said Paula Krebs, executive director of the Modern Language Association. Students who pursue public higher education will be “getting a reduced version of what a degree should be,” she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: How Trump’s crackdown on universities is affecting the world\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/07/13/us/2025-06-06-int-science-reaction-index.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUniversities are an easy target for right-wing populists. Polls show that a lot of Americans consider them too liberal, too expensive and too elitist, and not entirely without reason.\n\n(Why the lede needs to add that last bit is beyond me…)\n\nToday, the biggest beneficiary could be China and Chinese universities, which have been trying to recruit world-class scientific talent for years. Now Mr. Trump is doing their work for them. One indication of the success of China’s campaign to attract the best and brightest is Africa, the world’s youngest continent. Africans are learning Mandarin in growing numbers. Nearly twice as many study in China as in America.\n\n\nCould America gamble away its scientific supremacy in the service of ideology? It has happened before. Under the Nazis, Germany lost its scientific edge to America in the space of a few years. As a German, my brain may wander too readily to the lessons of the 1930s, but in this case the analogy feels instructive. Several of my colleagues covering the fallout from the crackdown on international students and researchers pointed to Hitler’s silencing of scientists and intellectuals.\n\n\nI don’t sense a big change in the mood in India yet. The United States still holds a lot of soft power and remains very attractive to Indians. In fact, many Indians are seeing something that is pretty familiar to them. They’re saying, “Welcome to the world as we have experienced it for the past few years.” The government under Narendra Modi has definitely cracked down on free speech. It has tried to quash dissenting voices, and it has also leaned on academics and has tried to squeeze certain research institutions that it considers too liberal. And there has been a demonization of the Muslim minority, which make up about 15 percent of the population. There are a lot of similarities to Trump’s America. Everyone in the world is just trying to understand what Trump’s actions mean for their own countries. So India’s experience can be instructive in making sense of this moment. [Anupreeta Das is a South Asia correspondent for the Times,]\n\n\nChina really wants to become a center for international education, because it sees that as a key ingredient for building its reputation as a global superpower. American universities have long been a source of American soft power. China wants Chinese universities to be a source of Chinese soft power. And now Trump is doing their work for them. You can see that in China’s rhetoric and messaging. It’s trying to portray itself as open and international, everything that the Trump administration is turning away from. [Vivian Wang is a correspondent for the Times in Beijing]\n\n\n\n\nTrump wields his ‘secret weapon’: College accreditation\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/12/trump-college-accreditation-political-influence/\n(“his” What about just saying weaponizing …)\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his allies are using a little-known but powerful corner of higher education — college accreditation — to exert pressure on colleges and universities, an effort that threatens the independence of accreditors and the stability of the institutions they approve.\n\n\nThis week, the Education and Health and Human Services departments encouraged Harvard University’s accreditor to take action against the Ivy League school for allegedly violating the civil rights of Jewish students. The New England Commission of Higher Education, which accredits Harvard, said it has given the university until Aug. 15 to respond and will take up the matter at a previously scheduled meeting in September.\n\n\nThe administration took a similar step in early June over Columbia University’s alleged civil rights violations. By the end of June, Columbia’s accreditor, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, issued the school a noncompliance warning. Middle States did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n“It’s unusual for [the Office of Civil Rights] to directly involve itself in accrediting matters,” said John R. Przypyszny, a lawyer who specializes in accreditation.\n\n\nWhile the Trump administration has no direct control over whether the schools remain accredited, it could punish accreditors for failing to act by stripping them of the authority needed to operate. And a recent move by the Education Department is raising questions about whether the administration is dangling that possibility over Harvard and Columbia’s accreditors.\n\n\nA day after notifying Columbia’s accreditor of the Ivy League school’s alleged violations in June, the Education Department postponed a meeting of the federal advisory committee that oversees accreditors from July to October. The 18-member committee was scheduled to vote this summer on whether Middle States and the New England Commission should remain certified to accredit colleges.\n\n\nBy the time the committee meets this fall, the terms of six of its members will have expired. The House, Senate and education secretary take turns appointing members, and this time the secretary will fill all six seats. That gives the Trump administration a chance to select people who are aligned with its ideology on higher education.\n\n\n“It seems like they’re trying to fix the vote,” said Robert Shireman, a member of the committee who is also a senior fellow at the left-leaning Century Foundation.\n\n\nSeveral committee members said the Education Department flouted the rules of the panel, which says only the chair can set a meeting schedule. When Zakiya Smith Ellis, who assumed the role of chair in February, pointed that out, she said the department told her it did not recognize her as chair because she took over the position when the previous chair resigned.\n\n\nDespite Reservations, Florida Approves New Accreditor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/state-policy/2025/07/11/despite-reservations-florida-bog-approves-new-accreditor\n\nThe decision came after about an hour of heated discussion between board members and the State University System of Florida’s chancellor regarding details of the plan.\n\n\nChancellor Raymond Rodriguez argued that the new accreditor, called the Commission for Public Higher Education, would eliminate the bureaucracy that comes with existing accrediting agencies and focus specifically on the needs of public universities.\n\n\n“The Commission for Public Higher Education will offer an accreditation model that prioritizes academic excellence and student success while removing ideological bias and unnecessary financial burdens,” he said. “Through the CPHE, public colleges and universities across the country will have access to an accreditation process that is focused on quality, rooted in accountability and committed to continuous improvement.”\n\n\nBut before voting in favor of the motion, board members repeatedly pushed back, arguing that the plans for starting an accreditor from scratch were half-baked.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: As Harvard and Trump Head to Court, the Government Piles on the Pressure\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/us/harvard-trump-head-to-trial.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement served subpoenas to Harvard with sprawling demands that included payroll records, years of disciplinary files and any videos Harvard had of international students protesting on campus since 2020, according to two people familiar with the subpoenas, some of which were reviewed by The New York Times. The agency gave the university a breakneck one-week deadline for compliance.\n\n\nAlso this month, the administration formally accused the school of civil rights violations, arguing that Harvard had failed to protect Jewish people on campus. The government also complained to the university’s accreditor, which could eventually jeopardize Harvard students’ access to federal financial aid.\n\n\nHarvard leaders are well aware that a long fight with the government is perilous, threatening jobs, projects, reputations and academic independence. Some inside the university have feared that civil inquiries could become criminal matters.\n\n\nBefore the lawsuit, the administration sent Harvard an extraordinary list of conditions, including new policies on hiring, admissions and faculty influence, compulsory reports to the government and audits of academic programs and departments. Since then, although officials acknowledged that sending the letter was a mistake, the government has barely budged from the demands.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia and Trump Near a Deal, With School Possibly Paying Millions\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/11/nyregion/columbia-university-trump-deal-antisemitism.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe existence of a potential deal was confirmed by a third person, who, like the others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive negotiations.\n\n(Methinks this may be a planted story to put pressure on Columbia, but what do I know.)\n\nA university spokeswoman on Friday night did not confirm details of the deal or the potential White House meeting. “The university is focused on advancing the discussions with the federal government. There is no resolution at this time,” the spokeswoman, Virginia Lam Abrams, said.\n\n\nThe deal could include $200 million or more in compensation paid by Columbia for alleged civil rights violations. Columbia officials are expected to meet with Trump aides next week at the White House to finalize the deal, said one of the people familiar with the discussions.\n\n\nAnd Harvard, despite its litigation, has also restarted talks with the Trump administration regarding the return of billions of dollars in federal research funding that have been cut.\n\n\nThe current draft of the deal, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and The Free Beacon, does not go as far in exerting federal authority over the university as an earlier version that was circulated in April.\n\n\nThe negotiations with Columbia have been directed out of the White House by a team led by a Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, with additional involvement of an interagency task force on antisemitism.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-columbia-civil-rights-settlement-86f64531\nhttps://freebeacon.com/campus/columbia-nears-deal-with-trump-administration-university-will-pay-discrimination-victims-reveal-more-admissions-and-hiring-data-but-will-dodge-harsher-measures-like-governance-shakeup/\n(From Wikipedia “The New York Times credited the Free Beacon with breaking, together with Chris Rufo,[23] and subsequently expanding, reportage on the plagiarism accusations against Harvard President Claudine Gay” which is about the nicest way to say they made mountains out of mole hills)\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Expands Efforts to Fight Antisemitism as Trump Deal Seems Near\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/nyregion/columbia-plan-to-fight-antisemitism.html\n\nMs. Shipman announced that the changes would include formally incorporating the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism into the work of a recently established office at Columbia that considers complaints of discrimination and discriminatory harassment.\n\n\nIn addition, Columbia will appoint two new coordinators to oversee investigations into claims of discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Those coordinators will produce a publicly available report each year about discrimination investigations and their results.\n\n\nThe university will also institute new educational programs about antisemitism for students and faculty and staff members, including those developed by national organizations such as Project Shema, a training and support organization, and the Anti-Defamation League. And it will reaffirm that it has zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment based on protected traits, including Jewish and Israeli identity.\n\n\nJoseph Howley, a professor of classics and supporter of the pro-Palestinian movement on campus, was critical for different reasons. The definition of antisemitism being adopted by the university, he said, “is not informed by scholarly expertise or even best practice. So it’s not the best framework for confronting hate speech, and it’s not going to solve real problems of discrimination or harassment.”\n\n\nAnti-Semitism Gets the DEI Treatment - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/columbia-anti-semitism-trump/683586/\n\nTo do the same thing over and over and expect a different result is one definition of insanity. According to Robert Shibley, a special counsel of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), it’s also Columbia University’s approach to addressing anti-Semitism on campus.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Claire Shipman, Columbia’s acting president, announced in an email to the community that the university would take several steps to quell anti-Semitism on campus. Columbia will appoint Title VI and Title VII coordinators to review allegations of discrimination. It will launch new programming around anti-Jewish discrimination, send out regular messages affirming its zero-tolerance policy on hate, and use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of anti-Semitism for certain disciplinary proceedings. In her message, Shipman promised that the university would continue making reforms until it had stamped out anti-Semitism. “In a recent discussion, a faculty member and I agreed that anti-Semitism at this institution has existed, perhaps less overtly, for a long while, and the work of dismantling it, especially through education and understanding, will take time,” she wrote.\n\n\nThe message was notable for how closely it resembled the communications that university presidents have previously sent out about other forms of discrimination. Replace the references to “anti-Semitism” with “racism,” and Shipman’s message could practically have been lifted from the statements of summer 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy attack colleges? To open students’ minds or blow up institutions?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/07/16/trump-dei-george-mason-university/\n\nNow, the mission has gone off the rails: The Trump administration is coming for George Mason University, one of Virginia’s largest colleges, which has done more than almost any other campus in the country to become conservative-friendly.\n\n\nSadly, George Mason’s course will likely be determined not by its president or faculty, but by politicians in Richmond and judges in courtrooms. A Fairfax County judge is expected to rule later this month on a move by Democrats in the Virginia Senate to block approval of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s (R) nominees to the school’s board. And when Virginia voters choose a new governor this fall, they will be deciding who gets to nominate board members next year.\n\n\nThere was a time, not long ago, when governance of public universities was a bipartisan effort, devoted to building civic knowledge and advancing the skills of the next generation. Politics and culture wars weren’t the primary focus.\n\n\nwe have unthinking attacks on any and all colleges — another example of government gone wild. Trump campaigned last year on smacking down elite colleges’ “Marxist assault on our American heritage and Western civilization itself.” What’s he delivering, perversely enough, is his own reactionary assault on the institutions that transmit our heritage to the inheritors of our democracy.\n\n\nGeorge Mason President Defends Univ. Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/18/gmu-president-responds-civil-rights-investigation\n\n“I can assure you that George Mason has always operated with a commitment to equality under the law, ever since our inception,” he wrote. ”It is simply the Mason way, and in my experience, it has not discriminated based on race, color, national origin, or otherwise. Our diversity efforts are designed to expand opportunity and build inclusive excellence—not to exclude or advantage any group unlawfully.”\n\n\nHe offered a brief history of Title VI—which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in federally funded programs—and the rest of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Then, without naming any names, he essentially accused the Trump administration of willfully misinterpreting the law.\n\n\n“Today, we are seeing a profound shift in how Title VI is being applied,” he wrote. “Longstanding efforts to address inequality—such as mentoring programs, inclusive hiring practices, and support for historically underrepresented groups—are in many cases being reinterpreted as presumptively unlawful. Broad terms like ‘illegal DEI’ are now used without definition, allowing virtually any initiative that touches on identity or inclusion to be painted as discriminatory.\n\n\nTrump administration expands scrutiny of George Mason University\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/17/george-mason-doj-investigation/\n\nThe investigation [into the alleged use of race in hiring and promotions at George Mason University ] is the third launched by the administration in recent weeks into the policies and practices at the Northern Virginia university, and the first inquiry into the school led by the Justice Department.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs U-Va. president leaves, faculty say board failed to protect university\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/11/university-of-virginia-faculty-board-no-confidence-ryan/\n\nUniversity of Virginia faculty passed a vote of no confidence Friday in the school’s governing body, saying it failed to protect against “outside interference” by the Trump administration that led to the eventual resignation of President James E. Ryan.\n\n\nThe vote by the U-Va. faculty senate — which came on Ryan’s last day in office — called on the board to provide faculty with an “immediate and complete accounting” of its response to inquiries by the Justice Department in recent months.\n\n\nThe board leaders also said the Justice Department investigations were ongoing and that they would work hard to reach a voluntary settlement with the Trump administration as soon as they could.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Hiring: Title VI Coordinators\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/diversity/2025/07/14/colleges-hire-title-vi-coordinators-amid-federal-scrutiny\n\nin fiscal year 2022, before the Israel-Hamas war began, allegations of Title VI violations made up only 17.3 percent of the complaints OCR received, in comparison with Title XI (49.2 percent) and the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 (33.4 percent), which protect against disability discrimination.\n\n\nThe number of Title VI complaints increased 29.4 percent over the next two years. Complaints related to shared ancestry increased sevenfold from 2023 to 2024.\n\n\nIn other cases, it was a proactive step. In April, the State University of New York system, the largest public college system in the nation, required each of its campuses to bring on a Title VI coordinator by fall 2025.\n\n\n“We really have tried to be very thoughtful about ensuring that all of our campuses are safe and supportive environments free from harassment and discrimination. We take Title IX enforcement seriously,” said SUNY chancellor John B. King in an interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina “Will Blow Us Away” if Trump Destroys U.S. Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/07/17/china-will-blow-us-away-if-trump-destroys-us\n\nThe first Nobel Prize–winning scientist to join a White House cabinet, Steven Chu made history when he became Barack Obama’s energy secretary in 2009. But his move to Washington cost him an incredible $300 million.\n\n\n“I joined the Nvidia board in 2004, before the company took off, but I had to sell my shares in 2009 when I joined government,” Chu said about his early involvement in the microchip firm that recently became the world’s most valuable company with a $4 trillion capitalization.\n\n\nSanguine about his lost wealth, Chu’s main takeaway from Nvidia is not his own misfortune. Instead, he worries that this American success story—co-created by a Taiwanese-born Stanford graduate, employing foreign-born engineering talent—might not have been able to happen today given the double whammy faced by U.S. academia: massive cuts to federal science budgets and an immigration crackdown deterring many students, particularly from China, from applying to U.S. institutions.\n\n\nWithout America’s outstanding universities and with its foreign talent pool diminished, China’s path to global dominance will be immeasurably easier, predicted Chu. “Trump is perfectly willing to destroy institutions that any country in the world would give its eyeteeth for,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Happens After A.I. Destroys College Writing?\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/07/the-end-of-the-english-paper\n\nHe opened Claude on his laptop. I noticed a chat that mentioned abolition. “We had to read Robert Wedderburn for a class,” he explained, referring to the nineteenth-century Jamaican abolitionist. “But, obviously, I wasn’t tryin’ to read that.” He had prompted Claude for a summary, but it was too long for him to read in the ten minutes he had before class started. He told me, “I said, ‘Turn it into concise bullet points.’” He then transcribed Claude’s points in his notebook, since his professor ran a screen-free classroom.\n\n\nI teach at a small liberal-arts college, and I often joke that a student is more likely to hand in a big paper a year late (as recently happened) than to take a dishonorable shortcut.\n\n\nThere are no reliable figures for how many American students use A.I., just stories about how everyone is doing it. A 2024 Pew Research Center survey of students between the ages of thirteen and seventeen suggests that a quarter of teens currently use ChatGPT for schoolwork, double the figure from 2023. OpenAI recently released a report claiming that one in three college students uses its products. There’s good reason to believe that these are low estimates.\n\n\nCorey Robin, a writer and a professor of political science at Brooklyn College, read the early stories about ChatGPT with skepticism. Then his daughter, a sophomore in high school at the time, used it to produce an essay that was about as good as those his undergraduates wrote after a semester of work. He decided to stop assigning take-home essays. For the first time in his thirty years of teaching, he administered in-class exams.\n\n\nBarry Lam teaches in the philosophy department at the University of California, Riverside, and hosts a popular podcast, Hi-Phi Nation, which applies philosophical modes of inquiry to everyday topics. He began wondering what it would mean for A.I. to actually be a productivity tool. … If students were learning things faster, then it stood to reason that Lam could assign them “something very hard.” He wanted to test this theory, so for final exams he gave his undergraduates a Ph.D.-level question involving denotative language and the German logician Gottlob Frege which was, frankly, beyond me.\n\n\n“They fucking failed it miserably,” he said. He adjusted his grading curve accordingly.\n\n\nWhen classes were over and students were moving into their summer housing, I e-mailed with Alex, who was settling in in the East Village. He’d just finished his finals, and estimated that he’d spent between thirty minutes and an hour composing two papers for his humanities classes. Without the assistance of Claude, it might have taken him around eight or nine hours. “I didn’t retain anything,” he wrote. “I couldn’t tell you the thesis for either paper hahhahaha.” He received an A-minus and a B-plus. ♦\n\n\nNYTimes: I’m Watching the Sacrifice of College’s Soul\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/opinion/college-soul-ai-education.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAnd perhaps a certain idea of college — a certain ideal of college — is dying. I [Frank Bruni] keep coming back to that possibility, which seems more like a probability since President Trump returned to the White House and began his assault on higher education.\n\n\nWhat happened to college as a theater of intellectual betterment, character development, self-discovery? Easy A’s work against that, replacing rigor with ready affirmation. A.I. also works against that: Why spend hour upon hour synthesizing knowledge when a few keystrokes will do the trick? And measuring schools by their financial return on students’ investments … occludes higher education’s other important functions. Colleges are supposed to nurture nimble thinkers. They’re meant to produce informed and enlightened citizens who are better equipped to leaven passion with reason. There’s a deficit of those now, as ominous as any budgetary shortfall.\n\n\nZimmerman [renowned historian of education at the University of Pennsylvania] said. “We continue to tell a story about the mind-expanding purpose and qualities of a university, and no doubt some people who come here experience that mind expansion. The problem is that all of the other cultural and social signals around them are pointing them in the other direction.”\n\n\nThe moral of those two stories is that the smartest approach to college may be precisely the one that its trajectory of late has conspired against: range widely across subject offerings and focus not on a skill that could become obsolete but on intellectual dexterity and powers of judgment with better odds of enduring relevance. “A liberal arts degree is a preprofessional degree — you just don’t know what the profession is,” said Zimmerman, who teaches a seminar for first-year students at U. Penn. called “Why College?”\n\n\nBut higher education as a blessing independent of any instantly redeemable credential bucks the zeitgeist. Under Trump, blunt materialism reigns, and such concepts as human rights, diplomacy and even democracy are suspect, the precious preoccupation of idealistic chumps. Do anthropology, philosophy and history stand a chance?\n\n\nWhite House officials are preparing an executive order targeting tech companies with what they see as “woke” artificial-intelligence models, their latest effort to go after diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/white-house-prepares-executive-order-targeting-woke-ai-e68e8e24?st=eqQBGd&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(As Krugman noted in a recent news letter: “So in modern Republican rhetoric, anything to the left of MAGA ideology is communist extremism. And here’s the thing: The answers you get from AI generally don’t adhere to the right-wing party line. … it all goes back to Stephen Colbert’s dictum, almost 20 years ago, that “reality has a well-known liberal bias.” )\n\nThe order would dictate that AI companies getting federal contracts be politically neutral and unbiased in their AI models, an effort to combat what administration officials see as liberal bias in some models, the people said.\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

    "text": "(The testimony in front of the House Committee on Education & Workforce seems not to have dealt any serious blows to any of the three leaders, including CUNY’s Chancellor – Stefanik’s predictable demand that he be fired has not been amplified, save for in the Times of India. The rope-a-dope style where responses fall back on policies and carrying them out while admitting individual tweets or comments may be reprehensible might be smart politics, but leaves a sour taste. The rope-a-dope is meant to tire people out for a counter attack, and the latter wasn’t the intent. I felt there were more than a few missed opportunities:\n\nI thought Stefanik’s questioning on Abda had such a faulty premise – she had worked at CAIR so shouldn’t be employable – needed some push back. There was not a hint of suggestion that her work for CUNY has been problematic or compromised, yet people should be fired. Plus, the NYT reported her characterization of CAIR is wholly unfounded.\nHer question about CUNY clear was so poorly framed as to require a reprimand by the ranking member in his closing – people accused deserve representation and the egregious examples of this particular case are so bad something could have been said beyond they choose their own cases.\nThe Hunter College questions involved showing someone’s email–doxxing–and was essentially a call for punishment for involving the police in a police matter. [thanks EI]\nThe questions about Jewish Faculty being represented by the PSC from one congressman who tried to get the Chancellor to admit it was unfair could have had much more pushback – this case was appealed to the supreme court which declined to hear it. Basically this congressman was asking the Chancellor to go against several judge’s opinions. Maybe pointing that out shows the ridiculousness of this and other questions.\nThe PSC positions were mis-characterized; the PSC Chair was personally dragged and mis-characterized–the rope-a-dope that the union is an independent group could have been turned into a counterattack to the assault on faculty unions in general.\n\nIf any good came out of this, hopefully it will be the republican majority realizing these hearings have totally lost their potency. Maybe the reporting next time will pick up the consistent message of the democrats that these aren’t seriously trying to understand a problem.)\n\n3 College Presidents Went to Congress. Here’s What They Talked About.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/3-college-presidents-went-to-congress-heres-what-they-talked-about\n(Thanks BE for summarizing these links, VAC for sharing)\n\nThe congressional hearings don’t appear to pack as much punch as they once did, when it felt like college presidents’ jobs were on the line.\n\n\nThe Trump administration’s campaign is like The Wizard of Oz, he [Nosanchuk, former civil-rights official] said, because it’s “projecting an intimidating, demanding, and illusory image of action, but here the man behind the curtain cancels funds for civil-rights enforcement and cancer research.”\n\n\nRep. Virginia Foxx, a Republican of North Carolina, mentioned the fact that the influential union has passed multiple BDS resolutions, and that it has been found responsible for discrimination against a Jewish faculty member by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the president of the PSC, James C. Davis, slammed Republicans’ “attempt to smear CUNY and our union as antisemitic.”\n\n\n“We do not accept the false premise that underlies today’s hearing that any campus activism in support of the Palestinian people is antisemitic, if not criminal,” Davis wrote. “As a union, we do not have a position on BDS and do not have Israel divestment policies.”\n\n\n3 More Campus Leaders Face Congress\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/16/3-more-campus-leaders-face-congress\n\nFor the fifth time since late 2023, congressional Republicans on Tuesday interrogated a group of university leaders about campus antisemitism. But unlike previous hearings, this one was short on fireworks and viral moments\n\n\nHouse Republicans Grill CUNY Chief on Campus Antisemitism Claims\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/07/15/cuny-felix-matos-rodriguez-antisemitism-house-elise-stefanik/\n(Grill was the headline choice of many others, mostly the slanted right side of reporting)\n\nSome of the toughest questioning of Matos Rodríguez again came from Stefanik, an ally of President Donald Trump who is reportedly considering a run for governor in New York after the president withdrew her nomination to be U.N. Ambassador to protect Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\n\nPSC president Davis then went on to decry what he saw as a clamp down on free speech across the university campuses.\n\n\n“CUNY administrators have investigated faculty for the terms in which they discuss the war in Gaza in their classes, limited the time, place, and manner for exercising the right to free expression on campus, invited police violence against non-violent student protestors, and even fired faculty in apparent retribution for their political activism,” Davis said. “It is still not enough to satisfy the new McCarthyites. Universities must stand against fascism, not accommodate it.”\n\n\nNYTimes: University Leaders Reject Republican Attacks on Campus Antisemitism\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/us/politics/antisemitism-hearing-uc-berkeley-georgetown-cuny.html\n\nOn Tuesday, Republicans accused the university leaders of fostering an antisemitic climate and failing to rein in professors and students the lawmakers said were antisemitic. Democrats on the committee argued the hearing was part of a crackdown on speech that attempted to scapegoat academia for a broader societal problem.\n\n\nThe university leaders, meanwhile, seemed to have learned from the past. They attempted, with apparent success, to avoid the kinds of viral moments that have characterized previous antisemitism hearings and brought down other university presidents.\n\n\nShe [Stefanik] attacked CUNY for hiring a former employee of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights organization, inaccurately suggesting that CAIR had been a “co-conspirator in a terrorist financing case.” (The group was listed as an “unindicted co-conspirator or joint venturer” in a case against a charity, the Holy Land Foundation, along with more than 200 other groups and individuals. It was not accused of a crime.)\n\n\nResponding to Ms. Stefanik’s attacks on Tuesday, CAIR’s national deputy director, Edward Ahmed Mitchell, said the “spirit of Joseph McCarthy is alive and well.” “Representing Mahmoud Khalil and others targeted by the government because they advocated for Palestinian rights is not only our prerogative as lawyers at CLEAR,” said Mr. Kassem, the CUNY law professor who founded the legal clinic, “it is also our pride and privilege.”\n\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik skewers CUNY chancellor, calls for his ouster over ‘failed’ leadership on NYC campus antisemitism\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2025/07/15/us-news/rep-elise-stefanik-skewers-cuny-chancellor-calls-for-his-ouster-over-failed-leadership-on-nyc-campus-antisemitism/\n(Cuz why? don’t ask – CUNY hired someone she didn’t like who in several years has no complaints mentioned about her work; lawyers represent people before they are proven not guilty or guilty?)\n\nThe Republican congresswoman zeroed in on Chancellor Félix Matos Rodríguez over the hiring of a chief diversity officer who previously worked for a pro-Hamas, Israel-bashing group — saying that if the CUNY boss doesn’t step down, Gov. Kathy Hochul should bounce him.\n\n\nStefanik also asked Matos Rodríguez if he knew that law professor Ramzi Kassem, the head of CUNY Law School’s legal clinic, Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility or CLEAR, was representing Mahmoud Khalil, the anti-Israel Columbia University protester who was detained by the Trump administration.\n\n\nIn a joint press conference after the hearing with Brooklyn Councilwoman Inna Vernikov in DC, Stefanik said Matos Rodríguez had to go, and claimed Hochul was part of the problem.\n\n(Just testing their powers; doubt either was packing today, but can’t vouch for that on other days.)\n(And what is wrong with the Post?

Observers wondered whether it was the start of another lengthy, destructive American war in the Middle East.\n\n\nHours later, a conservative social media account with more than 4.3 million followers highlighted one response—allegedly from a Georgetown University professor. According to a screenshot the Libs of TikTok X account posted, Jonathan Brown, the Alwaleed bin Talal Chair of Islamic Civilization, had written on X, “I hope Iran does some symbolic strike on a base, then everyone stops.”\n\n\nWhat transpired is becoming a familiar story in U.S. higher education: Conservatives denounce a faculty member’s speech, members of Congress join in and eventually pressure a prestigious university’s president to publicly denounce and punish the scholar.\n\n\nGreg Afinogenov, an associate history professor and president of Georgetown’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said Brown has received “death threats, his family has come under attack and members of the university administration have also criticized him and disavowed him.”\n\n\nAfinogenov said the university should clarify that Brown’s post was “protected speech.”\n\n\n“This procedure of hauling members of university administrations before” a “congressional kangaroo court” harms academic freedom, he said.

    "text": "What Trump’s Bombast Reveals About His Vision for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/15/how-public-attacks-harvard-harm-all-higher-ed\n\nQ: Do you think the administration has a vision for higher education in particular?\n\n\nA: I think it’s a vision for America, and Trump has been remarkably clear on what that looks like. It’s an America defined pretty narrowly on racial, ethnic and religious terms. It’s an America that has a certain understanding of its history that aligns with those dominant religious, racial and ethnic groups. It’s an America that has doubled down on masculinity as its defining gender in terms of who should be in power and have power in public life. So when we talk about a vision for higher ed, it’s a higher ed that serves that.\n\n\nThis is what you see in these very vague pronouncements about things like DEI. Anyone who educates or does research on anything that runs counter to that celebration of a very particularistic America is suspect and un-American. Higher ed is part of a whole set of knowledge-producing institutions in society—we can think about journalists and scientists, too— as being problematic because they serve accountability functions. They hold corporations responsible for things like polluting. They hold executives responsible for violations of democratic norms. Or, you know, they hold people in power accountable for not being good custodians of public trust. I think the administration wants to weaken that accountability function that can be played by universities because it undermines, ultimately, their ability to exercise power in the service of that larger vision of what they believe America should be.\n\n\nQ: You mentioned vague pronouncements about things like DEI. What conclusions do you draw from this tactic of sowing confusion and using unclear and undefined language?\n\n\nA: Ultimately, the end goal is control. They have a few tools to do so—legal means, regulatory means—and they have a lot of funding means to get institutions that are otherwise autonomous in civil society to comply with what they want them to do. But in the absence of those levers, what do you use? Well, you use publicity to get willing compliance or anticipatory compliance.\n\n\nWhy Universities Are So Powerless in Their Fight Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/why-universities-are-so-powerless-in-their-fight-against-trump\n\nThe administration’s moves to slash federal funding are just one part of a concerted effort to force major research universities to change how they pursue their core missions. And yet the sector’s most full-throated response — an American Association of Colleges and Universities statement signed by over 600 academic leaders — makes only vague reference to “constructive reform” while rejecting coercive uses of public funding. Widely adopted faculty resolutions calling for mutual-defense pacts amount to little more than suggestions that have yet to bear fruit. The most successful instances of collective resistance to date are four lawsuits challenging agency indirect-cost policies. By my count, 23 universities have joined at least one of those suits.\n\n\nA decentralized organizational structure puts resources and decision-making authority nearer to the ground, allowing different units of the university to prioritize the things their work requires. Faculties in business, social work, or law can make curricular, hiring, and promotion decisions largely independent of each other and of colleagues in arts and sciences, each tuning their activities to their specific needs, goals, and vision. Decentralization also explains why universities rarely articulate detailed, actionable principles that unequivocally guide institutionwide decision-making — or at least why, when they do proffer strategic plans or mission statements, the results are often anodyne.\n\n\nUniversities are organized to hold contradictions, not to resolve them. Typical academic decision-making processes manage the ambiguities that multiple goals create in lieu of picking winners in the underlying conflicts. That works well in normal times, but it is disastrously bad for reaching, communicating, and acting on common priorities under threat. Yet universities’ public missions may now require them to do just that.\n\n\nProminent conservatives generally agree that hardball tactics are necessary to compel desired changes in academe. JD Vance advocated for “honestly and aggressively” attacking universities. Leo Terrell, who heads the Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, wants financial pressures “to bring these universities to their knees.” As the conservative commentator Heather Mac Donald puts it: “The concept of academic freedom should be scaled back to allow funders — especially taxpayers — a say in how universities are run, including in what is taught.” The activist Christopher F. Rufo believes “existential terror” will provide the leverage needed to make an ultimatum stick: “Reform, or lose billions in funding.” That threat is now being carried out, and the administration’s will to back it up has been on clear display. As Robert Kelchen put it, “Every revenue source is at risk.” Federal research grants and contracts are just the beginning.\n\n\nThe Columbia example shows that the decisions institutions targeted by the Trump administration face have far-reaching, complex implications that take them far outside the standard mechanisms of academic leadership. The most easily defensible choice for any institution may be to protect its interests by negotiating for the best individual deal. But, as one Harvard professor pointed out, “that might be quite bad for higher education as a whole.”\n\n\nThe Harvard case has, so far, revealed this administration’s willingness to flip every policy lever available to them to reshape universities. It suggests a more complex landscape and more wrenching decisions are in store — choices that will certainly pit a university against itself, further fragmenting and undermining coordinated responses.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Winning the Race to the Bottom\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/opinion/trump-america-china.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nPopulists are anti-intellectual. President Trump isn’t pumping research money into the universities; he’s draining it out. The administration is not tripling the National Science Foundation’s budget; it’s trying to gut it. The administration is trying to cut all federal basic research funding by a third, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. A survey by the journal Nature of 1,600 scientists in the United States found that three-quarters of them have considered leaving the country.\n\n\nAmerica’s leaders understood that a superpower rivalry is as much an intellectual contest as a military and economic one. It’s who can out-innovate whom. So they fought the Soviet threat with education, with the goal of maximizing talent on our side.\n\n\n“One reason the U.S. economy had such a good Cold War was that the American university had an ever better one,” the historian Hal Brands writes in his book “The Twilight Struggle.” Federal support for academic research rose to $1.45 billion in 1970 from $254 million in 1958. Earlier in that century, American universities lagged behind their “best” European peers, Brands observes; by the end of the Cold War, they dominated the globe.",

    "text": "New Report on the State of Academic Governance in Community Colleges\n\n(Thanks to JC and VAC)\nhttps://www.aaup.org/news/new-report-state-academic-governance-community-colleges\n\nAt most responding institutions, and especially at responding institutions with tenure systems, faculty authority is consistent with AAUP-recommended governance standards in decision-making about programmatic, departmental, and institutional curricula; teaching assignments; salary policies; and faculty searches, evaluations, and tenure and promotion standards.\n\n\nHowever, in several decision-making areas, including budgets, buildings, provost selection, and strategic planning, community college faculty have few meaningful opportunities to participate. In these areas, community colleges deviate from the principles set forth in the AAUP’s 1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities, which emphasizes faculty involvement in personnel decisions and budget preparation.\n\n\nStatistically significant differences in the level of faculty authority between unionized and nonunionized colleges appear in only three of the twenty-six areas, a finding that mirrors that in the AAUP’s 2021 Shared Governance Survey of four-year institutions. Specifically, institutions where the faculty engages in collective bargaining have higher levels of faculty authority in areas related to salary policies teaching loads, and, in the case of community colleges, full-time non-tenure-track faculty promotion decisions.\n\n\nAcross most areas of academic and personnel decision-making, levels of faculty authority are lower at community colleges than at four-year institutions. However, faculty members at community colleges have more involvement in salary policies than those at four-year institutions; the difference is likely related to the higher prevalence of institutions with collective bargaining in the community college sector.",

    "text": "Texas just gutted free speech on college campuses. Is your state next?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/07/14/texas-campus-free-speech/\n\nAcross the country, state legislators have been racing to exert new influence over free expression in higher education. Now, Texas has surged to the forefront, closing its 2025 legislative session by passing two alarming laws that take effect Sept. 1.\n\n\nthe new laws amount to a stunningly aggressive legislative crackdown on campus protest (S.B. 2972) and academic shared governance (S.B. 37) at public colleges and universities. The laws will not just silence dissent and undermine faculty authority in Texas; they provide a blueprint for how to dismantle academic freedom and chill speech on campus state by state.\n\n\nNow, some of the same legislators have done an about-face. The campus protest law actually directs public colleges and universities to implement a version of free-speech zones and adopt sweeping limitations on protests. Encampments? Banned. Megaphones or speakers during “class hours”? Forbidden — if anyone claims your “expressive activity” is one that “intimidates others” or “interferes” with an employee’s duties. Even wearing a mask during a protest — something many do for safety — could land a student or employee a disciplinary hearing resulting in “sanctions.” And any expressive activity between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. is off-limits altogether.\n\n\nState law defines “expressive activity” as “any speech or expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment” — speeches, writing, art, symbolic actions, even just talking to your friends. It’s problematic enough that legislators seek to prohibit nighttime or early-morning protest activity, but the language could affect late-night art events, student journalists, and even assigned research, course or thesis work for students or faculty in the habit of burning the midnight oil. The new law is so absurdly broad it could theoretically be used to stop a group of students from discussing politics on a campus bench at night. That’s not security; it’s suppression.\n\n\nAnd this is just half the story.\n\n\nThe second new law in Texas is an outright power grab dismantling shared governance, the cornerstone of U.S. higher education. Typically, higher education institutions have democratic systems to share power and foster collaboration among administrators, governing boards and faculty. Faculty senates, whose members are typically elected by faculty, exercise authority over curricular matters, academic policies and graduation requirements. In addition, they often play a role in general institutional decisions, such as related to planning, budgeting or the evaluation of administrators.\n\n\nThe Texas legislature obliterates these traditions, stripping faculty of any meaningful decision-making role in how their institutions are run. Under this law, faculty senates at public universities and colleges can now exist only if permitted by the institutions’ governing boards — the oversight bodies whose members are politically appointed by the state governor. In mockery of democratic principles, half of the faculty senate members must be chosen by the university president, and administrators can remove faculty for not conducting their duties within vague “senate parameters.”\n\n\nTo make matters worse, the law installs a governor-appointed “ombudsman” with sweeping enforcement powers. This political appointee will be charged with monitoring compliance with state laws and can recommend that a public university or college lose all state funding unless it complies.\n\n\n\n\nTech billionaire Trump adviser Marc Andreesen says universities will ‘pay the price’ for DEI\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/07/12/marc-andreessen-private-chat-universities-diversity/\n\nThe investor described a “counterattack” against universities in his messages and called for the National Science Foundation, a federal research funding agency, to receive “the bureaucratic death penalty.”\n\n\n“The universities are at Ground Zero of the counterattack” from Trump voters, Andreessen wrote, alleging colleges favored immigrants over Americans and promoted DEI, or diversity, equity, and inclusion policies intended to increase race and gender representation.\n\n\n“The combination of DEI and immigration is politically lethal,” Andreessen wrote. “When these two forms of discrimination combine, as they have for the last 60 years and on hyperdrive for the last decade, they systematically cut most of the children of the Trump voter base out of any realistic prospect of access to higher education and corporate America.”\n\n(Yeah, right)\n\n\nNYTimes: Inside the Conservative Campaign That Took Down the U.Va. President\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/us/politics/university-virginia-president-trump-dei-jefferson-council.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFor years, the group [The Jefferson Council] had railed against the university’s president, James E. Ryan, for his robust promotion of campus diversity initiatives.\n\n\nThe Justice Department then hired a lawyer to help enforce those orders at the Office of Civil Rights: Gregory W. Brown, a University of Virginia alumnus and donor.\n\n\nThe Jefferson Council and the Office of Civil Rights separately denied in interviews that they had worked in concert. But the council had at least set the table for what came next. And in his new position, Mr. Brown helped engineer an unusual and concerted pressure campaign that would lead to Mr. Ryan’s resignation.\n\n\nAnd in his new position, Mr. Brown helped engineer an unusual and concerted pressure campaign that would lead to Mr. Ryan’s resignation.\n\n\nThat campaign showed just how far the Office of Civil Rights — which had for decades been at the center of the fight for racial equality — would go to take on universities that it views as hostile to its new agenda. By issuing a stream of demands and threats, the office essentially sped past the university board, appointed by the governor, that has oversight of its flagship public university.\n\n\n“What the Justice Department did was very similar to what President Eisenhower did,” Mr. Gardner [the Jefferson Council president] said, comparing the Trump administration’s actions to the 1957 White House decision to dispatch troops to Little Rock, Ark., to enforce the Supreme Court’s school desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education.\n\n(Uhh…)\n\nThere were other requests [In addition to the 7 letters]. The New York Times reported that the Trump administration had privately demanded Mr. Ryan’s ouster to help resolve its investigation into the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, according to three people briefed on the matter.\n\n\nMs. Dhillon, in an interview with the Times, denied that her office had pressured the university to remove its president.",

    "text": "Higher-Ed Associations Pitch an Alternative to Trump’s Cap on Research Funding\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/higher-ed-associations-pitch-an-alternative-to-trumps-cap-on-research-funding\n\nThe Joint Associations Group, or JAG, which includes the Association of American Universities (AAU), the American Council on Education (ACE), and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), announced its proposal on Friday. The coalition sees its plan as a middle ground, one that responds to long-held gripes about how indirect costs are administered while lessening the billions in lost revenue for universities under the 15-percent indirect-cost cap proposed by several federal agencies, among them the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Departments of Defense and Energy.\n\n\nThe plan’s true effect on how much universities would receive for indirect costs is unclear. H. Holden Thorp, editor in chief of the Science family of journals and a former university chancellor, who is not part of JAG but has reviewed the proposal, said such a fundamental change to how universities balance their research budgets will be costly. The amount of funding received under the FAIR model “absolutely will be less,” he said, but “it won’t be as bad as it was going to be” under the Trump administration’s proposed 15-percent cap.\n\n\n\n\nHouse Appropriators Propose 23% Cut to NSF\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/15/house-appropriators-propose-23-cut-nsf\n\nHouse Republicans want to cut the National Science Foundation’s funding by about $2 billion, according to budget documents released Monday.\n\n\nStill, funding for NSF is already one point of disagreement between House and Senate appropriators. Last week, Senate Republicans indicated that they would cut only about $16 million from NSF, leaving the agency with just over $9 billion.\n\n\nThe House plan, which would give NSF about $7 billion, is just a proposal and doesn’t go as far as President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026, which cuts more than $5 billion from the agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Live Updates: Supreme Court Clears Way for Dismantling of Education Department\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/07/14/us/trump-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe order is a significant victory for the administration and could ease President Trump’s efforts to sharply curtail the federal government’s role in the nation’s schools.\n\n\nIt also represents an expansion of presidential power, allowing Mr. Trump to functionally eliminate a government department created by Congress, without legislators’ input.\n\n\nIt comes after a decision by the justices last week that cleared the way for the Trump administration to move forward with cutting thousands of jobs across a number of federal agencies, including the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, State and Treasury.\n\n\nThe order by the court was unsigned and gave no reasoning, as is typical in such emergency applications. No vote count was given, which is usual for emergency orders, but Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissent, joined by the court’s other two liberals, Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\n\nThe order is technically temporary, applying while appeals proceed through the courts. In practice, thousands of fired workers whom a Boston judge had ordered be reinstated are now again subject to removal from their jobs.\n\n(Sotamayor)\n\nThe President must take care that the laws are faithfully executed, not set out to dismantle them. That basic rule undergirds our Constitution’s separation of powers. Yet today, the majority rewards clear defiance of that core principle with emergency relief.

Polls show that a lot of Americans consider them too liberal, too expensive and too elitist, and not entirely without reason.\n\n(Why the lede needs to add that last bit is beyond me…)\n\nToday, the biggest beneficiary could be China and Chinese universities, which have been trying to recruit world-class scientific talent for years. Now Mr. Trump is doing their work for them. One indication of the success of China’s campaign to attract the best and brightest is Africa, the world’s youngest continent. Africans are learning Mandarin in growing numbers. Nearly twice as many study in China as in America.\n\n\nCould America gamble away its scientific supremacy in the service of ideology? It has happened before. Under the Nazis, Germany lost its scientific edge to America in the space of a few years. As a German, my brain may wander too readily to the lessons of the 1930s, but in this case the analogy feels instructive. Several of my colleagues covering the fallout from the crackdown on international students and researchers pointed to Hitler’s silencing of scientists and intellectuals.\n\n\nI don’t sense a big change in the mood in India yet. The United States still holds a lot of soft power and remains very attractive to Indians. In fact, many Indians are seeing something that is pretty familiar to them. They’re saying, “Welcome to the world as we have experienced it for the past few years.” The government under Narendra Modi has definitely cracked down on free speech. It has tried to quash dissenting voices, and it has also leaned on academics and has tried to squeeze certain research institutions that it considers too liberal. And there has been a demonization of the Muslim minority, which make up about 15 percent of the population. There are a lot of similarities to Trump’s America. Everyone in the world is just trying to understand what Trump’s actions mean for their own countries. So India’s experience can be instructive in making sense of this moment. [Anupreeta Das is a South Asia correspondent for the Times,]\n\n\nChina really wants to become a center for international education, because it sees that as a key ingredient for building its reputation as a global superpower. American universities have long been a source of American soft power. China wants Chinese universities to be a source of Chinese soft power. And now Trump is doing their work for them. You can see that in China’s rhetoric and messaging. It’s trying to portray itself as open and international, everything that the Trump administration is turning away from. [Vivian Wang is a correspondent for the Times in Beijing]\n\n\n\n\nTrump wields his ‘secret weapon’: College accreditation\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/12/trump-college-accreditation-political-influence/\n(“his” What about just saying weaponizing …)\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his allies are using a little-known but powerful corner of higher education — college accreditation — to exert pressure on colleges and universities, an effort that threatens the independence of accreditors and the stability of the institutions they approve.\n\n\nThis week, the Education and Health and Human Services departments encouraged Harvard University’s accreditor to take action against the Ivy League school for allegedly violating the civil rights of Jewish students. The New England Commission of Higher Education, which accredits Harvard, said it has given the university until Aug. 15 to respond and will take up the matter at a previously scheduled meeting in September.\n\n\nThe administration took a similar step in early June over Columbia University’s alleged civil rights violations. By the end of June, Columbia’s accreditor, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, issued the school a noncompliance warning. Middle States did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n“It’s unusual for [the Office of Civil Rights] to directly involve itself in accrediting matters,” said John R. Przypyszny, a lawyer who specializes in accreditation.\n\n\nWhile the Trump administration has no direct control over whether the schools remain accredited, it could punish accreditors for failing to act by stripping them of the authority needed to operate. And a recent move by the Education Department is raising questions about whether the administration is dangling that possibility over Harvard and Columbia’s accreditors.\n\n\nA day after notifying Columbia’s accreditor of the Ivy League school’s alleged violations in June, the Education Department postponed a meeting of the federal advisory committee that oversees accreditors from July to October. The 18-member committee was scheduled to vote this summer on whether Middle States and the New England Commission should remain certified to accredit colleges.\n\n\nBy the time the committee meets this fall, the terms of six of its members will have expired. The House, Senate and education secretary take turns appointing members, and this time the secretary will fill all six seats. That gives the Trump administration a chance to select people who are aligned with its ideology on higher education.\n\n\n“It seems like they’re trying to fix the vote,” said Robert Shireman, a member of the committee who is also a senior fellow at the left-leaning Century Foundation.\n\n\nSeveral committee members said the Education Department flouted the rules of the panel, which says only the chair can set a meeting schedule. When Zakiya Smith Ellis, who assumed the role of chair in February, pointed that out, she said the department told her it did not recognize her as chair because she took over the position when the previous chair resigned.\n\n\nDespite Reservations, Florida Approves New Accreditor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/state-policy/2025/07/11/despite-reservations-florida-bog-approves-new-accreditor\n\nThe decision came after about an hour of heated discussion between board members and the State University System of Florida’s chancellor regarding details of the plan.\n\n\nChancellor Raymond Rodriguez argued that the new accreditor, called the Commission for Public Higher Education, would eliminate the bureaucracy that comes with existing accrediting agencies and focus specifically on the needs of public universities.\n\n\n“The Commission for Public Higher Education will offer an accreditation model that prioritizes academic excellence and student success while removing ideological bias and unnecessary financial burdens,” he said. “Through the CPHE, public colleges and universities across the country will have access to an accreditation process that is focused on quality, rooted in accountability and committed to continuous improvement.”\n\n\nBut before voting in favor of the motion, board members repeatedly pushed back, arguing that the plans for starting an accreditor from scratch were half-baked.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: As Harvard and Trump Head to Court, the Government Piles on the Pressure\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/us/harvard-trump-head-to-trial.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement served subpoenas to Harvard with sprawling demands that included payroll records, years of disciplinary files and any videos Harvard had of international students protesting on campus since 2020, according to two people familiar with the subpoenas, some of which were reviewed by The New York Times. The agency gave the university a breakneck one-week deadline for compliance.\n\n\nAlso this month, the administration formally accused the school of civil rights violations, arguing that Harvard had failed to protect Jewish people on campus. The government also complained to the university’s accreditor, which could eventually jeopardize Harvard students’ access to federal financial aid.\n\n\nHarvard leaders are well aware that a long fight with the government is perilous, threatening jobs, projects, reputations and academic independence. Some inside the university have feared that civil inquiries could become criminal matters.\n\n\nBefore the lawsuit, the administration sent Harvard an extraordinary list of conditions, including new policies on hiring, admissions and faculty influence, compulsory reports to the government and audits of academic programs and departments. Since then, although officials acknowledged that sending the letter was a mistake, the government has barely budged from the demands.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia and Trump Near a Deal, With School Possibly Paying Millions\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/11/nyregion/columbia-university-trump-deal-antisemitism.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe existence of a potential deal was confirmed by a third person, who, like the others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive negotiations.\n\n(Methinks this may be a planted story to put pressure on Columbia, but what do I know.)\n\nA university spokeswoman on Friday night did not confirm details of the deal or the potential White House meeting. “The university is focused on advancing the discussions with the federal government. There is no resolution at this time,” the spokeswoman, Virginia Lam Abrams, said.\n\n\nThe deal could include $200 million or more in compensation paid by Columbia for alleged civil rights violations. Columbia officials are expected to meet with Trump aides next week at the White House to finalize the deal, said one of the people familiar with the discussions.\n\n\nAnd Harvard, despite its litigation, has also restarted talks with the Trump administration regarding the return of billions of dollars in federal research funding that have been cut.\n\n\nThe current draft of the deal, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and The Free Beacon, does not go as far in exerting federal authority over the university as an earlier version that was circulated in April.\n\n\nThe negotiations with Columbia have been directed out of the White House by a team led by a Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, with additional involvement of an interagency task force on antisemitism.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-columbia-civil-rights-settlement-86f64531\nhttps://freebeacon.com/campus/columbia-nears-deal-with-trump-administration-university-will-pay-discrimination-victims-reveal-more-admissions-and-hiring-data-but-will-dodge-harsher-measures-like-governance-shakeup/\n(From Wikipedia “The New York Times credited the Free Beacon with breaking, together with Chris Rufo,[23] and subsequently expanding, reportage on the plagiarism accusations against Harvard President Claudine Gay” which is about the nicest way to say they made mountains out of mole hills)\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Expands Efforts to Fight Antisemitism as Trump Deal Seems Near\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/nyregion/columbia-plan-to-fight-antisemitism.html\n\nMs. Shipman announced that the changes would include formally incorporating the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism into the work of a recently established office at Columbia that considers complaints of discrimination and discriminatory harassment.\n\n\nIn addition, Columbia will appoint two new coordinators to oversee investigations into claims of discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Those coordinators will produce a publicly available report each year about discrimination investigations and their results.\n\n\nThe university will also institute new educational programs about antisemitism for students and faculty and staff members, including those developed by national organizations such as Project Shema, a training and support organization, and the Anti-Defamation League. And it will reaffirm that it has zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment based on protected traits, including Jewish and Israeli identity.\n\n\nJoseph Howley, a professor of classics and supporter of the pro-Palestinian movement on campus, was critical for different reasons. The definition of antisemitism being adopted by the university, he said, “is not informed by scholarly expertise or even best practice. So it’s not the best framework for confronting hate speech, and it’s not going to solve real problems of discrimination or harassment.”\n\n\nAnti-Semitism Gets the DEI Treatment - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/columbia-anti-semitism-trump/683586/\n\nTo do the same thing over and over and expect a different result is one definition of insanity. According to Robert Shibley, a special counsel of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), it’s also Columbia University’s approach to addressing anti-Semitism on campus.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Claire Shipman, Columbia’s acting president, announced in an email to the community that the university would take several steps to quell anti-Semitism on campus. Columbia will appoint Title VI and Title VII coordinators to review allegations of discrimination. It will launch new programming around anti-Jewish discrimination, send out regular messages affirming its zero-tolerance policy on hate, and use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of anti-Semitism for certain disciplinary proceedings. In her message, Shipman promised that the university would continue making reforms until it had stamped out anti-Semitism. “In a recent discussion, a faculty member and I agreed that anti-Semitism at this institution has existed, perhaps less overtly, for a long while, and the work of dismantling it, especially through education and understanding, will take time,” she wrote.\n\n\nThe message was notable for how closely it resembled the communications that university presidents have previously sent out about other forms of discrimination. Replace the references to “anti-Semitism” with “racism,” and Shipman’s message could practically have been lifted from the statements of summer 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy attack colleges? To open students’ minds or blow up institutions?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/07/16/trump-dei-george-mason-university/\n\nNow, the mission has gone off the rails: The Trump administration is coming for George Mason University, one of Virginia’s largest colleges, which has done more than almost any other campus in the country to become conservative-friendly.\n\n\nSadly, George Mason’s course will likely be determined not by its president or faculty, but by politicians in Richmond and judges in courtrooms. A Fairfax County judge is expected to rule later this month on a move by Democrats in the Virginia Senate to block approval of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s (R) nominees to the school’s board. And when Virginia voters choose a new governor this fall, they will be deciding who gets to nominate board members next year.\n\n\nThere was a time, not long ago, when governance of public universities was a bipartisan effort, devoted to building civic knowledge and advancing the skills of the next generation. Politics and culture wars weren’t the primary focus.\n\n\nwe have unthinking attacks on any and all colleges — another example of government gone wild. Trump campaigned last year on smacking down elite colleges’ “Marxist assault on our American heritage and Western civilization itself.” What’s he delivering, perversely enough, is his own reactionary assault on the institutions that transmit our heritage to the inheritors of our democracy.\n\n\nGeorge Mason President Defends Univ. Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/18/gmu-president-responds-civil-rights-investigation\n\n“I can assure you that George Mason has always operated with a commitment to equality under the law, ever since our inception,” he wrote. ”It is simply the Mason way, and in my experience, it has not discriminated based on race, color, national origin, or otherwise. Our diversity efforts are designed to expand opportunity and build inclusive excellence—not to exclude or advantage any group unlawfully.”\n\n\nHe offered a brief history of Title VI—which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in federally funded programs—and the rest of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Then, without naming any names, he essentially accused the Trump administration of willfully misinterpreting the law.\n\n\n“Today, we are seeing a profound shift in how Title VI is being applied,” he wrote. “Longstanding efforts to address inequality—such as mentoring programs, inclusive hiring practices, and support for historically underrepresented groups—are in many cases being reinterpreted as presumptively unlawful. Broad terms like ‘illegal DEI’ are now used without definition, allowing virtually any initiative that touches on identity or inclusion to be painted as discriminatory.\n\n\nTrump administration expands scrutiny of George Mason University\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/17/george-mason-doj-investigation/\n\nThe investigation [into the alleged use of race in hiring and promotions at George Mason University ] is the third launched by the administration in recent weeks into the policies and practices at the Northern Virginia university, and the first inquiry into the school led by the Justice Department.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs U-Va. president leaves, faculty say board failed to protect university\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/11/university-of-virginia-faculty-board-no-confidence-ryan/\n\nUniversity of Virginia faculty passed a vote of no confidence Friday in the school’s governing body, saying it failed to protect against “outside interference” by the Trump administration that led to the eventual resignation of President James E. Ryan.\n\n\nThe vote by the U-Va. faculty senate — which came on Ryan’s last day in office — called on the board to provide faculty with an “immediate and complete accounting” of its response to inquiries by the Justice Department in recent months.\n\n\nThe board leaders also said the Justice Department investigations were ongoing and that they would work hard to reach a voluntary settlement with the Trump administration as soon as they could.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Hiring: Title VI Coordinators\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/diversity/2025/07/14/colleges-hire-title-vi-coordinators-amid-federal-scrutiny\n\nin fiscal year 2022, before the Israel-Hamas war began, allegations of Title VI violations made up only 17.3 percent of the complaints OCR received, in comparison with Title XI (49.2 percent) and the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 (33.4 percent), which protect against disability discrimination.\n\n\nThe number of Title VI complaints increased 29.4 percent over the next two years. Complaints related to shared ancestry increased sevenfold from 2023 to 2024.\n\n\nIn other cases, it was a proactive step. In April, the State University of New York system, the largest public college system in the nation, required each of its campuses to bring on a Title VI coordinator by fall 2025.\n\n\n“We really have tried to be very thoughtful about ensuring that all of our campuses are safe and supportive environments free from harassment and discrimination. We take Title IX enforcement seriously,” said SUNY chancellor John B. King in an interview.",

But his move to Washington cost him an incredible $300 million.\n\n\n“I joined the Nvidia board in 2004, before the company took off, but I had to sell my shares in 2009 when I joined government,” Chu said about his early involvement in the microchip firm that recently became the world’s most valuable company with a $4 trillion capitalization.\n\n\nSanguine about his lost wealth, Chu’s main takeaway from Nvidia is not his own misfortune. Instead, he worries that this American success story—co-created by a Taiwanese-born Stanford graduate, employing foreign-born engineering talent—might not have been able to happen today given the double whammy faced by U.S. academia: massive cuts to federal science budgets and an immigration crackdown deterring many students, particularly from China, from applying to U.S. institutions.\n\n\nWithout America’s outstanding universities and with its foreign talent pool diminished, China’s path to global dominance will be immeasurably easier, predicted Chu. “Trump is perfectly willing to destroy institutions that any country in the world would give its eyeteeth for,” he said.",

    "text": "What Happens After A.I. Destroys College Writing?\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/07/the-end-of-the-english-paper\n\nHe opened Claude on his laptop. I noticed a chat that mentioned abolition. “We had to read Robert Wedderburn for a class,” he explained, referring to the nineteenth-century Jamaican abolitionist. “But, obviously, I wasn’t tryin’ to read that.” He had prompted Claude for a summary, but it was too long for him to read in the ten minutes he had before class started. He told me, “I said, ‘Turn it into concise bullet points.’” He then transcribed Claude’s points in his notebook, since his professor ran a screen-free classroom.\n\n\nI teach at a small liberal-arts college, and I often joke that a student is more likely to hand in a big paper a year late (as recently happened) than to take a dishonorable shortcut.\n\n\nThere are no reliable figures for how many American students use A.I., just stories about how everyone is doing it. A 2024 Pew Research Center survey of students between the ages of thirteen and seventeen suggests that a quarter of teens currently use ChatGPT for schoolwork, double the figure from 2023. OpenAI recently released a report claiming that one in three college students uses its products. There’s good reason to believe that these are low estimates.\n\n\nCorey Robin, a writer and a professor of political science at Brooklyn College, read the early stories about ChatGPT with skepticism. Then his daughter, a sophomore in high school at the time, used it to produce an essay that was about as good as those his undergraduates wrote after a semester of work. He decided to stop assigning take-home essays. For the first time in his thirty years of teaching, he administered in-class exams.\n\n\nBarry Lam teaches in the philosophy department at the University of California, Riverside, and hosts a popular podcast, Hi-Phi Nation, which applies philosophical modes of inquiry to everyday topics. He began wondering what it would mean for A.I. to actually be a productivity tool. … If students were learning things faster, then it stood to reason that Lam could assign them “something very hard.” He wanted to test this theory, so for final exams he gave his undergraduates a Ph.D.-level question involving denotative language and the German logician Gottlob Frege which was, frankly, beyond me.\n\n\n“They fucking failed it miserably,” he said. He adjusted his grading curve accordingly.\n\n\nWhen classes were over and students were moving into their summer housing, I e-mailed with Alex, who was settling in in the East Village. He’d just finished his finals, and estimated that he’d spent between thirty minutes and an hour composing two papers for his humanities classes. Without the assistance of Claude, it might have taken him around eight or nine hours. “I didn’t retain anything,” he wrote. “I couldn’t tell you the thesis for either paper hahhahaha.” He received an A-minus and a B-plus. ♦\n\n\nNYTimes: I’m Watching the Sacrifice of College’s Soul\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/opinion/college-soul-ai-education.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAnd perhaps a certain idea of college — a certain ideal of college — is dying. I [Frank Bruni] keep coming back to that possibility, which seems more like a probability since President Trump returned to the White House and began his assault on higher education.\n\n\nWhat happened to college as a theater of intellectual betterment, character development, self-discovery? Easy A’s work against that, replacing rigor with ready affirmation. A.I. also works against that: Why spend hour upon hour synthesizing knowledge when a few keystrokes will do the trick? And measuring schools by their financial return on students’ investments … occludes higher education’s other important functions. Colleges are supposed to nurture nimble thinkers. They’re meant to produce informed and enlightened citizens who are better equipped to leaven passion with reason. There’s a deficit of those now, as ominous as any budgetary shortfall.\n\n\nZimmerman [renowned historian of education at the University of Pennsylvania] said. “We continue to tell a story about the mind-expanding purpose and qualities of a university, and no doubt some people who come here experience that mind expansion. The problem is that all of the other cultural and social signals around them are pointing them in the other direction.”\n\n\nThe moral of those two stories is that the smartest approach to college may be precisely the one that its trajectory of late has conspired against: range widely across subject offerings and focus not on a skill that could become obsolete but on intellectual dexterity and powers of judgment with better odds of enduring relevance. “A liberal arts degree is a preprofessional degree — you just don’t know what the profession is,” said Zimmerman, who teaches a seminar for first-year students at U. Penn. called “Why College?”\n\n\nBut higher education as a blessing independent of any instantly redeemable credential bucks the zeitgeist. Under Trump, blunt materialism reigns, and such concepts as human rights, diplomacy and even democracy are suspect, the precious preoccupation of idealistic chumps. Do anthropology, philosophy and history stand a chance?\n\n\nWhite House officials are preparing an executive order targeting tech companies with what they see as “woke” artificial-intelligence models, their latest effort to go after diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/white-house-prepares-executive-order-targeting-woke-ai-e68e8e24?st=eqQBGd&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(As Krugman noted in a recent news letter: “So in modern Republican rhetoric, anything to the left of MAGA ideology is communist extremism. And here’s the thing: The answers you get from AI generally don’t adhere to the right-wing party line. … it all goes back to Stephen Colbert’s dictum, almost 20 years ago, that “reality has a well-known liberal bias.” )\n\nThe order would dictate that AI companies getting federal contracts be politically neutral and unbiased in their AI models, an effort to combat what administration officials see as liberal bias in some models, the people said.\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

This theory bases academic freedom not on freedom of speech—a troublesome basis for academic freedom—but on the university’s corporate rights. These corporate rights, not infrequently finding expression in constitutions, are also sometimes constitutional rights. By substituting corporate rights for freedom of speech, we turn a foundation of sand into stone.\n\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that, in spring 2025, we may have entered the nadir of American academic freedom. Austin Sarat rightfully urged us, even before then, to find new ways to guard academic freedom “against external threats.” Now, in the face of ongoing hostility from both state and federal governments, it is imperative that universities deploy the full range of arguments at their disposal, including those based on their forgotten corporate rights. In other words, it’s time for universities to invoke their corporate rights. Allow me to explain.\n\n\n“Incorporation,” David Ciepley has written, “is a powerful tool.” Corporations can sue and be sued in their own names, hold property, enter contracts, use their own seals and legislate. Importantly, the university’s corporateness bears no necessary relationship to its current autocratic constitution, whereby, according to Timothy V. Kaufman-Osborn, universities are “ruled by external lay governing boards vested with the panoply of powers customarily granted to corporations, including the power to adopt, amend, and revoke its basic rules of institutional governance.” Thus, we can use the university’s corporateness to rebuff external attacks, while also working, as Arjun Appadurai wrote recently, “to break the unilateral power of boards of trustees.”\n\n\n\n\necretly Recorded by Anti-DEI Group, ‘No Longer Employed’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/2025/06/30/secretly-recorded-anti-dei-group-now-no-longer-employed\n\nhe YouTube video is titled “CAUGHT ON TAPE: UNC Administrator Admits They Ignore DEI Ban.” Heart-pumping music plays.

Now Sanders, who was assistant director of the Office of Leadership and Community Engagement, is no longer employed by UNC Charlotte.\n\n\nWhere Anti-DEI Legislation Has Been Proposed\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/here-are-the-states-where-lawmakers-are-seeking-to-ban-colleges-dei-efforts\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nNYTimes: Trump Withholds Nearly $7 Billion for Schools, With Little Explanation\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/us/trump-education-funds.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(K-12, but still just reneging)\n\nThe Trump administration has declined to release nearly $7 billion in federal funding that helps pay for after-school and summer programs, support for students learning English, teacher training and other services.\n\n\nThe money was expected to be released by Tuesday. But in an email on Monday, the Education Department notified state education agencies that the money would not be available.\n\n\nMany school districts also rely on federal dollars to help non-English-speaking students and families, including training teachers and hiring translators.\n\n\nA Decades-Old Government Program That Supports Hispanic Students Is Under Fresh Scrutiny\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/a-decades-old-government-program-for-supporting-hispanic-students-is-under-fresh-scrutiny\n\nFor 30 years, colleges enrolling a certain share of Hispanic students have been able to secure a title that opens up millions in federal funding. Hundreds of them now qualify as Hispanic-serving institutions, or HSIs.\n\n\nBut those programs are now in the line of fire.\n\n\nThe U.S. Education Department doled out about $350 million to Hispanic-serving institutions in the 2024 fiscal year across three competitive grant programs; the National Science Foundation awarded another $53.5 million. Colleges can become eligible when at least 25 percent of their undergraduate students identify as Hispanic or Latino/a.\n\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions, the group responsible for the lawsuit that ended race-conscious admissions policies at selective colleges in 2023, has brought a new complaint in Tennessee arguing that federal funding designated solely for HSIs is discriminatory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese Students’ Vulnerable Status Has a History — and an Impact on the Future\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/chinese-students-vulnerable-status-has-a-history-and-an-impact-on-the-future\n\n“It does seem that Chinese students are being used as bargaining chips in the trade negotiations with China,” said Jonathan Bean, a research fellow at the Independent Institute and a professor of history at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.\n\n\n“It would be devastating. You really can’t run labs without these graduate students. You really can’t run these large courses,” said Wu. “The entire model of how universities run in the U.S. is at risk if we lose the supply of international students.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDOGE loses control over government grants website, freeing up billions\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/27/doge-loses-control-federal-grants/\n\nThree months ago, DOGE employees wrested control of a key federal grants website, grants.gov, which serves as a clearinghouse for more than $500 billion in annual awards, The Post reported. For most of the program’s existence, federal agencies including the Defense Department posted their funding opportunities directly to the site, where thousands of outside organizations could see and apply for them — until April, when DOGE staffers changed the website’s permissions to give themselves power to review and approve all grants across the government.\n\n\nBut on Thursday, federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, according to emails obtained by The Post and the two people, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive situation. The decision follows fears that months of DOGE-linked delays would lead to what critics allege would be the illegal impoundment of federal funds.\n\n\nPSC, higher-ed unions slam federal research funding cuts\n\nhttps://thechiefleader.com/stories/psc-higher-ed-unions-slam-federal-research-funding-cuts,54668\n\nResearchers at the city and state’s public universities affected by cuts to federal grant funding urged the state’s congressional leaders to oppose further cuts to funding proposed in President Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”\n\n\nMembers of the Professional Staff Congress, the New York State United Teachers and other higher-education advocates rallied against the existing and proposed funding reductions outside of the Trump Building at 40 Wall St. Monday.\n\n\nAt the City University of New York, 70 grants worth $17 million in funding have been slashed, which has put 100 jobs at risk, according to the PSC. And at SUNY, there have been $50 million in grant terminations.\n\n\nThe PSC’s president, James Davis, called the cuts to SUNY and CUNY “an outrage,” adding that cuts to research could delay life-saving medical treatments.\n\n\nKathleen Cumiskey, a psychology professor at the College of Staten Island who has worked at CUNY for 22 years, said that a $700,000 National Science Foundation grant for a three-year STEM education program aimed at improving academic outcomes at Hispanic-serving institutions was terminated on May 2, just 20 months into the program’s lifespan.\n\n\n“We believe the decision to terminate our grant was unfair. Unfortunately, under the current administration, it appears that the agency has been redirected in ways that threaten our nation’s scientific discovery and the importance of broad participation in the creation of new knowledge,” Cumiskey said.\n\n\nCity Comptroller Brad Lander joined the researchers, noting that higher education contributes $35 billion to the city’s economy and employs about 140,000 people.\n\n\n\n\nStalled funding, canceled grants: How the NIH crisis is affecting Duke - The Chronicle\n\nhttps://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2025/06/duke-university-national-institutes-of-health-cut-cancel-duke-research-nih-federal-funding-grants-trump-administrations\n\nDuke receives around $1.2 billion in research grants a year, and much of it comes from the NIH. In fiscal year 2024 NIH support totaled $580 million.\n\n\n“Most of the time, that’s a point of pride, a marker of success, but it’s also a point of challenge when that fundamental model is changing. This is what we’re dealing with now,” said Mary Klotman, executive vice president for health affairs and dean of the School of Medicine\n\n\nGrant Watch contains a field for “tagged_words” — which matches words from a list that The New York Times reported could trigger an automatic review of grants — to words used in a grant’s title or abstract. Noam Ross, a computational researcher part of Grant Watch, told The Chronicle that Grant Watch doesn’t know exactly how grants are flagged for termination, but “suspect that these words are part of a search process for selecting them based on [The New York Times article] and other reporting.”\n\n\nThe 15 canceled NIH grants contained flagged words like “expression,” “disability,” “trans” and “systemic.” However, these words were not used in contexts to promote DEI initiatives, although some may have had diversity supplements including the two described below.\n\n\nThe grant that had the word “disability” in its abstract focused on identifying biomechanical and biological factors that lead to early onset osteoarthritis following a partial meniscectomy — a surgical procedure commonly done to remove damaged meniscal tissue following a tear. The grant had over $750,000 remaining in funding at the time of termination.\n\n\nFurthermore, a grant that had both “trans” and “systemic” in its abstract was working toward editing neural circuits by engineering channel proteins to control the point of contact between two neurons. It had around $1.4 million remaining in funding at the time of termination.\n\n\nIn most other cases where “trans” was flagged, the term generally referred to other words with the trans- prefix, such as disease transmission, transgenic genetic material, translational studies or signal transduction.\n\n\nMost notably, the NIH ended Duke’s Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development, which was a $129 million program and a leader in its field. The program was in its sixth year of funding out of seven and was largely expected to be renewed for an additional cycle. Associated funding has not been listed as terminated in federal databases and thus was not included in the Grant Watch data analysis.\n\n\nThe Scientific Research Lost Amid the Trump Administration’s NIH Cuts — ProPublica\n\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/nih-cuts-research-lost-trump/\n\n\n\n\nE.P.A.

The Senate legislation underwent significant changes in the week leading up to its passage, several of which softened provisions in the House bill that had raised alarms across the sector. The Senate retained the House’s broad plan to raise the endowment tax, for example, but it limited the extent of the hike and opened up loopholes for small institutions.\n\n\nSenators abandoned a House plan to eliminate subsidized federal undergraduate loans. Also out: a House provision that would have required students to take 30 credit hours per academic year to receive the maximum Pell Grant award, and 15 credit hours to be eligible for Pell Grants at all. Community colleges were particularly panicked about the provision.\n\n\nThe Senate kiboshed a controversial risk-sharing plan introduced in the House bill, which would have forced colleges to kick money into a new pot of federal aid when their students defaulted on federal-loan repayment. Instead, it offered an alternative approach with roots in the gainful-employment rule, a cornerstone of the Obama administration’s accountability efforts.\n\n\nThe Senate-passed plan would yank federal-loan eligibility from programs that fail to deliver an earnings bump to their graduates. Senators tweaked the details in the days leading up to Tuesday’s vote so colleges would be judged on the earnings of their graduates, not dropouts.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy UVA President’s Resignation Could Be a ‘Watershed Moment’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/executive-leadership/2025/06/30/uva-reels-after-president-resigns-under-pressure\n\n“I think this is a watershed moment,” said Jon Holbein, an associate professor of public policy, politics and education at UVA. “If a moderate president at a conservative–for–higher education institution who has followed the law when it comes to diversity [can be pushed out], no president is immune from the Trump administration’s ire.”\n\n\nUVA faculty, some board members, students and community say Ryan’s departure is a blow to the institution. “His loss makes us worse,” said Michael Kennedy, a UVA professor and faculty representative on the Board of Visitors, describing Ryan as a “shattering success.”\n\n\nThe Jefferson Council, a conservative alumni group that publicly called for Ryan’s resignation, called the DEI efforts exclusive, discriminatory and “the new McCarthyism.”\n\n(I think that used to be called doublespeak; this organization seems to have been founded by someone who in March had this news: Youngkin fires Bert Ellis from University of Virginia Board of Visitors))\n\nThe U. of Virginia’s President Was Targeted Over DEI. Now He’s Resigning.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/university-of-virginia-president-reportedly-resigns-under-pressure-from-trump-administration\n\nPeter McDonough, vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education, called the government’s handling of the matter “a potentially ominous effort to control a learning environment it finds objectionable.”\n\n\n“This is unprecedented,” McDonough said in an interview. “Maybe we should have seen it coming.”\n\n\nDhillon said that the department had told UVa representatives that the government “lacked confidence” in Ryan, given his “participation in groups” that had publicly opposed the Trump administration’s policies. (Ryan, along with hundreds of other college presidents, signed a letter condemning “unprecedented government overreach” in higher education.)\n\n\nNYTimes: What the University of Virginia Should Have Done\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/30/opinion/university-of-virginia-doj-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUnder investigation by the Justice Department, the university had a strong defense, if only it had the courage to assert it. Instead of fighting back against what I believe to be false accusations that the university was violating federal law, and the even more outrageous demand that Mr. Ryan resign as a remedy for those alleged violations, the university’s Board of Visitors pushed out a popular president. Instead of presenting facts and law, the board waved the white flag of surrender. Mr. Ryan’s resignation is a victory for intimidation and fear over the rule of law.\n\n\nI served as university counsel at the University of Virginia from 2018 through 2022. During that time, it was my job to defend the university from unfounded allegations and investigations. The Justice Department has alleged that the university’s actions violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which states, “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” Had I been university counsel last week, I would have advised my client to challenge what I believe to be a false allegation that the university’s policies are unlawful.\n\n\nTitle VI prohibits racial classifications, quotas or programs that are exclusive to any one race, gender or protected class. It does not prevent federal contractors, such as universities, from pursuing the goal of creating a diverse community, one that ensures all individuals can participate in the learning environment regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, national origin or political ideology. Eligibility for programs and opportunities based on those and other immutable characteristics is illegal. Programs that create a pipeline of diverse applicants are not.\n\n\nWhile the university’s compliance with Title VI is clear to me, it was challenged by the Justice Department. Informed by the advocacy of the America First Legal Foundation, an organization founded by the current White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, the department alleged that the university’s compliance efforts were insufficient, a mere relabeling of D.E.I. programs that broke the law. The department’s proposed remedy was the resignation of the university’s leader — a shocking move that reveals the personal animus behind the investigation. The administration would rather oust a leader than force compliance with a particular policy.\n\n\nWhy? By law, the university and all state agencies are represented by the attorney general of Virginia. The current attorney general has been an outspoken opponent of D.E.I. programs. He joined Virginia’s governor, Glenn Youngkin, in applauding the university’s dismantling of D.E.I. programs in March 2025. This means rather than having an advocate loyal to the university and its interests, Mr. Ryan and the university were saddled with counsel aligned with the other side.\n\n\nThe university’s governing board took a similar position. The majority of the current board was appointed by Mr. Youngkin, who has said, “D.E.I. is done at the University of Virginia.” In failing to assert these valid legal defenses, the board abdicated its responsibility to protect the university and defend it against unfounded allegations.\n\n\nMr. Ryan was known to urge the university to be both “great and good” in all its endeavors. His departure will result in a less inclusive university community, which will harm all students who choose the University of Virginia. It is a sad day for the university, which will suffer the consequences of this bad decision.\n\n\nNew York City Tech/CUNY one of the highlighted BA degree granting institutions whose faculty are increasingly integrated—race/ethnicity non-white.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-is-the-share-of-minority-instructors-at-colleges-with-the-most-full-time-faculty-members\n(VAC says: This interesting graph explains too the attacks from this fed administration on higher ed)\n\n\n\nWhat a Harvard Deal Would Mean for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/what-a-harvard-deal-would-mean-for-higher-ed\n\nIn the absence of more information, some faculty members within Harvard are fearful that the government isn’t negotiating in good faith, and that any agreement would only open the door to an unlawful power grab — although not everyone is so pessimistic.

Garber, on Monday, officials from four federal agencies said that the university was “in violent violation of Title VI,” a portion of federal civil rights law that bars discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin. In recent years, government officials have interpreted the provision to include “shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics” as within the law’s protections.\n\n\nIn their letter, the Trump administration officials said that Harvard’s “commitment to racial hierarchies” had “enabled antisemitism to fester” at the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university. They warned that not making “adequate changes immediately will result in the loss of all federal financial resources and continue to affect Harvard’s relationship with the federal government.”\n\n\nHarvard sharply disputed the government’s account, saying in a statement on Monday that antisemitism was “a serious problem” that the school had taken significant steps to address. The university added that it was “far from indifferent on this issue” and that it “strongly disagrees with the government’s findings.”\n\n\nBut Paula M. Stannard, the director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a separate letter on Monday that Harvard’s varied steps to combat antisemitism, such as the development of a faculty panel to investigate and discipline people in connection with certain accusations of misconduct, were “too little, too late.”\n\n\nAccording to Ms. Stannard, “Jewish and Israeli students at Harvard University were subject to severe, pervasive and objectively offensive harassment from Oct. 7, 2023, through the present.”\n\n(Add Paula M Stannard to your bingo card)\n\nThe Trump administration found Harvard violated the civil rights of Jewish and Israeli students, putting the university’s federal funding further at risk\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-violated-students-civil-rights-trump-administration-finds-4a0ed7aa?st=UNno8L&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nA formal “notice of violation” of civil-rights law generally is a step that can come before either a lawsuit from the Justice Department or a voluntary resolution with the school.

Can it survive a Trump standoff?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/01/harvard-trump-federal-funding/\n\n“With its resources and an AAA bond rating, Harvard has financial freedom and flexibility. Still, these headwinds, and there are a lot of them, are piling up all at once,” said Howard Bunsis, an accounting professor at Eastern Michigan University.\n\n\nSince the federal government began demanding the university change how it operates in April, Harvard has lost more than $2 billion in federal funding.\n\n\nBut the university has limited access to its endowment and already depends on it for a significant portion of its operating budget. And about 80 percent of Harvard’s endowment, a collection of 14,000 funds, is restricted to uses that donors stipulate, and the university cannot change the terms of those gifts — some dating back to the founding of the school — on its own.\n\n\nHarvard has about $8.2 billion in unfunded private equity commitments coming due in the near term, said Michael Markov, co-founder and chairman of the research firm Markov Processes International. Finding the money to cover those kinds of commitments could put tremendous pressure on universities with large private equity stakes, he said.\n\n\n“It’s just this perfect storm of academic freedom in the crosshairs at the same time that the universities are vulnerable because of the financial uncertainties associated with their endowments and their private equity investments,” he [Philip Casey, founder and chief executive of Institutional LPs] said.\n\n\nHarvard would face a budget shortfall of about a billion dollars a year if President Trump follows through on all of his plans and threats spanning research funding, tax policy and student enrollment\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-trump-funding-budget-cuts-1dc5bf2f?st=H5Jdr2&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(Has an excellent graphic “Harvard’s 2024 revenue and worst-case scenario losses” showing losses: -240M for endowment (of 2.4B), -700M federally funded research (max amount), -110M grad school (of 800M) )\n\nHarvard University would face a budget shortfall of about a billion dollars a year if President Trump follows through on all of his plans and threats spanning research funding, tax policy and student enrollment, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\nThat grim math helps explain why Harvard has taken steps toward negotiating with the administration after months of defiance. The Journal’s estimate, based on publicly available data, is for a worst-case scenario in which Harvard loses all federal research funding, federal student aid and its ability to enroll international students, and Congress hikes its annual endowment tax to 8%.\n\n\n\n\n\nMiddle States Gives Columbia a Warning\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/02/columbia-u-gets-warning-accreditor\n\nThe Middle States Commission on Higher Education warned Columbia University that its accreditation could be in jeopardy.\n\n\nThe warning, sent June 26, comes after the Education Department pressured the accreditor in early June to take action against Columbia. The Trump administration has said that Columbia violated federal civil rights laws and is thus out of compliance with the accreditor’s standards. But only accreditors can say whether a college is in compliance. Middle States had already opened a review of Columbia before the department’s notice, conducting an on-site evaluation in April.\n\n\nMiddle States said in the warning that it doesn’t have sufficient evidence showing Columbia is complying with its standard on ethics and integrity. The criteria for that standard includes “a climate that fosters respect among students, faculty, staff, and administration from a range of diverse backgrounds, ideas, and perspectives” and “compliance with all applicable government laws and regulations.” The accreditor requested a monitoring report, due by Nov. 3, that demonstrates the university’s compliance with the standard, and will consider Columbia’s accreditation status at a March 2026 meeting. Columbia remains accredited in the meantime.\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Cyberattack Appears Politically Motivated, University Says\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/nyregion/columbia-university-hacker.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(trigger alert; graphic image accompanies article)\n\nThe cyberattack that caused a widespread shutdown of Columbia University’s computer systems last week appears to be the work of a “hacktivist” — a hacker who also stole student data with the apparent goal of furthering a political agenda, a Columbia official said on Tuesday.\n\n\nA cyber-forensics firm hired by the university reported that the hack appeared to be highly sophisticated and targeted in its theft of documents, the official said. The official added that Columbia had not yet determined the scope of the data theft and that it could take weeks to months to do so. Columbia’s websites and internal systems, however, which went down during the attack, were up and running again within a week.\n\n\nThe person who communicated with Bloomberg News provided it with 1.6 gigabytes of data representing 2.5 million student applications to Columbia dating back decades. The data included students’ and applicants’ university-issued identification numbers, their citizenship status, the decisions made on their applications and the academic programs to which they applied, among other information.\n\n\nBloomberg reported that it was able to confirm the accuracy of the data for eight Columbia students and alumni who applied to the university between 2019 and 2024.\n\n\nColumbia was attacked about a week after its chief information officer, Gaspare LoDuca, announced that he was leaving the university and joining M.I.T. as its vice president for information systems and technology. Over his 10-year tenure at Columbia, Mr. LoDuca oversaw all information technology systems, including cybersecurity, The Columbia Spectator reported.\n\n\nColumbia University plans to steal a page from the conservative playbook\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/07/02/states-climate-law-model-legislation/\n\n“States are the front line for climate action in this moment of the second Trump administration.

Thanks VAC for sharing.)\n\nIndiana’s public higher education institutions plan to eliminate or consolidate over 400 programs, equaling roughly one-fifth of their degree offerings statewide, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education said Monday. The announcement came just before a new state law took effect Tuesday setting minimum requirements for how many graduates individual programs must produce at the universities and Ivy Tech Community College, or face termination.\n\n\nRepublican state legislators passed the law—a state budget bill with major higher education provisions tacked on—less than two days after revealing it in April. It says institutions can ask the commission for approval to keep offering degrees that don’t meet the threshold of average annual graduates. But the universities “voluntarily submitted” the first wave of hundreds of programs to be ended or consolidated, the commission said, meaning they didn’t ask for exemptions.\n\n\nAccording to a list posted by the commission, among the 400 degrees to be nixed or combined into others are many foreign language and teacher-education programs. The list also includes undergraduate and graduate degrees in fine arts, English, business, economics, philosophy, history, anthropology, sociology, journalism, public administration, social work, labor studies, political science, American studies, Africana studies, women’s and gender studies, religious studies, and classical studies.\n\n\nSTEM and medical disciplines aren’t being spared, either; the eliminated or consolidated degrees include some in health, biology, chemistry, math, computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. Indiana University at Bloomington, for instance, is ending its Ph.D. in astrophysics. More than half the programs to be eliminated or merged are in the IU system. Vincennes University is the only public institution in the state that didn’t “voluntarily” submit programs to be cut or combined.\n\n\nIndiana’s program slashing can be seen as another consequence of the broader push by red states’ legislatures to intervene in higher education by restricting teaching, attacking tenure and, now, dictating curricula.\n\n\nHeather Akou, the president-elect of the IU Bloomington Faculty Council, said the council didn’t get to vote on these “draconian” cuts and mergers at the flagship campus. “Not only did we not vote, we were not even consulted with,” Akou said.\n\n\nBalthaser, the IU South Bend AAUP member, said, “This was done very intentionally to essentially change the mission of the university—to shrink it, to essentially destroy what we understand as the public [land-grant] university.”\n\n\n\n\n\nUPenn Agrees to Ban Transgender Athletes in Women’s Sports, Correct Records | National Review\n\nhttps://www.nationalreview.com/news/upenn-agrees-to-ban-transgender-athletes-in-womens-sports-correct-records/\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/01/penn-agrees-trumps-demands-will-strip-trans-athletes?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed&utm_campaign=e64fe0d91e-DNU_2021_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1fcbc04421-e64fe0d91e-236791398&mc_cid=e64fe0d91e&mc_eid=7f06c26dc8#\n(From VAC)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/us/penn-title-ix-transgender-swimmer-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania said on Tuesday that it had struck a deal with the federal government that will limit how transgender people may participate in its athletic programs, bowing to the Trump administration’s new interpretation of the law that bans sex discrimination in education.\n\n\nThe agreement was tied to a civil rights investigation, conducted by the Department of Education, of a transgender woman’s participation on Penn’s women’s swim team three years ago. In April, the Education Department said that Penn’s support for the swimmer, Lia Thomas, had violated the law governing sex discrimination in most educational settings.\n\n\nPenn’s president, J. Larry Jameson, noted in a statement on Tuesday that the university had been in compliance with the interpretation of federal law that was in effect when Ms. Thomas swam there. But he said that the Trump administration’s inquiry had left Penn vulnerable to “significant and lasting implications,” a reference to the possibility of a loss of federal funding.\n\n\n\n\n\nUVirginia President resigns under pressure from Trump DOJ\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/27/us/politics/university-of-virginia-president-resigns-trump-justice-department.html\n(Thanks VAC, who is counting scalps)\n\nThe University of Virginia’s president, James E.

This was an excruciatingly difficult decision, and I am heartbroken to be leaving this way.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nJim Ryan, President\n\n(The pressure was on in at least three areas: research funding, student financial aid, or student visas).\n\nThe Unexpected Trump Target\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/the-unexpected-trump-target\n\nRyan’s ouster has turned UVa into an unexpected battlefield in the Trump administration’s political assault on colleges. For months, officials have wielded federal power to rebalance what they see as higher ed’s extreme leftward tilt and stamp out diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.\n\n\nHarmeet K. Dhillon, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, sees things differently. Ryan “has built his entire career on what was the academic vogue, which is DEI. Now, it isn’t,” she told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “And so I think it is time for new leadership that’s willing to comply with federal law.”\n\n\nOther faculty members see Ryan’s decision as a submission to political actors who have no inclination or tendency to compromise. The professors wish that Ryan, or the university, had fought back. Deborah McDowell, a professor of English, thinks Ryan should have forced the board to fire him.\n\n\n“Capitulation is sometimes in order,” she said. “For this, I don’t think it was. This is spoken as someone who does not agree and would not represent myself as one in full agreement with the decisions Ryan has made throughout his presidency. I am not. But bullies cannot be placated. They are greedy.”\n\n\nThe targeting of UVa may seem somewhat arbitrary, the result of a random commonality in the curricula vitae of two of the nation’s top civil-rights officials. In May, The Chronicle reported a story teasing out the connections between Dhillon; her deputy, Gregory Brown, who attended UVa as an undergraduate and has sued the institution in the past over a civil-rights issue; the Jefferson Council, the conservative alumni group that has been calling on Ryan to resign for months; and the Board of Visitors.\n\n\nLetters from DOJ reveal threats to U.Va. over admissions policies, Ryan’s leadership - The Cavalier Daily - University of Virginia’s Student Newspaper\n\nhttps://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/07/letters-from-doj-reveal-threats-to-uva-over-admissions-policies-ryans-leadership\n\nBetween April 11 and June 17, the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division sent seven letters to University officials, according to documents obtained by The Cavalier Daily through a Freedom of information Act request.\n\n\nIn these letters, the Justice Department sought confirmation that the University had removed affirmative action from its admissions policies and had ended Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives. Some letters also alleged that the University had failed to protect students against antisemitism. The letters did not confirm whether or not the Justice Department’s demands had been met.\n\n\nApril 11: The first letter was sent by the Justice Department to the University April 11 and requested information regarding the University’s admissions policies. The Justice Department said it aimed to ensure the University was no longer using affirmative action, in accordance with the Supreme Court’s decision in Students for Fair Admissions vs. Harvard in 2023.\n\n\nThe letter requested, among other documents, all admissions data broken down by race and ethnicity for the past five academic years, including applicant test scores, GPA, extracurricular activities, essays and admissions outcomes. It also requested that the University verify that race was not used as a factor in determining any scholarship or financial aid awards to students.\n\n\nJune 17: The final letter turned up in the FOIA request was from June 17. “Time is running short, and the Department’s patience is wearing thin,” the letter read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope is wooing American researchers with funding as the Trump administration cancels grants\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/world/europe/europe-is-recruiting-academics-disenchanted-with-america-c4bae422?st=XUZ7ic&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(Now an evergreen story…)\n\nMoody’s Warns of Credit Risk for Colleges Reliant on International Enrollment\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/07/03/drops-international-student-tuition-could-pose\n(CUNY Enrollment doesn’t seem to be impacted as of now; Baruch, City, and GC are trending a bit above last year at the moment.)\n\nThose most at risk include the 11 percent of American institutions where international students make up more than 20 percent of the student body, the ratings agency said, as well as institutions that are already struggling financially. (In total, 6 percent of students at U.S. institutions come from other countries.)\n\n\n“The reduction in international students presents a credit risk for universities heavily reliant on this demographic because of potential declines in tuition income, as international students typically pay full tuition fees,” the report states. “Additionally, with declining numbers of high school students over the next several years in the U.S. leading to fewer domestic students, universities intending to fill the gap with more international students may fall short.”\n\n\nNobelist: U.S. Scientists Took Support ‘For Granted’ Before Trump Cuts\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/07/03/nobelist-scientists-took-support-granted-trump\n\nFrances Arnold, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018 for her work on engineering enzymes, told an audience of young scientists in Germany that the “utter chaos” in U.S. politics of recent months, which has seen billions of dollars removed from scientific research, might be viewed in terms of a wider failure to communicate the value of scientific discovery.\n\n\n“Never take for granted that scientific achievement is celebrated—we took it for granted, and for far too long, and we are paying the price,” Arnold told the June 29 opening ceremony of the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting, an annual conference that brings together Nobel laureates and early-career researchers.\n\n\nScientists warn US will lose a generation of talent because of Trump cuts\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/03/national-science-foundation-trump-cuts\n\nThe scientists warn that Trump’s assault on diversity in science is already eroding the quality of fundamental research funded at the NSF, the premier federal investor in basic science and engineering, which threatens to derail advances in tackling existential threats to food, water and biodiversity in the US.\n\n\n“Before Trump, the review process was based on merit and impact. Now, it’s like rolling the dice because a Doge person has the final say,” said one current program officer. “There has never in the history of NSF been anything like this. It’s disgusting what we’re being instructed to do.”\n\n\nTrump’s big, beautiful bill calls for a 56% cut to the current $9bn NSF budget, as well as a 73% reduction in staff and fellowships – with graduate students among the hardest hit.\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve estimates that government-supported research from the NSF and other agencies has had a return on investment of 150% to 300% over the past 75 years, meaning US taxpayers have gotten back between $1.50 and $3 for every dollar invested.\n\n(There is a great graphic titled “Democratic states have had more NSF grants cancelled” and the numbers are 917M in blue states; 583 in red – which is a bit misleading, because TX is the 3rd hardest hit; GA in top part)\n(There is another great graphic on cuts by institution titled “Harvard NSF grants account for 10% of all cancellations, by budget”)\n\nThe sweeping cuts to the NSF come on top of Trump’s dismantling of other key scientific research departments within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Agriculture (USDA) and US Geological Service (USGS).\n\n\nTrump’s big, beautiful bill cuts the USGS budget by 39%. This includes slashing the entire budget for the agency’s ecosystems mission area (EMA), which leads federal research on species & ecosystems and houses the climate adaptation science centers.\n\n\nNIH cuts: Red states losing out as canceled grants are reinstated:\n\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2025/07/03/nih-cuts-grant-restoration-complicated-by-limits-to-court-order-trump-dei-restrictions/\n\nAfter the first grant termination rolled into Professor Cheri Levinson’s inbox, her university told her it wasn’t worth taking the time to appeal the decision; the odds of success were too low. Ultimately, she had three National Institutes of Health grants terminated that were meant to support trainees from diverse backgrounds in her lab studying eating disorders at the University of Louisville.\n\n\nBut her state’s Republican attorney general didn’t join AGs from other states, most of them blue states, who sued the Trump administration to block the grant cancellations. So two weeks ago, when many researchers exhaled in relief as a federal judge ruled that a wide swath of the terminations were illegal, and ordered them reinstated, Levinson wasn’t one of them.\n\n(In blue states 2.1B reinstated; in red states 62M)\n\n\n\n“Disaster Looms”: Justice Jackson’s Warning for the Country – Mother Jones\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/06/injunctions-supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson/\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a president who wanted to be king. His Congress was acquiescent. The high court approved. But lower federal courts held firm to the rule of law. Time and again, they blocked the president from seizing power and violating the nation’s laws. So the president turned to the justices on the Supreme Court for a favor: please stop these meddlesome little courts from getting in my way. And then one day in June, the Supreme Court granted his wish.\n\n\nThis is what happened on Friday in a case about birthright citizenship before the United States Supreme Court. The Trump administration’s blatantly unconstitutional executive order from January denying birthright citizenship to the children of certain classes of immigrants quickly ran up against lower court judges, who prohibited the Trump administration from violating one of the country’s most sacred Constitutional rights.\n\n\n“The Court’s decision is nothing less than an open invitation for the Government to bypass the Constitution,” Sotomayor warned. “The Executive Branch can now enforce policies that flout settled law and violate countless individuals’ constitutional rights, and the federal courts will be hamstrung to stop its actions fully.”\n\n\nJackson warns, this decision has altered our system of government and, sooner or later, may destroy it. “Disaster looms,” she warns. If a court cannot command the executive to follow the law, then there exists “a zone of lawlessness within which the Executive has the prerogative to take or leave the law as it wishes, and where individuals who would otherwise be entitled to the law’s protection become subject to the Executive’s whims instead.”\n\n\n“In this country, the Executive does not stand above or outside of the law,” Jackson writes. But her dissent is also a warning that this is becoming less true. A year ago, the Republican appointees exempted the president from the dictates of criminal law. Now, it suggests that even if a court finds the administration’s actions illegal or unconstitutional, it can continue to enforce them against those who haven’t challenged the action in court, either individually or as part of a class action. As a result, the president rises beyond the bounds of the law, and individuals slip from the embrace of its protection.\n\n\n“I have no doubt that, if judges must allow the Executive to act unlawfully in some circumstances, as the Court concludes today, executive lawlessness will flourish, and from there, it is not difficult to predict how this all ends,” Jackson wrote. “Eventually, executive power will become completely uncontainable, and our beloved constitutional Republic will be no more.”\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: A.I.

    "text": "A different take on academic freedom.\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/07/02/university-autonomy-stems-corporate-rights-opinion\n(Thanks BE for sharing)\n\nRather than an individual right, academic freedom is, properly understood, what Stanley Fish called “a guild concept.” More specifically, it is a concept belonging to the incorporated guild of professors and students (and others). This theory bases academic freedom not on freedom of speech—a troublesome basis for academic freedom—but on the university’s corporate rights. These corporate rights, not infrequently finding expression in constitutions, are also sometimes constitutional rights. By substituting corporate rights for freedom of speech, we turn a foundation of sand into stone.\n\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that, in spring 2025, we may have entered the nadir of American academic freedom. Austin Sarat rightfully urged us, even before then, to find new ways to guard academic freedom “against external threats.” Now, in the face of ongoing hostility from both state and federal governments, it is imperative that universities deploy the full range of arguments at their disposal, including those based on their forgotten corporate rights. In other words, it’s time for universities to invoke their corporate rights. Allow me to explain.\n\n\n“Incorporation,” David Ciepley has written, “is a powerful tool.” Corporations can sue and be sued in their own names, hold property, enter contracts, use their own seals and legislate. Importantly, the university’s corporateness bears no necessary relationship to its current autocratic constitution, whereby, according to Timothy V. Kaufman-Osborn, universities are “ruled by external lay governing boards vested with the panoply of powers customarily granted to corporations, including the power to adopt, amend, and revoke its basic rules of institutional governance.” Thus, we can use the university’s corporateness to rebuff external attacks, while also working, as Arjun Appadurai wrote recently, “to break the unilateral power of boards of trustees.”\n\n\n\n\necretly Recorded by Anti-DEI Group, ‘No Longer Employed’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/2025/06/30/secretly-recorded-anti-dei-group-now-no-longer-employed\n\nhe YouTube video is titled “CAUGHT ON TAPE: UNC Administrator Admits They Ignore DEI Ban.” Heart-pumping music plays. A hidden camera records a Black woman—labeled in the video as Janique Sanders, a University of North Carolina at Charlotte employee—speaking to people out of frame.\n\n\nThe woman apparently didn’t know she was speaking to someone doing their own covert work: the conservative group Accuracy in Media, or AIM [which opposes the scientific consensus on climate change], conducting a sting. Now Sanders, who was assistant director of the Office of Leadership and Community Engagement, is no longer employed by UNC Charlotte.\n\n\nWhere Anti-DEI Legislation Has Been Proposed\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/here-are-the-states-where-lawmakers-are-seeking-to-ban-colleges-dei-efforts\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nNYTimes: Trump Withholds Nearly $7 Billion for Schools, With Little Explanation\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/us/trump-education-funds.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(K-12, but still just reneging)\n\nThe Trump administration has declined to release nearly $7 billion in federal funding that helps pay for after-school and summer programs, support for students learning English, teacher training and other services.\n\n\nThe money was expected to be released by Tuesday. But in an email on Monday, the Education Department notified state education agencies that the money would not be available.\n\n\nMany school districts also rely on federal dollars to help non-English-speaking students and families, including training teachers and hiring translators.\n\n\nA Decades-Old Government Program That Supports Hispanic Students Is Under Fresh Scrutiny\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/a-decades-old-government-program-for-supporting-hispanic-students-is-under-fresh-scrutiny\n\nFor 30 years, colleges enrolling a certain share of Hispanic students have been able to secure a title that opens up millions in federal funding. Hundreds of them now qualify as Hispanic-serving institutions, or HSIs.\n\n\nBut those programs are now in the line of fire.\n\n\nThe U.S. Education Department doled out about $350 million to Hispanic-serving institutions in the 2024 fiscal year across three competitive grant programs; the National Science Foundation awarded another $53.5 million. Colleges can become eligible when at least 25 percent of their undergraduate students identify as Hispanic or Latino/a.\n\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions, the group responsible for the lawsuit that ended race-conscious admissions policies at selective colleges in 2023, has brought a new complaint in Tennessee arguing that federal funding designated solely for HSIs is discriminatory.",

    "text": "DOGE loses control over government grants website, freeing up billions\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/27/doge-loses-control-federal-grants/\n\nThree months ago, DOGE employees wrested control of a key federal grants website, grants.gov, which serves as a clearinghouse for more than $500 billion in annual awards, The Post reported. For most of the program’s existence, federal agencies including the Defense Department posted their funding opportunities directly to the site, where thousands of outside organizations could see and apply for them — until April, when DOGE staffers changed the website’s permissions to give themselves power to review and approve all grants across the government.\n\n\nBut on Thursday, federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, according to emails obtained by The Post and the two people, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive situation. The decision follows fears that months of DOGE-linked delays would lead to what critics allege would be the illegal impoundment of federal funds.\n\n\nPSC, higher-ed unions slam federal research funding cuts\n\nhttps://thechiefleader.com/stories/psc-higher-ed-unions-slam-federal-research-funding-cuts,54668\n\nResearchers at the city and state’s public universities affected by cuts to federal grant funding urged the state’s congressional leaders to oppose further cuts to funding proposed in President Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”\n\n\nMembers of the Professional Staff Congress, the New York State United Teachers and other higher-education advocates rallied against the existing and proposed funding reductions outside of the Trump Building at 40 Wall St. Monday.\n\n\nAt the City University of New York, 70 grants worth $17 million in funding have been slashed, which has put 100 jobs at risk, according to the PSC. And at SUNY, there have been $50 million in grant terminations.\n\n\nThe PSC’s president, James Davis, called the cuts to SUNY and CUNY “an outrage,” adding that cuts to research could delay life-saving medical treatments.\n\n\nKathleen Cumiskey, a psychology professor at the College of Staten Island who has worked at CUNY for 22 years, said that a $700,000 National Science Foundation grant for a three-year STEM education program aimed at improving academic outcomes at Hispanic-serving institutions was terminated on May 2, just 20 months into the program’s lifespan.\n\n\n“We believe the decision to terminate our grant was unfair. Unfortunately, under the current administration, it appears that the agency has been redirected in ways that threaten our nation’s scientific discovery and the importance of broad participation in the creation of new knowledge,” Cumiskey said.\n\n\nCity Comptroller Brad Lander joined the researchers, noting that higher education contributes $35 billion to the city’s economy and employs about 140,000 people.\n\n\n\n\nStalled funding, canceled grants: How the NIH crisis is affecting Duke - The Chronicle\n\nhttps://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2025/06/duke-university-national-institutes-of-health-cut-cancel-duke-research-nih-federal-funding-grants-trump-administrations\n\nDuke receives around $1.2 billion in research grants a year, and much of it comes from the NIH. In fiscal year 2024 NIH support totaled $580 million.\n\n\n“Most of the time, that’s a point of pride, a marker of success, but it’s also a point of challenge when that fundamental model is changing. This is what we’re dealing with now,” said Mary Klotman, executive vice president for health affairs and dean of the School of Medicine\n\n\nGrant Watch contains a field for “tagged_words” — which matches words from a list that The New York Times reported could trigger an automatic review of grants — to words used in a grant’s title or abstract. Noam Ross, a computational researcher part of Grant Watch, told The Chronicle that Grant Watch doesn’t know exactly how grants are flagged for termination, but “suspect that these words are part of a search process for selecting them based on [The New York Times article] and other reporting.”\n\n\nThe 15 canceled NIH grants contained flagged words like “expression,” “disability,” “trans” and “systemic.” However, these words were not used in contexts to promote DEI initiatives, although some may have had diversity supplements including the two described below.\n\n\nThe grant that had the word “disability” in its abstract focused on identifying biomechanical and biological factors that lead to early onset osteoarthritis following a partial meniscectomy — a surgical procedure commonly done to remove damaged meniscal tissue following a tear. The grant had over $750,000 remaining in funding at the time of termination.\n\n\nFurthermore, a grant that had both “trans” and “systemic” in its abstract was working toward editing neural circuits by engineering channel proteins to control the point of contact between two neurons. It had around $1.4 million remaining in funding at the time of termination.\n\n\nIn most other cases where “trans” was flagged, the term generally referred to other words with the trans- prefix, such as disease transmission, transgenic genetic material, translational studies or signal transduction.\n\n\nMost notably, the NIH ended Duke’s Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development, which was a $129 million program and a leader in its field. The program was in its sixth year of funding out of seven and was largely expected to be renewed for an additional cycle. Associated funding has not been listed as terminated in federal databases and thus was not included in the Grant Watch data analysis.\n\n\nThe Scientific Research Lost Amid the Trump Administration’s NIH Cuts — ProPublica\n\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/nih-cuts-research-lost-trump/\n\n\n\n\nE.P.A. Employees Are Invited to Adopt Soon-to-Be Homeless Lab Rats - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/climate/epa-lab-rat-zebra-fish-adoption.html\n\nEmployees at the Environmental Protection Agency’s research campus in North Carolina are preparing to take on a new responsibility. Bring home lab rats as pets.\n\n\nOr maybe some zebra fish.\n\n\nBoth animals have long been used at the E.P.A. facility to test the toxicity of chemicals. But as the E.P.A. shuts down its research arm as part of the Trump administration’s deep cuts to government scientific work, the animals need new homes.",

The Senate legislation underwent significant changes in the week leading up to its passage, several of which softened provisions in the House bill that had raised alarms across the sector. The Senate retained the House’s broad plan to raise the endowment tax, for example, but it limited the extent of the hike and opened up loopholes for small institutions.\n\n\nSenators abandoned a House plan to eliminate subsidized federal undergraduate loans. Also out: a House provision that would have required students to take 30 credit hours per academic year to receive the maximum Pell Grant award, and 15 credit hours to be eligible for Pell Grants at all. Community colleges were particularly panicked about the provision.\n\n\nThe Senate kiboshed a controversial risk-sharing plan introduced in the House bill, which would have forced colleges to kick money into a new pot of federal aid when their students defaulted on federal-loan repayment. Instead, it offered an alternative approach with roots in the gainful-employment rule, a cornerstone of the Obama administration’s accountability efforts.\n\n\nThe Senate-passed plan would yank federal-loan eligibility from programs that fail to deliver an earnings bump to their graduates. Senators tweaked the details in the days leading up to Tuesday’s vote so colleges would be judged on the earnings of their graduates, not dropouts.",

    "text": "Why UVA President’s Resignation Could Be a ‘Watershed Moment’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/executive-leadership/2025/06/30/uva-reels-after-president-resigns-under-pressure\n\n“I think this is a watershed moment,” said Jon Holbein, an associate professor of public policy, politics and education at UVA. “If a moderate president at a conservative–for–higher education institution who has followed the law when it comes to diversity [can be pushed out], no president is immune from the Trump administration’s ire.”\n\n\nUVA faculty, some board members, students and community say Ryan’s departure is a blow to the institution. “His loss makes us worse,” said Michael Kennedy, a UVA professor and faculty representative on the Board of Visitors, describing Ryan as a “shattering success.”\n\n\nThe Jefferson Council, a conservative alumni group that publicly called for Ryan’s resignation, called the DEI efforts exclusive, discriminatory and “the new McCarthyism.”\n\n(I think that used to be called doublespeak; this organization seems to have been founded by someone who in March had this news: Youngkin fires Bert Ellis from University of Virginia Board of Visitors))\n\nThe U. of Virginia’s President Was Targeted Over DEI. Now He’s Resigning.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/university-of-virginia-president-reportedly-resigns-under-pressure-from-trump-administration\n\nPeter McDonough, vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education, called the government’s handling of the matter “a potentially ominous effort to control a learning environment it finds objectionable.”\n\n\n“This is unprecedented,” McDonough said in an interview. “Maybe we should have seen it coming.”\n\n\nDhillon said that the department had told UVa representatives that the government “lacked confidence” in Ryan, given his “participation in groups” that had publicly opposed the Trump administration’s policies. (Ryan, along with hundreds of other college presidents, signed a letter condemning “unprecedented government overreach” in higher education.)\n\n\nNYTimes: What the University of Virginia Should Have Done\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/30/opinion/university-of-virginia-doj-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUnder investigation by the Justice Department, the university had a strong defense, if only it had the courage to assert it. Instead of fighting back against what I believe to be false accusations that the university was violating federal law, and the even more outrageous demand that Mr. Ryan resign as a remedy for those alleged violations, the university’s Board of Visitors pushed out a popular president. Instead of presenting facts and law, the board waved the white flag of surrender. Mr. Ryan’s resignation is a victory for intimidation and fear over the rule of law.\n\n\nI served as university counsel at the University of Virginia from 2018 through 2022. During that time, it was my job to defend the university from unfounded allegations and investigations. The Justice Department has alleged that the university’s actions violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which states, “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” Had I been university counsel last week, I would have advised my client to challenge what I believe to be a false allegation that the university’s policies are unlawful.\n\n\nTitle VI prohibits racial classifications, quotas or programs that are exclusive to any one race, gender or protected class. It does not prevent federal contractors, such as universities, from pursuing the goal of creating a diverse community, one that ensures all individuals can participate in the learning environment regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, national origin or political ideology. Eligibility for programs and opportunities based on those and other immutable characteristics is illegal. Programs that create a pipeline of diverse applicants are not.\n\n\nWhile the university’s compliance with Title VI is clear to me, it was challenged by the Justice Department. Informed by the advocacy of the America First Legal Foundation, an organization founded by the current White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, the department alleged that the university’s compliance efforts were insufficient, a mere relabeling of D.E.I. programs that broke the law. The department’s proposed remedy was the resignation of the university’s leader — a shocking move that reveals the personal animus behind the investigation. The administration would rather oust a leader than force compliance with a particular policy.\n\n\nWhy? By law, the university and all state agencies are represented by the attorney general of Virginia. The current attorney general has been an outspoken opponent of D.E.I. programs. He joined Virginia’s governor, Glenn Youngkin, in applauding the university’s dismantling of D.E.I. programs in March 2025. This means rather than having an advocate loyal to the university and its interests, Mr. Ryan and the university were saddled with counsel aligned with the other side.\n\n\nThe university’s governing board took a similar position. The majority of the current board was appointed by Mr. Youngkin, who has said, “D.E.I. is done at the University of Virginia.” In failing to assert these valid legal defenses, the board abdicated its responsibility to protect the university and defend it against unfounded allegations.\n\n\nMr. Ryan was known to urge the university to be both “great and good” in all its endeavors. His departure will result in a less inclusive university community, which will harm all students who choose the University of Virginia. It is a sad day for the university, which will suffer the consequences of this bad decision.\n\n\nNew York City Tech/CUNY one of the highlighted BA degree granting institutions whose faculty are increasingly integrated—race/ethnicity non-white.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-is-the-share-of-minority-instructors-at-colleges-with-the-most-full-time-faculty-members\n(VAC says: This interesting graph explains too the attacks from this fed administration on higher ed)\n\n\n\nWhat a Harvard Deal Would Mean for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/what-a-harvard-deal-would-mean-for-higher-ed\n\nIn the absence of more information, some faculty members within Harvard are fearful that the government isn’t negotiating in good faith, and that any agreement would only open the door to an unlawful power grab — although not everyone is so pessimistic. Outside of Harvard, expert observers of higher education also range between faith in what Harvard could accomplish in a settlement, and worry that any such deal may set a dangerous precedent for the rest of the sector.\n\n\nRyan D. Enos, a professor of government, can’t envision any positive outcomes from settling with the Trump administration. “It’s shortsighted to think that anything good can come from trying to negotiate your way out of extortion with an authoritarian regime,” he says.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration “Finds” Harvard Violated Civil Rights Law\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/30/us/politics/trump-harvard-civil-rights-law.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Okay, quotes in the headline were added as this was never established beyond the walls of the white house)\n\nIn a letter to Harvard’s president, Alan M. Garber, on Monday, officials from four federal agencies said that the university was “in violent violation of Title VI,” a portion of federal civil rights law that bars discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin. In recent years, government officials have interpreted the provision to include “shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics” as within the law’s protections.\n\n\nIn their letter, the Trump administration officials said that Harvard’s “commitment to racial hierarchies” had “enabled antisemitism to fester” at the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university. They warned that not making “adequate changes immediately will result in the loss of all federal financial resources and continue to affect Harvard’s relationship with the federal government.”\n\n\nHarvard sharply disputed the government’s account, saying in a statement on Monday that antisemitism was “a serious problem” that the school had taken significant steps to address. The university added that it was “far from indifferent on this issue” and that it “strongly disagrees with the government’s findings.”\n\n\nBut Paula M. Stannard, the director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a separate letter on Monday that Harvard’s varied steps to combat antisemitism, such as the development of a faculty panel to investigate and discipline people in connection with certain accusations of misconduct, were “too little, too late.”\n\n\nAccording to Ms. Stannard, “Jewish and Israeli students at Harvard University were subject to severe, pervasive and objectively offensive harassment from Oct. 7, 2023, through the present.”\n\n(Add Paula M Stannard to your bingo card)\n\nThe Trump administration found Harvard violated the civil rights of Jewish and Israeli students, putting the university’s federal funding further at risk\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-violated-students-civil-rights-trump-administration-finds-4a0ed7aa?st=UNno8L&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nA formal “notice of violation” of civil-rights law generally is a step that can come before either a lawsuit from the Justice Department or a voluntary resolution with the school. Under past presidential administrations, civil-rights investigations at universities usually ended with voluntary resolution agreements.\n\n\nWhat a Harvard Deal Would Mean for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-a-harvard-deal-would-mean-for-higher-ed\n(Thanks VAC for sending along; this )\n\nIf Harvard reverses course, it would compromise that sense of common cause. “There will be a certain feeling of betrayal if they make a deal,” according to Levitsky [professor of Latin American studies].\n\n\nRyan D. Enos, a professor of government, can’t envision any positive outcomes from settling with the Trump administration. “It’s shortsighted to think that anything good can come from trying to negotiate your way out of extortion with an authoritarian regime,” he says.\n\n\nHarvard is the wealthiest U.S. university. Can it survive a Trump standoff?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/01/harvard-trump-federal-funding/\n\n“With its resources and an AAA bond rating, Harvard has financial freedom and flexibility. Still, these headwinds, and there are a lot of them, are piling up all at once,” said Howard Bunsis, an accounting professor at Eastern Michigan University.\n\n\nSince the federal government began demanding the university change how it operates in April, Harvard has lost more than $2 billion in federal funding.\n\n\nBut the university has limited access to its endowment and already depends on it for a significant portion of its operating budget. And about 80 percent of Harvard’s endowment, a collection of 14,000 funds, is restricted to uses that donors stipulate, and the university cannot change the terms of those gifts — some dating back to the founding of the school — on its own.\n\n\nHarvard has about $8.2 billion in unfunded private equity commitments coming due in the near term, said Michael Markov, co-founder and chairman of the research firm Markov Processes International. Finding the money to cover those kinds of commitments could put tremendous pressure on universities with large private equity stakes, he said.\n\n\n“It’s just this perfect storm of academic freedom in the crosshairs at the same time that the universities are vulnerable because of the financial uncertainties associated with their endowments and their private equity investments,” he [Philip Casey, founder and chief executive of Institutional LPs] said.\n\n\nHarvard would face a budget shortfall of about a billion dollars a year if President Trump follows through on all of his plans and threats spanning research funding, tax policy and student enrollment\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-trump-funding-budget-cuts-1dc5bf2f?st=H5Jdr2&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(Has an excellent graphic “Harvard’s 2024 revenue and worst-case scenario losses” showing losses: -240M for endowment (of 2.4B), -700M federally funded research (max amount), -110M grad school (of 800M) )\n\nHarvard University would face a budget shortfall of about a billion dollars a year if President Trump follows through on all of his plans and threats spanning research funding, tax policy and student enrollment, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\nThat grim math helps explain why Harvard has taken steps toward negotiating with the administration after months of defiance. The Journal’s estimate, based on publicly available data, is for a worst-case scenario in which Harvard loses all federal research funding, federal student aid and its ability to enroll international students, and Congress hikes its annual endowment tax to 8%.\n\n\n\n\n\nMiddle States Gives Columbia a Warning\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/02/columbia-u-gets-warning-accreditor\n\nThe Middle States Commission on Higher Education warned Columbia University that its accreditation could be in jeopardy.\n\n\nThe warning, sent June 26, comes after the Education Department pressured the accreditor in early June to take action against Columbia. The Trump administration has said that Columbia violated federal civil rights laws and is thus out of compliance with the accreditor’s standards. But only accreditors can say whether a college is in compliance. Middle States had already opened a review of Columbia before the department’s notice, conducting an on-site evaluation in April.\n\n\nMiddle States said in the warning that it doesn’t have sufficient evidence showing Columbia is complying with its standard on ethics and integrity. The criteria for that standard includes “a climate that fosters respect among students, faculty, staff, and administration from a range of diverse backgrounds, ideas, and perspectives” and “compliance with all applicable government laws and regulations.” The accreditor requested a monitoring report, due by Nov. 3, that demonstrates the university’s compliance with the standard, and will consider Columbia’s accreditation status at a March 2026 meeting. Columbia remains accredited in the meantime.\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Cyberattack Appears Politically Motivated, University Says\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/nyregion/columbia-university-hacker.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(trigger alert; graphic image accompanies article)\n\nThe cyberattack that caused a widespread shutdown of Columbia University’s computer systems last week appears to be the work of a “hacktivist” — a hacker who also stole student data with the apparent goal of furthering a political agenda, a Columbia official said on Tuesday.\n\n\nA cyber-forensics firm hired by the university reported that the hack appeared to be highly sophisticated and targeted in its theft of documents, the official said. The official added that Columbia had not yet determined the scope of the data theft and that it could take weeks to months to do so. Columbia’s websites and internal systems, however, which went down during the attack, were up and running again within a week.\n\n\nThe person who communicated with Bloomberg News provided it with 1.6 gigabytes of data representing 2.5 million student applications to Columbia dating back decades. The data included students’ and applicants’ university-issued identification numbers, their citizenship status, the decisions made on their applications and the academic programs to which they applied, among other information.\n\n\nBloomberg reported that it was able to confirm the accuracy of the data for eight Columbia students and alumni who applied to the university between 2019 and 2024.\n\n\nColumbia was attacked about a week after its chief information officer, Gaspare LoDuca, announced that he was leaving the university and joining M.I.T. as its vice president for information systems and technology. Over his 10-year tenure at Columbia, Mr. LoDuca oversaw all information technology systems, including cybersecurity, The Columbia Spectator reported.\n\n\nColumbia University plans to steal a page from the conservative playbook\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/07/02/states-climate-law-model-legislation/\n\n“States are the front line for climate action in this moment of the second Trump administration. And one of the key needs that state legislators have is legal support for writing better laws,” said Vanessa Fajans-Turner, executive director of Environmental Advocates New York, which is also funding the initiative. “We see climate legislation ending up very consistently in the courts, being challenged. And if that is going to be the case, we need to start writing legislation with the strongest possible legal basis.”\n\n\nThe acting president of Columbia University apologized Wednesday for messages in which she appeared to diminish concerns about antisemitism on campus and criticize a Jewish member of the school’s board of trustees\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-president-claire-shipman-apology-3cd70dc5?st=W8PktJ&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nStefanik tweeted out a one-word message above a picture of Claire Shipman, the school’s acting president: “Resign.”\n\n\nIn one string of messages Shipman criticized Shoshana Shendelman, an outspoken Jewish trustee, and said she should not be on the board. In a 2023 exchange, the vice chair of the board asked Shipman: “Do you believe that [Shendelman] is a mole?” Shipman said she believed she was and added that she was “so, so tired” of her.\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Public Universities to ‘Voluntarily’ End 19% of Degrees\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/curriculum/2025/07/02/ind-public-universities-voluntarily-ending-19-degrees\n(Their quotes, not mine. Thanks VAC for sharing.)\n\nIndiana’s public higher education institutions plan to eliminate or consolidate over 400 programs, equaling roughly one-fifth of their degree offerings statewide, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education said Monday. The announcement came just before a new state law took effect Tuesday setting minimum requirements for how many graduates individual programs must produce at the universities and Ivy Tech Community College, or face termination.\n\n\nRepublican state legislators passed the law—a state budget bill with major higher education provisions tacked on—less than two days after revealing it in April. It says institutions can ask the commission for approval to keep offering degrees that don’t meet the threshold of average annual graduates. But the universities “voluntarily submitted” the first wave of hundreds of programs to be ended or consolidated, the commission said, meaning they didn’t ask for exemptions.\n\n\nAccording to a list posted by the commission, among the 400 degrees to be nixed or combined into others are many foreign language and teacher-education programs. The list also includes undergraduate and graduate degrees in fine arts, English, business, economics, philosophy, history, anthropology, sociology, journalism, public administration, social work, labor studies, political science, American studies, Africana studies, women’s and gender studies, religious studies, and classical studies.\n\n\nSTEM and medical disciplines aren’t being spared, either; the eliminated or consolidated degrees include some in health, biology, chemistry, math, computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. Indiana University at Bloomington, for instance, is ending its Ph.D. in astrophysics. More than half the programs to be eliminated or merged are in the IU system. Vincennes University is the only public institution in the state that didn’t “voluntarily” submit programs to be cut or combined.\n\n\nIndiana’s program slashing can be seen as another consequence of the broader push by red states’ legislatures to intervene in higher education by restricting teaching, attacking tenure and, now, dictating curricula.\n\n\nHeather Akou, the president-elect of the IU Bloomington Faculty Council, said the council didn’t get to vote on these “draconian” cuts and mergers at the flagship campus. “Not only did we not vote, we were not even consulted with,” Akou said.\n\n\nBalthaser, the IU South Bend AAUP member, said, “This was done very intentionally to essentially change the mission of the university—to shrink it, to essentially destroy what we understand as the public [land-grant] university.”\n\n\n\n\n\nUPenn Agrees to Ban Transgender Athletes in Women’s Sports, Correct Records | National Review\n\nhttps://www.nationalreview.com/news/upenn-agrees-to-ban-transgender-athletes-in-womens-sports-correct-records/\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/01/penn-agrees-trumps-demands-will-strip-trans-athletes?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed&utm_campaign=e64fe0d91e-DNU_2021_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1fcbc04421-e64fe0d91e-236791398&mc_cid=e64fe0d91e&mc_eid=7f06c26dc8#\n(From VAC)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/us/penn-title-ix-transgender-swimmer-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania said on Tuesday that it had struck a deal with the federal government that will limit how transgender people may participate in its athletic programs, bowing to the Trump administration’s new interpretation of the law that bans sex discrimination in education.\n\n\nThe agreement was tied to a civil rights investigation, conducted by the Department of Education, of a transgender woman’s participation on Penn’s women’s swim team three years ago. In April, the Education Department said that Penn’s support for the swimmer, Lia Thomas, had violated the law governing sex discrimination in most educational settings.\n\n\nPenn’s president, J. Larry Jameson, noted in a statement on Tuesday that the university had been in compliance with the interpretation of federal law that was in effect when Ms. Thomas swam there. But he said that the Trump administration’s inquiry had left Penn vulnerable to “significant and lasting implications,” a reference to the possibility of a loss of federal funding.\n\n\n\n\n\nUVirginia President resigns under pressure from Trump DOJ\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/27/us/politics/university-of-virginia-president-resigns-trump-justice-department.html\n(Thanks VAC, who is counting scalps)\n\nThe University of Virginia’s president, James E. Ryan, has told the board overseeing the school that he will resign in the face of demands by the Trump administration that he step aside to help resolve a Justice Department inquiry into the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, according to three people briefed on the matter.\n\n\nFor the leader of one of the nation’s most prominent public universities to take such an extraordinary step demonstrates President Trump’s success in harnessing the investigative powers of the federal government to accomplish his administration’s policy goals.\n\n(Harnessing = weaponizing by another name to this group: Gregory Brown, Harmeet Dhillon, Stephen Miller)\n\nThe University of Virginia has been considered among the top five public universities for more than two decades, according to U.S. News & World Report rankings, and has maintained that position during Mr. Ryan’s tenure. This year, the Princeton Review ranked the university as the second-best value among all public colleges. Last year, Time magazine ranked the college as the fourth-best public school at producing future leaders.\n\n(WSJ reporting)\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/uva-president-resigns-james-ryan-dei-trump-d02a60fe?st=Ce97ks&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(The letter Ryan sent to the University)\n\nTo the University community:\n\n\nI am writing, with a very heavy heart, to let you know that I have submitted my resignation as President of the University of Virginia. To make a long story short, I am inclined to fight for what I believe in, and I believe deeply in this University. But I cannot make a unilateral decision to fight the federal government in order to save my own job.\n\n\nTo do so would not only be quixotic but appear selfish and self-centered to the hundreds of employees who would lose their jobs, the researchers who would lose their funding, and the hundreds of students who could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld.\n\n\nThis is especially true because I had decided that next year would be my last, for reasons entirely separate from this episode-including the fact that we concluded our capital campaign and have implemented nearly all of the major initiatives in our strategic plan.\n\n\nWhile there are very important principles at play here, I would at a very practical level be fighting to keep my job for one more year while knowingly and willingly sacrificing others in this community. If this were not so distinctly tied to me personally, I may have pursued a different path. But I could not in good conscience cause real and direct harm to my colleagues and our students in order to preserve my own position.\n\n\nIt has been an honor to be your President. Thanks for the outpouring of support over the last few days and weeks.\n\n\nMy deepest gratitude to all of the faculty, staff, students, and alumni, who make this University and this community both great and good. This was an excruciatingly difficult decision, and I am heartbroken to be leaving this way.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nJim Ryan, President\n\n(The pressure was on in at least three areas: research funding, student financial aid, or student visas).\n\nThe Unexpected Trump Target\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/the-unexpected-trump-target\n\nRyan’s ouster has turned UVa into an unexpected battlefield in the Trump administration’s political assault on colleges. For months, officials have wielded federal power to rebalance what they see as higher ed’s extreme leftward tilt and stamp out diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.\n\n\nHarmeet K. Dhillon, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, sees things differently. Ryan “has built his entire career on what was the academic vogue, which is DEI. Now, it isn’t,” she told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “And so I think it is time for new leadership that’s willing to comply with federal law.”\n\n\nOther faculty members see Ryan’s decision as a submission to political actors who have no inclination or tendency to compromise. The professors wish that Ryan, or the university, had fought back. Deborah McDowell, a professor of English, thinks Ryan should have forced the board to fire him.\n\n\n“Capitulation is sometimes in order,” she said. “For this, I don’t think it was. This is spoken as someone who does not agree and would not represent myself as one in full agreement with the decisions Ryan has made throughout his presidency. I am not. But bullies cannot be placated. They are greedy.”\n\n\nThe targeting of UVa may seem somewhat arbitrary, the result of a random commonality in the curricula vitae of two of the nation’s top civil-rights officials. In May, The Chronicle reported a story teasing out the connections between Dhillon; her deputy, Gregory Brown, who attended UVa as an undergraduate and has sued the institution in the past over a civil-rights issue; the Jefferson Council, the conservative alumni group that has been calling on Ryan to resign for months; and the Board of Visitors.\n\n\nLetters from DOJ reveal threats to U.Va. over admissions policies, Ryan’s leadership - The Cavalier Daily - University of Virginia’s Student Newspaper\n\nhttps://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/07/letters-from-doj-reveal-threats-to-uva-over-admissions-policies-ryans-leadership\n\nBetween April 11 and June 17, the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division sent seven letters to University officials, according to documents obtained by The Cavalier Daily through a Freedom of information Act request.\n\n\nIn these letters, the Justice Department sought confirmation that the University had removed affirmative action from its admissions policies and had ended Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives. Some letters also alleged that the University had failed to protect students against antisemitism. The letters did not confirm whether or not the Justice Department’s demands had been met.\n\n\nApril 11: The first letter was sent by the Justice Department to the University April 11 and requested information regarding the University’s admissions policies. The Justice Department said it aimed to ensure the University was no longer using affirmative action, in accordance with the Supreme Court’s decision in Students for Fair Admissions vs. Harvard in 2023.\n\n\nThe letter requested, among other documents, all admissions data broken down by race and ethnicity for the past five academic years, including applicant test scores, GPA, extracurricular activities, essays and admissions outcomes. It also requested that the University verify that race was not used as a factor in determining any scholarship or financial aid awards to students.\n\n\nJune 17: The final letter turned up in the FOIA request was from June 17. “Time is running short, and the Department’s patience is wearing thin,” the letter read.",

(In total, 6 percent of students at U.S. institutions come from other countries.)\n\n\n“The reduction in international students presents a credit risk for universities heavily reliant on this demographic because of potential declines in tuition income, as international students typically pay full tuition fees,” the report states. “Additionally, with declining numbers of high school students over the next several years in the U.S. leading to fewer domestic students, universities intending to fill the gap with more international students may fall short.”\n\n\nNobelist: U.S. Scientists Took Support ‘For Granted’ Before Trump Cuts\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/07/03/nobelist-scientists-took-support-granted-trump\n\nFrances Arnold, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018 for her work on engineering enzymes, told an audience of young scientists in Germany that the “utter chaos” in U.S. politics of recent months, which has seen billions of dollars removed from scientific research, might be viewed in terms of a wider failure to communicate the value of scientific discovery.\n\n\n“Never take for granted that scientific achievement is celebrated—we took it for granted, and for far too long, and we are paying the price,” Arnold told the June 29 opening ceremony of the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting, an annual conference that brings together Nobel laureates and early-career researchers.\n\n\nScientists warn US will lose a generation of talent because of Trump cuts\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/03/national-science-foundation-trump-cuts\n\nThe scientists warn that Trump’s assault on diversity in science is already eroding the quality of fundamental research funded at the NSF, the premier federal investor in basic science and engineering, which threatens to derail advances in tackling existential threats to food, water and biodiversity in the US.\n\n\n“Before Trump, the review process was based on merit and impact. Now, it’s like rolling the dice because a Doge person has the final say,” said one current program officer. “There has never in the history of NSF been anything like this. It’s disgusting what we’re being instructed to do.”\n\n\nTrump’s big, beautiful bill calls for a 56% cut to the current $9bn NSF budget, as well as a 73% reduction in staff and fellowships – with graduate students among the hardest hit.\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve estimates that government-supported research from the NSF and other agencies has had a return on investment of 150% to 300% over the past 75 years, meaning US taxpayers have gotten back between $1.50 and $3 for every dollar invested.\n\n(There is a great graphic titled “Democratic states have had more NSF grants cancelled” and the numbers are 917M in blue states; 583 in red – which is a bit misleading, because TX is the 3rd hardest hit; GA in top part)\n(There is another great graphic on cuts by institution titled “Harvard NSF grants account for 10% of all cancellations, by budget”)\n\nThe sweeping cuts to the NSF come on top of Trump’s dismantling of other key scientific research departments within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Agriculture (USDA) and US Geological Service (USGS).\n\n\nTrump’s big, beautiful bill cuts the USGS budget by 39%. This includes slashing the entire budget for the agency’s ecosystems mission area (EMA), which leads federal research on species & ecosystems and houses the climate adaptation science centers.\n\n\nNIH cuts: Red states losing out as canceled grants are reinstated:\n\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2025/07/03/nih-cuts-grant-restoration-complicated-by-limits-to-court-order-trump-dei-restrictions/\n\nAfter the first grant termination rolled into Professor Cheri Levinson’s inbox, her university told her it wasn’t worth taking the time to appeal the decision; the odds of success were too low. Ultimately, she had three National Institutes of Health grants terminated that were meant to support trainees from diverse backgrounds in her lab studying eating disorders at the University of Louisville.\n\n\nBut her state’s Republican attorney general didn’t join AGs from other states, most of them blue states, who sued the Trump administration to block the grant cancellations. So two weeks ago, when many researchers exhaled in relief as a federal judge ruled that a wide swath of the terminations were illegal, and ordered them reinstated, Levinson wasn’t one of them.\n\n(In blue states 2.1B reinstated; in red states 62M)",

    "text": "“Disaster Looms”: Justice Jackson’s Warning for the Country – Mother Jones\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/06/injunctions-supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson/\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a president who wanted to be king. His Congress was acquiescent. The high court approved. But lower federal courts held firm to the rule of law. Time and again, they blocked the president from seizing power and violating the nation’s laws. So the president turned to the justices on the Supreme Court for a favor: please stop these meddlesome little courts from getting in my way. And then one day in June, the Supreme Court granted his wish.\n\n\nThis is what happened on Friday in a case about birthright citizenship before the United States Supreme Court. The Trump administration’s blatantly unconstitutional executive order from January denying birthright citizenship to the children of certain classes of immigrants quickly ran up against lower court judges, who prohibited the Trump administration from violating one of the country’s most sacred Constitutional rights.\n\n\n“The Court’s decision is nothing less than an open invitation for the Government to bypass the Constitution,” Sotomayor warned. “The Executive Branch can now enforce policies that flout settled law and violate countless individuals’ constitutional rights, and the federal courts will be hamstrung to stop its actions fully.”\n\n\nJackson warns, this decision has altered our system of government and, sooner or later, may destroy it. “Disaster looms,” she warns. If a court cannot command the executive to follow the law, then there exists “a zone of lawlessness within which the Executive has the prerogative to take or leave the law as it wishes, and where individuals who would otherwise be entitled to the law’s protection become subject to the Executive’s whims instead.”\n\n\n“In this country, the Executive does not stand above or outside of the law,” Jackson writes. But her dissent is also a warning that this is becoming less true. A year ago, the Republican appointees exempted the president from the dictates of criminal law. Now, it suggests that even if a court finds the administration’s actions illegal or unconstitutional, it can continue to enforce them against those who haven’t challenged the action in court, either individually or as part of a class action. As a result, the president rises beyond the bounds of the law, and individuals slip from the embrace of its protection.\n\n\n“I have no doubt that, if judges must allow the Executive to act unlawfully in some circumstances, as the Court concludes today, executive lawlessness will flourish, and from there, it is not difficult to predict how this all ends,” Jackson wrote. “Eventually, executive power will become completely uncontainable, and our beloved constitutional Republic will be no more.”",

Every American should be concerned.\n\n\nThe second turning point [first was development of academic freedom] came during World War II, when Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, created the modern partnership between the federal government and the country’s research universities. Bush recognized that by sponsoring research at universities, the United States could lead the world in discoveries and innovations. Over time, American universities became responsible for a large portion of the government’s scientific programs, accepting tens of billions of dollars a year to perform research that would make the country stronger and improve the lives of its citizens.\n\n\nNobody should suppose that this will stop at Columbia or with the specific academic programs targeted by the government’s letter.\n\n\nColumbia nearing agreement to give trump what he wants\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-is-nearing-agreement-to-give-trump-what-he-wants-14315bb3?st=HNVvxe&reflink=article_copyURL_share\n\nDiscussions on the board of trustees are still fluid—with sticking points—and could turn in a different direction before Thursday.\n\n\nAgreement to the demands doesn’t guarantee the federal funds will come back.

Republicans are also escalating their ongoing attacks on wealthy colleges with proposals to significantly increase the tax on university endowments.\n\n\nAnd all of that doesn’t even take into account the possibility that Republicans could revive parts of the College Cost Reduction Act—a comprehensive piece of legislation introduced last Congress to overhaul higher education. Although the bill itself has yet to be introduced, many of its provisions—such as requiring colleges to pay back a portion of students’ unpaid loans—could be part of the forthcoming reconciliation bill, a top priority for Congressional Republicans this spring that could mean billions in cuts to higher education.\n\n\nNorthwestern Journalism Professor Says Pro-Palestinian Activism Cost Him Tenure\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/21/pro-palestinian-journalism-professor-denied-tenure\n\n“Shared Governance Is Crumbling”\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/shared-governance-is-crumbling\n\nAcademic freedom is about the freedom to choose: the freedom to research this problem and not that one, to consider or advance one argument in the classroom and to criticize another. But freedom of choice only means something if the choices themselves are meaningful. Part of how colleges and universities make sure faculty members’ choices have meaning is through shared governance. And shared governance is under attack.\n\n\nAs part of the ongoing legislative attack on academic freedom and campus free speech, state-level proposals to alter university governance and remove faculty from decision-making have bubbled up across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nCUNY Programming cut – a private funder (Thanks MP)\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/newsletter/private-funder-axes-cuny-diversity-initiative/\n\nThe country’s largest private funder of biomedical research has cut its funding for a program at Queens College that had focused on making science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education more inclusive and engaging for students of diverse backgrounds, the college confirmed to THE CITY.\n\n\nThe Inclusive Excellence initiative, launched at the Flushing-based CUNY college in 2022 with funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), ended abruptly last month when the Institute cut short what was supposed to be a $505,000, six-year grant running through 2028.\n\n\nByrd hoped that because the program wasn’t funded by the federal government, but privately, that it would continue on. An HHMI spokesperson declined to provide an explanation for why they pulled the plug.\n\n\n“The Authoritarian Endgame on Higher Education”\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/opinion/trump-research-cuts.html?unlocked_article_code=1.4E4.keqa.qHwBu9NLKbAp&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nAKA, why would one want to kill the golden goose of Higher Ed.\nAlso, CUNY faculty member amongst a trio on “A Really Easy Mark for Trump: Three Columnists on the Threats to Elite Colleges”:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/opinion/trump-research-cuts.html?unlocked_article_code=1.4E4.keqa.qHwBu9NLKbAp&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBetter to fight like men than die like cowards, or something like that\n\n\nAs I wrote above, this is a campaign of destruction. A Russian scholar I know wrote recently that he thought that Trump 2.0 would be like the Chinese Cultural Revolution, but it’s turning out to be more like the Russian Civil War — just utter devastation, the effects of which will be felt for generations.\n\n\nI think that university presidents need to gather together their administrators, faculty members and students — don’t forget the students! — and remind them of these values and call on them to unite to affirm them. This is a very hard thing to do while under attack, to get out of a defensive crouch and try to stand up and lead, but it could point the way forward, and not just for universities.\n\n\nDemands on Columbia to restore funding “Reflect Assault on Higher Ed”\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/03/14/trump-escalates-attack-columbia-his-latest-demands\nThese include: overhaul its discipline process, ban masks, expel some students, put an academic department under review, give its campus security “full law enforcement authority” and reform its admissions practices.\n\nImpact of funding cuts at Columbia\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/03/13/trumps-columbia-cuts-start-hitting-postdocs-professors\n\nImpact on hiring due to uncertainty on federal funding\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/business/cost-cutting/2025/03/14/more-colleges-freeze-hiring-amid-federal-funding-uncertainty\n\nNYU Administration letter to faculty\n\n(select excerpts; thanks KB)\n\nBased on recent federal actions, we’ve identified a number of financial risk areas for the University ranging from federal cuts to research funding to tariffs, as well as a range of other proposals that could affect our overall budget. We don’t yet know whether, when, or to what extent these or other measures may be enacted. In the meantime, we continue to vigorously advocate for robust federal support of higher education. Given the scale of potential outcomes, however, we need to address risks sooner than later.\n\n\nWe are implementing an administrative hiring freeze effective immediately. Th\n\n\nWe anticipate that salary increases for faculty and administrative staff will be lower than they have been in recent years.\n\n\nWe are asking schools and units to prepare contingency plans for more cuts at several levels, so we can respond nimbly should additional budget adjustments be required.\n\n\nWe do not want in any way to minimize the difficulties facing us, but neither will we embrace hopelessness. NYU—and its faculty, students, administrators, and staff—have navigated arduous moments before in our nearly 200-year history while preserving what is important, fulfilling our mission, supporting our community, sustaining our academic trajectory, and being good stewards of the University’s resources. We will do so again now.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Culture War Is No Longer Just a Culture War\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/opinion/trump-khalil-columbia-speech.html\n\nIn other words, universities possess a double obligation — to protect students and faculty and staff members from discrimination and harassment, while also protecting free expression on campus. It’s not an easy task.\n\n\nfederal statutes and regulations permit termination of federal financial assistance only when “compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means” and when “there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply.”\n\n\nColumbia has become Patient Zero in an outbreak of censorship and repression. And unless it’s stopped there, expect more universities to yield to Trump’s control. Expect political repression to spread far beyond the borders of the university.\n\n\n“The End of the University as We Know It”\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/opinion/university-defunding-trump-rufo.html\n\nThe result, if all goes through, will be nothing less than the permanent diminishment of research universities and an upheaval of the free speech principles at the core of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nAppeals Court Overturns Block on Parts of Trump’s DEI Orders\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/17/appeals-court-overturns-block-parts-trumps-dei-orders\n\nAhead of the Fourth Circuit’s ruling, the plaintiffs who sued the Trump administration over the orders, including the American Association of University Professors and the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, told the district judge that officials weren’t complying with the injunction.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Education Department Investigates Dozens of Colleges for Discrimination”\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/race-ethnicity/2025/03/15/education-department-accuses-51-colleges-discrimination\nPerhaps due to support of the PhD Project\n\nStates sue to block DOE layoffs\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/14/states-file-lawsuit-challenging-education-department-cuts\n\nIs Title VI the New Title IX?\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/is-title-vi-the-new-title-ix\nMentions complaints about pace of investigation process at Baruch\n(CUNY had voluntary agreements for both titles.)\n\nIs this the end of the Department of Education?\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/03/19/trump-signs-order-break-education-department\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed the long-awaited executive order Thursday directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to close down her department “to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.”\n\n\nThe order won’t result in the immediate closure of the 45-year-old agency; only Congress can get rid of the department.\n\n\n\n\nTrump is setting the US on a path to educational authoritarianism (thanks EI)\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/17/trump-us-path-educational-authoritarianism\n\nThe most straightforward way to read the letter and the guidelines is as defining “school-on-student harassment” as including Black history. The letter treats teaching large swaths of Black and Indigenous history as akin to a white professor consistently referring to all of their Black students with a terrible racial slur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgetown University graduate student detained by immigration authorities\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/georgetown-university-graduate-student-detained-immigration-authoritie-rcna197206\n\nMasked agents arrested the student, Badar Khan Suri, outside his home in Arlington, Virginia, on Monday night, attorney Hassan Ahmad said.\n\n\nHere’s a resource that specifically lists those actions that impact colleges and universities work with international students, scholars, and faculty. (Thanks SF)\n\nhttps://www.nafsa.org/executive-and-regulatory-actions-trump2admin\n\n\n\n\nWhy might higher education be under\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/opinion/andreessen-musk-trump-silicon-valley.html?unlocked_article_code=1.404.W7Cu.Mm09erVCtF7P&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThomas Edsall quotes Marc Andreessen\n\nno way to fix American higher education without replacement, and there is no way to replace them without letting them fail. And in a sense, this is the most obvious conclusion of all time. What happens in the business world when a company does a bad job? It fails and another company takes its place. That’s how you get progress. Below this is the process of evolution.\n\nHe goes on to quote Gil Duran on “tech oligarchs”\n\nare an existential threat to democracy. Look at the news. It makes no sense that a presidential administration would seek to crash the economy while allowing an unelected foreign-born billionaire to rip apart the government. This goes against every rule in politics. Trump’s poll numbers are sinking yet he’s taking no steps to correct the course. This is the logic of a suicide bomber.\n\n\nEducation is a right (By Maya Wiley)\n\nhttps://msmagazine.com/2025/03/19/education-cuts-trump-project-2025-public-schools/\n\nThe Trump administration’s war on public education is a war on our kids.\n\n\nTrump’s backing comes from a minority of radical ideologues who want a very different America—one that is significantly less diverse, less rich in rights, more indoctrinated to their extremist version of Christianity, steeped in a history of white-ethno-Christian nationalism. The authors want an unraveling of a system that has been partially, though not completely, transformed by the civil rights movement. The end game is clear: Charter schools, religious schools and private schools will benefit from a much greater share of public education dollars with less accountability.

In a letter last week, the Trump administration said meeting its nine requests was a “precondition for formal negotiations.”\n\n\nPlan to strip U Penn of 175M in funding\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-to-pause-175-million-for-university-of-pennsylvania-over-transgender-policy.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAcademic Freedom Index: ‘serious concern’ for US universities (Paywall; Thanks BE)\n\nhttps://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/academic-freedom-index-serious-concern-us-universities\n\nCongress Eyes More Control Over Colleges\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/03/21/congress-eying-more-control-over-colleges\n\nthey’ve introduced bills to crack down on immigration and foreign influence by threatening student visas and restricting international donations; to hamper flexibility for borrowers by capping student loan amounts; and to suppress “liberal ideologies,” by establishing penalties for pro-Palestinian protests. Republicans are also escalating their ongoing attacks on wealthy colleges with proposals to significantly increase the tax on university endowments.\n\n\nAnd all of that doesn’t even take into account the possibility that Republicans could revive parts of the College Cost Reduction Act—a comprehensive piece of legislation introduced last Congress to overhaul higher education. Although the bill itself has yet to be introduced, many of its provisions—such as requiring colleges to pay back a portion of students’ unpaid loans—could be part of the forthcoming reconciliation bill, a top priority for Congressional Republicans this spring that could mean billions in cuts to higher education.\n\n\nNorthwestern Journalism Professor Says Pro-Palestinian Activism Cost Him Tenure\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/21/pro-palestinian-journalism-professor-denied-tenure\n\n“Shared Governance Is Crumbling”\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/shared-governance-is-crumbling\n\nAcademic freedom is about the freedom to choose: the freedom to research this problem and not that one, to consider or advance one argument in the classroom and to criticize another. But freedom of choice only means something if the choices themselves are meaningful. Part of how colleges and universities make sure faculty members’ choices have meaning is through shared governance. And shared governance is under attack.\n\n\nAs part of the ongoing legislative attack on academic freedom and campus free speech, state-level proposals to alter university governance and remove faculty from decision-making have bubbled up across the country.",

An HHMI spokesperson declined to provide an explanation for why they pulled the plug.\n\n\n“The Authoritarian Endgame on Higher Education”\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/opinion/trump-research-cuts.html?unlocked_article_code=1.4E4.keqa.qHwBu9NLKbAp&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nAKA, why would one want to kill the golden goose of Higher Ed.\nAlso, CUNY faculty member amongst a trio on “A Really Easy Mark for Trump: Three Columnists on the Threats to Elite Colleges”:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/opinion/trump-research-cuts.html?unlocked_article_code=1.4E4.keqa.qHwBu9NLKbAp&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBetter to fight like men than die like cowards, or something like that\n\n\nAs I wrote above, this is a campaign of destruction. A Russian scholar I know wrote recently that he thought that Trump 2.0 would be like the Chinese Cultural Revolution, but it’s turning out to be more like the Russian Civil War — just utter devastation, the effects of which will be felt for generations.\n\n\nI think that university presidents need to gather together their administrators, faculty members and students — don’t forget the students! — and remind them of these values and call on them to unite to affirm them. This is a very hard thing to do while under attack, to get out of a defensive crouch and try to stand up and lead, but it could point the way forward, and not just for universities.\n\n\nDemands on Columbia to restore funding “Reflect Assault on Higher Ed”\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/03/14/trump-escalates-attack-columbia-his-latest-demands\nThese include: overhaul its discipline process, ban masks, expel some students, put an academic department under review, give its campus security “full law enforcement authority” and reform its admissions practices.\n\nImpact of funding cuts at Columbia\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/03/13/trumps-columbia-cuts-start-hitting-postdocs-professors\n\nImpact on hiring due to uncertainty on federal funding\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/business/cost-cutting/2025/03/14/more-colleges-freeze-hiring-amid-federal-funding-uncertainty\n\nNYU Administration letter to faculty\n\n(select excerpts; thanks KB)\n\nBased on recent federal actions, we’ve identified a number of financial risk areas for the University ranging from federal cuts to research funding to tariffs, as well as a range of other proposals that could affect our overall budget. We don’t yet know whether, when, or to what extent these or other measures may be enacted. In the meantime, we continue to vigorously advocate for robust federal support of higher education. Given the scale of potential outcomes, however, we need to address risks sooner than later.\n\n\nWe are implementing an administrative hiring freeze effective immediately. Th\n\n\nWe anticipate that salary increases for faculty and administrative staff will be lower than they have been in recent years.\n\n\nWe are asking schools and units to prepare contingency plans for more cuts at several levels, so we can respond nimbly should additional budget adjustments be required.\n\n\nWe do not want in any way to minimize the difficulties facing us, but neither will we embrace hopelessness. NYU—and its faculty, students, administrators, and staff—have navigated arduous moments before in our nearly 200-year history while preserving what is important, fulfilling our mission, supporting our community, sustaining our academic trajectory, and being good stewards of the University’s resources. We will do so again now.",
