The city’s outbreak has been linked to cooling towers, which use water and a fan to cool buildings.\n\n\nHealth officials disclosed Thursday that 12 cooling towers within Harlem buildings tested positive for the bacteria. Those affected include Harlem Hospital, a city health clinic, a popular retail center on 125th Street, a CUNY college science building and the Harlem condo center on Lenox Avenue.\n\n\nTest results\n\nhttps://www.ccny.cuny.edu/presidentsoffice/blog/notice-legionella-negative-test-results-marshak-building-cooling-tower\n\nWe are pleased to inform that the test results were negative for legionella bacteria. This confirms that the cooling tower system is in compliance with The New York CITY Department of Health and mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) requirements and poses no health risk to building occupants or the community.\n\n\n\n\n\nFight Cuts, Defend Higher Education at the University of Oregon\n\nhttps://actionnetwork.org/petitions/fight-cuts-defend-higher-education-at-the-university-of-oregon\n(Thanks JC)\n\n… The anticipated layoffs also appear to have a disproportionate impact on the Humanities, which are key to a liberal arts education that teaches critical thinking, effective self-expression, and a multiplicity of perspectives. …\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinion | They’re Killing the Humanities On Purpose\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/theyre-killing-the-humanities-on-purpose\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Playing at Being a Wartime President\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/opinion/trump-intrusion-lincoln-roosevelt.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Much here in T. Edsall’s piece applies to higher education)\n\nCulturally, Trump is seeking to redefine the boundaries of public discourse: pressuring universities, elevating grievance politics and reshaping federal agencies to reflect ideological loyalty rather than expertise or experience.\n\n\nFor Sean Wilentz, a historian at Princeton, the word “intrusive” fails to capture the full scope of Trump’s agenda. Writing by email, Wilentz argued that Trump “has intimidated major institutions of civil society, including universities, major law firms, and the corporate media, to bend them to his will. He has deployed the military for political purposes. He has militarized ICE and turned it into nation’s largest law enforcement force, accountable only to himself and Stephen Miller, thus laying the basis for a police state. …”\n\n\nFor Trump, the rule of law is not a principle of democratic government; it is a speed bump on the road to exercising unilateral authority. In his own mind, he is on a path to the ultimate in gold-plated power.\n\n\n\n\n\nTex. Boards Abolish Faculty Senates, Create Toothless Councils\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/08/22/tex-boards-abolish-faculty-senates-create\n\nThe University of Texas System Board of Regents voted Thursday to disband the system’s long-standing faculty senates in compliance with Senate Bill 37, the sweeping Texas higher education law that gives university boards and presidents control over faculty governing bodies.\n\n\nThe UT board also voted Thursday to create faculty advisory groups, which will “perform the work of faculty governance bodies”—such as reviewing degree requirements, suggesting curricular changes, coordinating campus events and revising the faculty handbook—while keeping all decision-making power in the hands of the administration.\n\n\nBut the groups won’t give the faculty independent representation or any real power. In accordance with SB 37, the board bylaws now state, “a faculty council is advisory only and may not be delegated the final decision-making authority on any matter.”\n\n\nEven as university governing boards design their toothless, SB 37–compliant groups, two professors at the University of Houston on Monday unveiled what they’re calling the Faux Faculty Senate. “I know that people feel that faculty senates are kind of arcane … but it’s a part of civil society,” said David Mazella, an associate professor in the English Department at the University of Houston and president-elect of the faux senate. “[SB 37] is an antidemocratic bill that essentially eliminates the faculty voice in order for the state to directly control what we do.”\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Higher Ed Alone Cannot Save Democracy’ – interview with AAUP leader\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/labor-unionization/2025/08/19/aaup-president-higher-ed-alone-cannot-save#\n(Thanks JC)\n\nQ: We’re now more than six months into Trump’s second administration. What is the current state of academic freedom?\n\n\nA: It’s being washed over by an administration that has no respect, or even probably understanding, of the concept. We’re seeing massive infringement of academic freedom at the individual level. But then, it’s also the academic freedom of institutions.\n\n\nI never expected the Trump administration to take a democracy, or the health of American society, to heart, because they’re grifters and they’re in it for their own personal power and their own personal wealth. But I did not expect that they would be so outlandishly intent on destroying a sector that’s so important to the fundamental values and power of American society.\n\n\nVance and Trump and [Christopher] Rufo and Stephen Miller and the ilk that run our government are fascist in a 21st-century variant—not operating within the constructs of our society, [but] trying to rip those constructs down.\n\n\n[Secondly,] we sued the Trump administration on our own six times. With our AFT [American Federation of Teachers] as our [union] affiliate … probably another three or four times.\n\n\nThey’re doing so many things that are so obviously unconstitutional and illegal, and so we’re trying to use the courts to slow them down.\n\n\nThe third [tactic]—and you’ll see more of this, but you’ve probably been watching and seen it throughout the spring of last year—is getting our people into the streets, fighting back, offering a different vision. This has primarily happened in response to the NIH, NSF cuts.\n\n\nThe fourth area is that we need to offer … a countervision of higher education to the Trump vision, which is higher education ideologically controlled by the federal government, in its most extreme form, as well as the complete destruction of our biomedical research infrastructure and our research over all.\n\n\nWe’re working on a policy vision that will move us into the midterms … a counterimaginary of higher ed to the imaginary that’s been developed by the Trump administration, by Chris Rufo, one where we’re all Marxist ideologues indoctrinating our students.\n\n\nThe last area is that we’re supporting the development of organizing at the campus level to challenge and hold our administrations accountable, whether supporting the mutual aid defense compact projects that [have] mushroomed across higher ed, or supporting the fights at campus levels around academic freedom and freedom of speech, or any other number of things that we’re doing to support faculty at the campus level, to get their administrations to hold firm and not to bow to the Trump administration’s demands before they even make them.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: A Critic of Universities Is Rallying to Defend Them in the Trump Era\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/arts/fire-freedom-expression-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, an increasingly prominent free-speech organization, has long been known as a fierce opponent of campus political correctness. Since its founding in 1999, it has been celebrated for defending conservatives and other dissidents from the prevailing liberal culture at America’s universities.\n\n\nSo when the group announced a lawsuit this month challenging the Trump administration’s efforts to deport noncitizen students who expressed pro-Palestinian views, some admirers were dismayed.\n\n\n\n\nFederal District Judge Rules Against Trump’s Anti-DEI Orders\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/18/federal-district-judge-rules-against-trumps-anti-dei-orders\n\nIn her opinion, Gallagher focused less on the legality of the attempt to ban DEI itself, but rather the process through which the president and secretary of education tried to do so.\n\n\n“This court takes no view as to whether the policies at issue in this case are good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair. But, at this stage too, it must closely scrutinize whether the government went about creating and implementing them in the manner the law requires. Here, it did not,” the judge wrote. “By leapfrogging important procedural requirements, the government has unwittingly run headfirst into serious constitutional problems.”\n\n\nThat said, she did explain the ways Trump’s policy violated the Constitution, saying, “The government cannot proclaim that it ‘will no longer tolerate’ speech it dislikes because of its ‘motivating ideology’—that is a ‘blatant’ and ‘egregious’ violation of the First Amendment.”\n\n\nSince the Education Department’s anti-DEI guidance was enjoined, the Trump administration has made other attempts to block the same academic practices. Most recently, the Department of Justice published a nine-page memo that stated that DEI is unlawful and discriminatory.\n\n(See)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/2025/07/30/doj-declares-slew-dei-practices-unlawful-memo\n\nColleges Rushed to Comply With Trump’s Anti-DEI Guidance. A Judge Just Struck It Down. Now What?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/colleges-rushed-to-comply-with-trumps-anti-dei-guidance-a-judge-just-struck-it-down-now-what\n\nU.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, a Trump appointee, ruled on Thursday that the U.S. Education Department acted unlawfully when it issued two guidance documents telling institutions to dismantle DEI programs or risk losing federal funding.\n\n\nNYTimes: In Trump’s Ideal Picture of America, Diversity Is Taboo\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/21/us/politics/trump-diversity-black-americans.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nOver the past seven months, Mr. Trump’s words and actions have revealed what he sees as an ideal picture of the United States, in which the concept of diversity is taboo; the traditional power centers in America — white and wealthy men — get the benefit of the doubt; immigrants are suspect or unwelcome; and people of color must set their grievances and outrage aside.\n\n\nIn the view of his critics, Mr. Trump has used the power of the federal government to promote a vision of America that not only challenges the legitimacy of the Black experience, but also demeans and dehumanizes people of color. In the process, they say, he has elevated and even endorsed a version of American culture that venerates a white-dominated society of old, and casts the history and reality of race in the United States as unwelcome or suspiciously “woke.”\n\n\nIn the first months of his second term, Mr. Trump has abandoned core tenets of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Pentagon has ordered military leaders to review all books in their libraries that address racism and sexism. The administration announced this week that it would begin screening immigrants seeking to live or work in the United States for “anti-American ideologies.” Mr. Trump has banned almost every refugee from entering the country, with the exception of white South African farmers who federal officials have said would better assimilate into the United States.\n\n\nFederal agencies have obscured published references to the contributions of Black heroes, from the Tuskegee Airmen who fought in the military, to Harriet Tubman, who guided enslaved people along the Underground Railroad. He has accused the Smithsonian Institution of incorporating “divisive, race-centered ideology” in its exhibits on race.\n\n\nSeveral of Mr. Trump’s appointees have amplified extremist views, including on official social media accounts. The Department of Homeland Security in June shared a poster that called for reporting “foreign invaders,” an image that was originally shared by a podcaster who hosts a Christian nationalist show and calls himself a supporter of the “Old American Right.” The host has said the concept affirms “the domination and pre-eminence of the European-derived peoples, their institutions and their way of life.”\n\n\nMizzou Calls Black 2 Class Event Example of “Discrimination”\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/diversity/2025/08/21/mizzou-calls-black-2-class-event-discrimination\n\nMizzou President Mun Choi added in a statement that “when holding events using university facilities, student organizations must avoid excluding individuals based on race.”\n\n\nThis follows a similar dispute last year, when the university changed the name of a similar LBC event from the Welcome Black BBQ to the Welcome Black and Gold BBQ, a nod to the university’s colors. This year, LBC declined to participate, letting university officials know in July.\n\n\n“Let’s be clear,” the student group [LBC] wrote. “These actions are a deliberate act of erasure … Recreational spaces for students of all identities are CRUCIAL.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany U.S. Colleges May Close Without Immigrants And International Students, Report Finds\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2025/08/14/many-colleges-may-close-without-immigrants-and-international-students/\n\n“Without immigrants, international students and the children of immigrants, the undergraduate student population in America would be almost 5 million students smaller in 2037 than 2022, or about two-thirds of its current size, while the graduate student population would be at least 1.1 million students smaller, or only about 60% of its current size,” according to the NFAP study.\n\n\nAmerica’s population shifts portend hardship for U.S. colleges and universities and the communities surrounding them. That means their future may rest on whether U.S. policymakers adopt welcoming immigration policies or Trump officials follow through on an anti-immigration agenda. The Trump administration has adopted what educators see as aggressive measures against international students, including compelling Columbia University to reduce its “dependence” on international students. The administration has also set a goal of deporting one million or more immigrants.\n\n\nTrump administration has revoked 6,000 student visas, official says - The Washington Post\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/08/19/student-visas-revoked-6000-trump/\n\nA department spokesperson said in an email that it has revoked more than 6,000 student visas, of which about 4,000 were for crimes including assault, driving under the influence and burglary.\n\n\nBetween 200 and 300 student visas were revoked because of “support for terrorism,” the official said, without elaborating. Trump administration officials have accused students of supporting terrorism by participating in pro-Palestinian activism in several high-profile cases this year.\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the students whose visas were revoked because of alleged law violations had been convicted of any crimes.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Tactics Mean Many International Students Won’t Make It to Campus\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/20/us/trump-visa-vetting-international-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBetween the federal government’s heightened vetting of student visas and President Trump’s travel ban, the number of international students newly enrolled in American universities seems certain to drop — by a lot.\n\n\nThere were about a million international students studying in the United States a year ago, according to figures published by the State Department. Data on international student enrollment is not expected to be released until the fall. But higher education is already feeling the pain and deeply worried about the fallout.\n\n\nIn China and India, there have been few visa appointments available for students in recent months, and sometimes none at all, according to the Association of International Educators, also known as NAFSA, a professional organization. If visa problems persist, new international student enrollment in American colleges could drop by 30 to 40 percent overall this fall, a loss of 150,000 students, according to the group’s analysis.\n\n\nMore Barriers on the Horizon for International Students\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/08/20/more-barriers-horizon-international-students\n\nThe Trump administration is planning to limit how long international students can remain in the U.S., likely mirroring a plan proposed at the end of Trump’s first term with the same name, advocacy groups and immigration attorneys say.\n\n\nThe regulations are expected to replace “duration of status,” a 1991 rule that allows international students to remain in the country as long as they are enrolled at a college or university. In 2020, the administration proposed limiting that time to just four years—a period shorter than most Ph.D. programs and shorter than the average student takes to complete a bachelor’s degree—though it would have allowed students to apply for extensions. Students from certain countries, including those the administration said were state sponsors of terrorism and those with high overstay rates, would have been afforded just two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump budget officials claim sweeping spending power from Congress, records show\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/08/19/trump-budget-congress-impoundment/\n\nThe Trump administration is asserting authority to withhold billions of dollars from low-income housing services, education assistance, medical research grants and other programs approved by Congress, according to public documents released Monday.\n\n\nThe new practices — which increase the leverage and power of budget chief Russell Vought — are likely to reignite a clash over the administration’s power to freeze dollars approved by Congress, usurping authority that the legislative branch has under the Constitution. The power struggle dates to President Donald Trump’s first term, when his refusal to release congressionally approved money for Ukraine helped spark a House impeachment, from which he was acquitted in the Senate.\n\n\nThe agency’s newly released documents, made public under the court order, show Trump’s budget office is imposing litmus tests on releasing money — demanding plans from agencies to show they are following guidance Trump has laid out in executive actions, such as avoiding spending on diversity programs. While Trump has authority to issue those directives, experts say they do not, under law, carry the same weight as congressional actions.\n\n\nWe deny the government’s motion\n\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26070574-ucresearcherstayca9082125/\n\nthe district court [for the Northern District of California] issued a class-wide preliminaryinjunction ordering three government agencies to reinstate research grants theagencies had terminated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. The governmentappealed and moved for a partial stay pending appeal of the preliminaryinjunction.\n\n\n\n\nNIH Director Orders Review of All Current, Planned Research\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/19/nih-director-orders-review-all-current-planned-research\n\nThe National Institutes of Health’s director ordered employees to “conduct an individualized review of all current and planned research activities,” including active grants and funding opportunity announcements, according to images of a document provided to Inside Higher Ed. The review comes amid concerns that the NIH won’t distribute all of its allocated grant money by the time the federal fiscal year ends Sept. 30, meaning those dollars will return to the U.S. Treasury.\n\n\nThe document images, provided by a source who wished to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation, show that NIH director Jay Bhattacharya sent the memo Friday and that the review is effective immediately. According to the memo, “relevant NIH personnel” must review grants, funding opportunity announcements, contracts, contract solicitations, applications for new and competing renewal awards, intramural research and research training programs, cooperative agreements, and “other transactions.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Updates: Supreme Court Rules N.I.H. Grants for Disfavored Research Can Be Cut\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/08/21/us/trump-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nSCOTUS Says NIH Doesn’t Have to Restore Canceled Grants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/08/21/scotus-says-nih-doesnt-have-restore-canceled\n\nThe United States Supreme Court is allowing the National Institutes of Health to cut nearly $800 million in grants, though it left the door open for the researchers to seek relief elsewhere.\n\n(Can’t blame this one on Roberts)\n\n“The reason is straightforward,” Kavanaugh wrote. “The core of plaintiffs’ suit alleges that the government unlawfully terminated their grants. That is a breach of contract claim. And under the Tucker Act, such claims must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims, not federal district court.”\n\n(also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Trump, the Education Dept. has flipped its civil rights mission\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/08/18/trump-education-department-civil-rights/\n\nThe Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights is so short-staffed that some attorneys have as many as 300 cases, making it impossible to devote attention to most of them, current and former employees said. Fewer cases are being closed, and 90 percent of those resolved were dismissed, typically without an investigation, up from 80 percent last year, according to data obtained by The Washington Post.\n\n\nAt the same time, under Trump, the civil rights office has announced investigations of at least 99 schools, often based on news coverage or complaints from conservative groups. As of early August, the administration had launched 27 directed investigations, probes that are opened without an outside complaint, court filings show.\n\n\nNow, the office has opened several investigations into whether programs aimed at addressing inequities amount to illegal discrimination in favor of those students. Forty-five colleges, for instance, are being investigated for working with the PhD Project, a program that has tried to boost the number of Black, Hispanic and Native American students who earn doctorates in business.\n\n\nAbout half of the civil rights office’s employees were laid off in March as part of a deep cut to the Education Department’s staff. Seven of 12 regional offices were closed including the Cleveland office. The remaining five offices also lost personnel due in part to incentive programs that paid people to resign or retire early.\n\n\n“We have been left with thousands of cases that need to be reassigned and need to be handled by a small group of people,” said one attorney, whose caseload increased fivefold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Wants Universities to Show Him the Money, or No Deal\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/us/politics/trump-universities-financial-penalties.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Again we see this reporting from the same trio of writers)\n\nThe emerging agreement with Harvard would see the school spend $500 million, owing to Mr. Trump’s demand that the university spend more than double what Columbia agreed to pay.\n\n(But we also see some other framing)\n\nCritics have likened Mr. Trump’s methods to extortion.\n\n\nowing to Mr. Trump’s demand that the university spend more than double what Columbia agreed to pay.\n\n\nHow Mr. Trump arrives at his figures for financial penalties is not entirely clear, but he has suggested that challenging his administration as Harvard did raises the stakes. He noted in May that Columbia had taken itself off “the hot seat” by negotiating with the government without availing itself to legal remedies. Harvard sued the administration, leading to many weeks of acrimony before talks restarted.\n\n\n“Every time they fight, they lose another $250 million,” Mr. Trump said of Harvard in the spring.\n\n\n“Harvard has to understand, the last thing I want to do is hurt them,” he added. “They’re hurting themselves. They’re fighting.”\n\n(How to spin this as anything systematic and just is impossible it seems)\n\nThe White House has not publicly explained the formula for the U.C.L.A. demand.\n\n\nBut officials from several universities have privately described feeling as if they had little choice but to take Mr. Trump’s demands seriously, no matter how exorbitant they seem, given the government’s leverage in funding medical, national security and other research that schools perform.\n\n\nMr. Trump appears to have a limited interest in the finer details of the financial settlements. He has not insisted, for instance, that universities write checks to the Treasury Department — Brown University will spend $50 million on state work force development programs — and there is no evidence that Mr. Trump has sought to direct money to pursuits like his presidential library. But government officials have made clear there is little room to haggle over the price tags.\n\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom and other state officials were even sharper in their response, condemning the demand as “a billion-dollar political shakedown from the pay-to-play president” and “disgusting political extortion.” Mr. Newsom indicated he would sue.\n\n\n\n\n\nUChicago Lost Money on Crypto, Then Froze Research When Federal Funding Was Cut\n\nhttps://stanfordreview.org/uchicago-lost-money-on-crypto-then-froze-research-when-federal-funding-was-cut/\n\nOn January 28, hours after the Trump administration announced the first round of grant cancellations (which was later scaled back before being renewed last week), UChicago administrators sent out an alarming directive to researchers at the school:\n\n\n“We are requesting that all University researchers working on federal grants temporarily suspend their non-personnel spending on [sic] federal grants as much as possible during this period of substantial uncertainty. For example, do not make any additional spending commitments, purchase new supplies or equipment, start new experiments, embark on funded travel, etc.”\n\n\nUChicago has since walked back their directive, sending a clarifying email that researchers could resume normal spending, unless they’d received a specific directive otherwise. However, behind the scenes, the situation remains dire: Labs have received orders to downsize, faculty are being paid out to retire early, and fear and uncertainty pervade the academic community.\n\n\nUChicago’s financial position is clear: Unlike near-peer institutions, its endowment is not large enough to sustain its spending and debt. The university carries nearly $6 billion in debt while running annual budget deficits exceeding $200 million, all on an endowment three times smaller than Stanford’s. To compensate, the university has focused on expanding lucrative certification programs, increasing donations, raising tuitions, and cutting costs, though many faculty and students viscerally disagree with the administration on which costs to cut.\n\n\nPossibly the most notorious example is the university’s foray into cryptocurrency. Four sources, as well as widespread campus rumors, allege that the university lost tens of millions investing in crypto around 2021. Given UChicago’s extraordinary 37.6% endowment gain that year, far beyond what conventional investments would have yielded, it’s likely they took significant risks. But if those gambles paid off in the short term, they quickly unraveled. … UChicago’s endowment remains lower today than in 2021.\n\n(See from last week “UChicago Reducing, Freezing Ph.D. Admissions for Multiple Humanities Programs”)\n(Also )\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/newsletter/the-review/2025-08-18\n\nMore UChicago Ph.D. Programs Will Pause Admissions\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/graduate/2025/08/21/more-uchicago-phd-programs-will-pause-admissions\n\nThe University of Chicago’s Arts and Humanities Division is now pausing new Ph.D. student admissions for the 2026–27 academic year across all departments except philosophy and one program within the music department. The move expands on last week’s announcement from the dean that about half of all departments would pause admissions, while the rest would reduce the number of admissions.\n\n\nThe departments that won’t be accepting Ph.D. students now include art history, cinema and media studies, classics, comparative literature, East Asian languages and civilizations, English language and literature, Germanic studies, linguistics, Middle Eastern studies, Romance languages and literatures, Slavic languages and literatures, and South Asian languages and civilizations, plus the music department’s ethnomusicology and history and theory of music programs.\n\n\nThe Social Sciences Division has also announced it will not admit Ph.D. students into four programs in 2026-27: anthropology, political economy, social thought, and conceptual and historical studies of science. The UChicago Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy and Practice had earlier announced it was pausing Ph.D. admissions and the Harris School of Public Policy said it was pausing admissions for the Harris Ph.D. (in public policy studies), the political economy Ph.D. and the master of arts in public policy with certificate in research methods.\n\n\n\n\n\nDOE investigates Haverford\n\nhttps://www.inquirer.com/education/us-education-department-investigation-haverford-college-20250820.html\n(Thanks JC.

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is planning to more than halve its financial aid budget for out-of-state students. From coast to coast, graduate schools are admitting fewer applicants.\n\n\nThe financial squeeze comes just as demographic trends point toward plunging enrollments in the coming years that could force further belt-tightening.\n\n\nAlthough months may pass before some of the most drastic shifts take effect, students and administrators alike are facing uncertainty over how much a school could potentially change over the course of a semester, much less an entire degree program.\n\n\nSome of the turmoil traces directly to the Trump administration, which has been seeking to punish a clutch of elite schools. It is also, more broadly, trying to transform the financial ties between Washington and the nation’s colleges.\n\n\nA ‘Great Defection’ threatens to empty universities and colleges of top teaching talent\n\nhttps://hechingerreport.org/a-great-defection-threatens-to-empty-universities-and-colleges-of-top-teaching-talent/\n(Thanks JC!)\n\nWith higher education under political assault, and opportunities as well as job security diminished by enrollment declines, Cossette felt burnt out and disillusioned. So she quit her hard-won job as an assistant professor of American government at a small private college in Maryland and used the skills she’d learned to go into business for herself as a freelance copy editor.\n\n\nNow Cossette is hearing from other newly minted Ph.D.s and tenured faculty who want out — so many, she’s expanded her business to help them leave academia, as she did.\n\n\nAn exodus appears to be under way of Ph.D.s and faculty generally, who are leaving academia in the face of political, financial and enrollment crises. It’s a trend federal data and other sources show began even before Trump returned to the White House.\n\n\nAs for faculty, more than a third of provosts reported higher-than-usual turnover last year, in a survey by Hanover Research and the industry publication Inside Higher Ed. That was before the turmoil of this late winter and spring.\n\n\n“People who can get out will get out,” said L. Maren Wood, director and CEO of the Center for Graduate Career Success,\n\n\n“You’re basically knee-capping that younger generation, which undermines the intergenerational dynamism that takes place in higher education. And that trickles down into the classroom,” said Isaac Kamola, an associate professor of political science at Trinity College and head of the Center for the Defense of Academic Freedom at the American Association of University Professors, or AAUP.\n\n\n\n\n\nRise of the Incompetents (opinion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/08/22/rise-incompetents-opinion\n\nIn one of the articles I found myself scrolling, John Villasenor, writing for the Brookings Institution, suggested that LLMs would lead to “the democratization of good writing.” I was surprised to see that description. The ChatGPT-produced assignments I see on a weekly basis are rarely mistakable for “good.”\n\n(The USS also believes AI will democratize learning)\n\nMore to the point, research suggests that uniform style and content will not produce a level playing field of competent writers but, more likely, a ceiling of barely capable thinkers. In a study published by Nature Human Behaviour, researchers discovered that “reliance on ChatGPT … reduces the diversity of ideas in a pool of ideas,” to the degree that “94 percent of ideas from those who used ChatGPT ‘shared overlapping concepts.’”\n\n\nOf course, the choices don’t end there. I also decided how to approach the topic; what references to pull; how to order my paragraphs (both before and after I wrote them); what idioms, metaphors and introductory language to use; where to place hooks and callbacks; what to title the piece; and how to utilize grammar and punctuation to express my sassy indignation. These are vital skills for students to practice, not because they’re required in every profession, but because they emphasize executive function and cognitive reasoning. Writers are responsible for what they write, speakers for what they say, leaders for what they decide and voters for whom they elect. This in and of itself is reason enough to teach actual writing.\n\n\nBoth thematically and practically, this partnership, forged in campaign contributions, public appearances and the elimination of internal dissent (see: Jeff Bezos and The Washington Post), represents a threat to the university system. The Trump White House, intent on canceling research grants, deporting students and revoking accreditation, has very clearly demonstrated its opposition to “the elites” of academia. Ignorant consumers, like ignorant voters, are easier to manipulate, and ignorance thrives when education falters.\n\n\nThe falseness of LLM-generated content is a perfect fit for the reality-rejecting ethos of the Trump administration. Back in April, the White House was accused of outsourcing its world-altering tariff calculations to ChatGPT. In May, the Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., published a report that experts discovered was filled with what appeared to be AI-generated false citations.\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls. The shortened wapo links are gift articles; the Chronicle links should be available through a CUNY library–but there are still procurement issues!

Writing by email, Wilentz argued that Trump “has intimidated major institutions of civil society, including universities, major law firms, and the corporate media, to bend them to his will. He has deployed the military for political purposes. He has militarized ICE and turned it into nation’s largest law enforcement force, accountable only to himself and Stephen Miller, thus laying the basis for a police state. …”\n\n\nFor Trump, the rule of law is not a principle of democratic government; it is a speed bump on the road to exercising unilateral authority.

What is the current state of academic freedom?\n\n\nA: It’s being washed over by an administration that has no respect, or even probably understanding, of the concept. We’re seeing massive infringement of academic freedom at the individual level. But then, it’s also the academic freedom of institutions.\n\n\nI never expected the Trump administration to take a democracy, or the health of American society, to heart, because they’re grifters and they’re in it for their own personal power and their own personal wealth. But I did not expect that they would be so outlandishly intent on destroying a sector that’s so important to the fundamental values and power of American society.\n\n\nVance and Trump and [Christopher] Rufo and Stephen Miller and the ilk that run our government are fascist in a 21st-century variant—not operating within the constructs of our society, [but] trying to rip those constructs down.\n\n\n[Secondly,] we sued the Trump administration on our own six times. With our AFT [American Federation of Teachers] as our [union] affiliate … probably another three or four times.\n\n\nThey’re doing so many things that are so obviously unconstitutional and illegal, and so we’re trying to use the courts to slow them down.\n\n\nThe third [tactic]—and you’ll see more of this, but you’ve probably been watching and seen it throughout the spring of last year—is getting our people into the streets, fighting back, offering a different vision. This has primarily happened in response to the NIH, NSF cuts.\n\n\nThe fourth area is that we need to offer … a countervision of higher education to the Trump vision, which is higher education ideologically controlled by the federal government, in its most extreme form, as well as the complete destruction of our biomedical research infrastructure and our research over all.\n\n\nWe’re working on a policy vision that will move us into the midterms … a counterimaginary of higher ed to the imaginary that’s been developed by the Trump administration, by Chris Rufo, one where we’re all Marxist ideologues indoctrinating our students.\n\n\nThe last area is that we’re supporting the development of organizing at the campus level to challenge and hold our administrations accountable, whether supporting the mutual aid defense compact projects that [have] mushroomed across higher ed, or supporting the fights at campus levels around academic freedom and freedom of speech, or any other number of things that we’re doing to support faculty at the campus level, to get their administrations to hold firm and not to bow to the Trump administration’s demands before they even make them.",

Since its founding in 1999, it has been celebrated for defending conservatives and other dissidents from the prevailing liberal culture at America’s universities.\n\n\nSo when the group announced a lawsuit this month challenging the Trump administration’s efforts to deport noncitizen students who expressed pro-Palestinian views, some admirers were dismayed.\n\n\n\n\nFederal District Judge Rules Against Trump’s Anti-DEI Orders\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/18/federal-district-judge-rules-against-trumps-anti-dei-orders\n\nIn her opinion, Gallagher focused less on the legality of the attempt to ban DEI itself, but rather the process through which the president and secretary of education tried to do so.\n\n\n“This court takes no view as to whether the policies at issue in this case are good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair. But, at this stage too, it must closely scrutinize whether the government went about creating and implementing them in the manner the law requires. Here, it did not,” the judge wrote. “By leapfrogging important procedural requirements, the government has unwittingly run headfirst into serious constitutional problems.”\n\n\nThat said, she did explain the ways Trump’s policy violated the Constitution, saying, “The government cannot proclaim that it ‘will no longer tolerate’ speech it dislikes because of its ‘motivating ideology’—that is a ‘blatant’ and ‘egregious’ violation of the First Amendment.”\n\n\nSince the Education Department’s anti-DEI guidance was enjoined, the Trump administration has made other attempts to block the same academic practices. Most recently, the Department of Justice published a nine-page memo that stated that DEI is unlawful and discriminatory.\n\n(See)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/2025/07/30/doj-declares-slew-dei-practices-unlawful-memo\n\nColleges Rushed to Comply With Trump’s Anti-DEI Guidance.

In the process, they say, he has elevated and even endorsed a version of American culture that venerates a white-dominated society of old, and casts the history and reality of race in the United States as unwelcome or suspiciously “woke.”\n\n\nIn the first months of his second term, Mr. Trump has abandoned core tenets of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Pentagon has ordered military leaders to review all books in their libraries that address racism and sexism. The administration announced this week that it would begin screening immigrants seeking to live or work in the United States for “anti-American ideologies.” Mr. Trump has banned almost every refugee from entering the country, with the exception of white South African farmers who federal officials have said would better assimilate into the United States.\n\n\nFederal agencies have obscured published references to the contributions of Black heroes, from the Tuskegee Airmen who fought in the military, to Harriet Tubman, who guided enslaved people along the Underground Railroad. He has accused the Smithsonian Institution of incorporating “divisive, race-centered ideology” in its exhibits on race.\n\n\nSeveral of Mr. Trump’s appointees have amplified extremist views, including on official social media accounts. The Department of Homeland Security in June shared a poster that called for reporting “foreign invaders,” an image that was originally shared by a podcaster who hosts a Christian nationalist show and calls himself a supporter of the “Old American Right.” The host has said the concept affirms “the domination and pre-eminence of the European-derived peoples, their institutions and their way of life.”\n\n\nMizzou Calls Black 2 Class Event Example of “Discrimination”\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/diversity/2025/08/21/mizzou-calls-black-2-class-event-discrimination\n\nMizzou President Mun Choi added in a statement that “when holding events using university facilities, student organizations must avoid excluding individuals based on race.”\n\n\nThis follows a similar dispute last year, when the university changed the name of a similar LBC event from the Welcome Black BBQ to the Welcome Black and Gold BBQ, a nod to the university’s colors. This year, LBC declined to participate, letting university officials know in July.\n\n\n“Let’s be clear,” the student group [LBC] wrote. “These actions are a deliberate act of erasure … Recreational spaces for students of all identities are CRUCIAL.”",

That means their future may rest on whether U.S. policymakers adopt welcoming immigration policies or Trump officials follow through on an anti-immigration agenda. The Trump administration has adopted what educators see as aggressive measures against international students, including compelling Columbia University to reduce its “dependence” on international students. The administration has also set a goal of deporting one million or more immigrants.\n\n\nTrump administration has revoked 6,000 student visas, official says - The Washington Post\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/08/19/student-visas-revoked-6000-trump/\n\nA department spokesperson said in an email that it has revoked more than 6,000 student visas, of which about 4,000 were for crimes including assault, driving under the influence and burglary.\n\n\nBetween 200 and 300 student visas were revoked because of “support for terrorism,” the official said, without elaborating. Trump administration officials have accused students of supporting terrorism by participating in pro-Palestinian activism in several high-profile cases this year.\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the students whose visas were revoked because of alleged law violations had been convicted of any crimes.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Tactics Mean Many International Students Won’t Make It to Campus\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/20/us/trump-visa-vetting-international-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBetween the federal government’s heightened vetting of student visas and President Trump’s travel ban, the number of international students newly enrolled in American universities seems certain to drop — by a lot.\n\n\nThere were about a million international students studying in the United States a year ago, according to figures published by the State Department. Data on international student enrollment is not expected to be released until the fall. But higher education is already feeling the pain and deeply worried about the fallout.\n\n\nIn China and India, there have been few visa appointments available for students in recent months, and sometimes none at all, according to the Association of International Educators, also known as NAFSA, a professional organization. If visa problems persist, new international student enrollment in American colleges could drop by 30 to 40 percent overall this fall, a loss of 150,000 students, according to the group’s analysis.\n\n\nMore Barriers on the Horizon for International Students\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/08/20/more-barriers-horizon-international-students\n\nThe Trump administration is planning to limit how long international students can remain in the U.S., likely mirroring a plan proposed at the end of Trump’s first term with the same name, advocacy groups and immigration attorneys say.\n\n\nThe regulations are expected to replace “duration of status,” a 1991 rule that allows international students to remain in the country as long as they are enrolled at a college or university. In 2020, the administration proposed limiting that time to just four years—a period shorter than most Ph.D. programs and shorter than the average student takes to complete a bachelor’s degree—though it would have allowed students to apply for extensions. Students from certain countries, including those the administration said were state sponsors of terrorism and those with high overstay rates, would have been afforded just two years.",

The power struggle dates to President Donald Trump’s first term, when his refusal to release congressionally approved money for Ukraine helped spark a House impeachment, from which he was acquitted in the Senate.\n\n\nThe agency’s newly released documents, made public under the court order, show Trump’s budget office is imposing litmus tests on releasing money — demanding plans from agencies to show they are following guidance Trump has laid out in executive actions, such as avoiding spending on diversity programs. While Trump has authority to issue those directives, experts say they do not, under law, carry the same weight as congressional actions.\n\n\nWe deny the government’s motion\n\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26070574-ucresearcherstayca9082125/\n\nthe district court [for the Northern District of California] issued a class-wide preliminaryinjunction ordering three government agencies to reinstate research grants theagencies had terminated pursuant to certain Executive Orders.

The review comes amid concerns that the NIH won’t distribute all of its allocated grant money by the time the federal fiscal year ends Sept. 30, meaning those dollars will return to the U.S. Treasury.\n\n\nThe document images, provided by a source who wished to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation, show that NIH director Jay Bhattacharya sent the memo Friday and that the review is effective immediately. According to the memo, “relevant NIH personnel” must review grants, funding opportunity announcements, contracts, contract solicitations, applications for new and competing renewal awards, intramural research and research training programs, cooperative agreements, and “other transactions.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Updates: Supreme Court Rules N.I.H.

Fewer cases are being closed, and 90 percent of those resolved were dismissed, typically without an investigation, up from 80 percent last year, according to data obtained by The Washington Post.\n\n\nAt the same time, under Trump, the civil rights office has announced investigations of at least 99 schools, often based on news coverage or complaints from conservative groups. As of early August, the administration had launched 27 directed investigations, probes that are opened without an outside complaint, court filings show.\n\n\nNow, the office has opened several investigations into whether programs aimed at addressing inequities amount to illegal discrimination in favor of those students. Forty-five colleges, for instance, are being investigated for working with the PhD Project, a program that has tried to boost the number of Black, Hispanic and Native American students who earn doctorates in business.\n\n\nAbout half of the civil rights office’s employees were laid off in March as part of a deep cut to the Education Department’s staff. Seven of 12 regional offices were closed including the Cleveland office. The remaining five offices also lost personnel due in part to incentive programs that paid people to resign or retire early.\n\n\n“We have been left with thousands of cases that need to be reassigned and need to be handled by a small group of people,” said one attorney, whose caseload increased fivefold.",

He noted in May that Columbia had taken itself off “the hot seat” by negotiating with the government without availing itself to legal remedies. Harvard sued the administration, leading to many weeks of acrimony before talks restarted.\n\n\n“Every time they fight, they lose another $250 million,” Mr. Trump said of Harvard in the spring.\n\n\n“Harvard has to understand, the last thing I want to do is hurt them,” he added. “They’re hurting themselves. They’re fighting.”\n\n(How to spin this as anything systematic and just is impossible it seems)\n\nThe White House has not publicly explained the formula for the U.C.L.A. demand.\n\n\nBut officials from several universities have privately described feeling as if they had little choice but to take Mr. Trump’s demands seriously, no matter how exorbitant they seem, given the government’s leverage in funding medical, national security and other research that schools perform.\n\n\nMr. Trump appears to have a limited interest in the finer details of the financial settlements. He has not insisted, for instance, that universities write checks to the Treasury Department — Brown University will spend $50 million on state work force development programs — and there is no evidence that Mr. Trump has sought to direct money to pursuits like his presidential library. But government officials have made clear there is little room to haggle over the price tags.\n\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom and other state officials were even sharper in their response, condemning the demand as “a billion-dollar political shakedown from the pay-to-play president” and “disgusting political extortion.” Mr. Newsom indicated he would sue.\n\n\n\n\n\nUChicago Lost Money on Crypto, Then Froze Research When Federal Funding Was Cut\n\nhttps://stanfordreview.org/uchicago-lost-money-on-crypto-then-froze-research-when-federal-funding-was-cut/\n\nOn January 28, hours after the Trump administration announced the first round of grant cancellations (which was later scaled back before being renewed last week), UChicago administrators sent out an alarming directive to researchers at the school:\n\n\n“We are requesting that all University researchers working on federal grants temporarily suspend their non-personnel spending on [sic] federal grants as much as possible during this period of substantial uncertainty. For example, do not make any additional spending commitments, purchase new supplies or equipment, start new experiments, embark on funded travel, etc.”\n\n\nUChicago has since walked back their directive, sending a clarifying email that researchers could resume normal spending, unless they’d received a specific directive otherwise. However, behind the scenes, the situation remains dire: Labs have received orders to downsize, faculty are being paid out to retire early, and fear and uncertainty pervade the academic community.\n\n\nUChicago’s financial position is clear: Unlike near-peer institutions, its endowment is not large enough to sustain its spending and debt. The university carries nearly $6 billion in debt while running annual budget deficits exceeding $200 million, all on an endowment three times smaller than Stanford’s. To compensate, the university has focused on expanding lucrative certification programs, increasing donations, raising tuitions, and cutting costs, though many faculty and students viscerally disagree with the administration on which costs to cut.\n\n\nPossibly the most notorious example is the university’s foray into cryptocurrency. Four sources, as well as widespread campus rumors, allege that the university lost tens of millions investing in crypto around 2021. Given UChicago’s extraordinary 37.6% endowment gain that year, far beyond what conventional investments would have yielded, it’s likely they took significant risks. But if those gambles paid off in the short term, they quickly unraveled. … UChicago’s endowment remains lower today than in 2021.\n\n(See from last week “UChicago Reducing, Freezing Ph.D. Admissions for Multiple Humanities Programs”)\n(Also )\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/newsletter/the-review/2025-08-18\n\nMore UChicago Ph.D. Programs Will Pause Admissions\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/graduate/2025/08/21/more-uchicago-phd-programs-will-pause-admissions\n\nThe University of Chicago’s Arts and Humanities Division is now pausing new Ph.D. student admissions for the 2026–27 academic year across all departments except philosophy and one program within the music department. The move expands on last week’s announcement from the dean that about half of all departments would pause admissions, while the rest would reduce the number of admissions.\n\n\nThe departments that won’t be accepting Ph.D. students now include art history, cinema and media studies, classics, comparative literature, East Asian languages and civilizations, English language and literature, Germanic studies, linguistics, Middle Eastern studies, Romance languages and literatures, Slavic languages and literatures, and South Asian languages and civilizations, plus the music department’s ethnomusicology and history and theory of music programs.\n\n\nThe Social Sciences Division has also announced it will not admit Ph.D. students into four programs in 2026-27: anthropology, political economy, social thought, and conceptual and historical studies of science. The UChicago Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy and Practice had earlier announced it was pausing Ph.D. admissions and the Harris School of Public Policy said it was pausing admissions for the Harris Ph.D. (in public policy studies), the political economy Ph.D. and the master of arts in public policy with certificate in research methods.\n\n\n\n\n\nDOE investigates Haverford\n\nhttps://www.inquirer.com/education/us-education-department-investigation-haverford-college-20250820.html\n(Thanks JC.

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is planning to more than halve its financial aid budget for out-of-state students. From coast to coast, graduate schools are admitting fewer applicants.\n\n\nThe financial squeeze comes just as demographic trends point toward plunging enrollments in the coming years that could force further belt-tightening.\n\n\nAlthough months may pass before some of the most drastic shifts take effect, students and administrators alike are facing uncertainty over how much a school could potentially change over the course of a semester, much less an entire degree program.\n\n\nSome of the turmoil traces directly to the Trump administration, which has been seeking to punish a clutch of elite schools. It is also, more broadly, trying to transform the financial ties between Washington and the nation’s colleges.\n\n\nA ‘Great Defection’ threatens to empty universities and colleges of top teaching talent\n\nhttps://hechingerreport.org/a-great-defection-threatens-to-empty-universities-and-colleges-of-top-teaching-talent/\n(Thanks JC!)\n\nWith higher education under political assault, and opportunities as well as job security diminished by enrollment declines, Cossette felt burnt out and disillusioned. So she quit her hard-won job as an assistant professor of American government at a small private college in Maryland and used the skills she’d learned to go into business for herself as a freelance copy editor.\n\n\nNow Cossette is hearing from other newly minted Ph.D.s and tenured faculty who want out — so many, she’s expanded her business to help them leave academia, as she did.\n\n\nAn exodus appears to be under way of Ph.D.s and faculty generally, who are leaving academia in the face of political, financial and enrollment crises. It’s a trend federal data and other sources show began even before Trump returned to the White House.\n\n\nAs for faculty, more than a third of provosts reported higher-than-usual turnover last year, in a survey by Hanover Research and the industry publication Inside Higher Ed. That was before the turmoil of this late winter and spring.\n\n\n“People who can get out will get out,” said L. Maren Wood, director and CEO of the Center for Graduate Career Success,\n\n\n“You’re basically knee-capping that younger generation, which undermines the intergenerational dynamism that takes place in higher education.

    "text": "Rise of the Incompetents (opinion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/08/22/rise-incompetents-opinion\n\nIn one of the articles I found myself scrolling, John Villasenor, writing for the Brookings Institution, suggested that LLMs would lead to “the democratization of good writing.” I was surprised to see that description. The ChatGPT-produced assignments I see on a weekly basis are rarely mistakable for “good.”\n\n(The USS also believes AI will democratize learning)\n\nMore to the point, research suggests that uniform style and content will not produce a level playing field of competent writers but, more likely, a ceiling of barely capable thinkers. In a study published by Nature Human Behaviour, researchers discovered that “reliance on ChatGPT … reduces the diversity of ideas in a pool of ideas,” to the degree that “94 percent of ideas from those who used ChatGPT ‘shared overlapping concepts.’”\n\n\nOf course, the choices don’t end there. I also decided how to approach the topic; what references to pull; how to order my paragraphs (both before and after I wrote them); what idioms, metaphors and introductory language to use; where to place hooks and callbacks; what to title the piece; and how to utilize grammar and punctuation to express my sassy indignation. These are vital skills for students to practice, not because they’re required in every profession, but because they emphasize executive function and cognitive reasoning. Writers are responsible for what they write, speakers for what they say, leaders for what they decide and voters for whom they elect. This in and of itself is reason enough to teach actual writing.\n\n\nBoth thematically and practically, this partnership, forged in campaign contributions, public appearances and the elimination of internal dissent (see: Jeff Bezos and The Washington Post), represents a threat to the university system. The Trump White House, intent on canceling research grants, deporting students and revoking accreditation, has very clearly demonstrated its opposition to “the elites” of academia. Ignorant consumers, like ignorant voters, are easier to manipulate, and ignorance thrives when education falters.\n\n\nThe falseness of LLM-generated content is a perfect fit for the reality-rejecting ethos of the Trump administration. Back in April, the White House was accused of outsourcing its world-altering tariff calculations to ChatGPT. In May, the Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., published a report that experts discovered was filled with what appeared to be AI-generated false citations.\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls. The shortened wapo links are gift articles; the Chronicle links should be available through a CUNY library–but there are still procurement issues!

She pushed for disciplining law professor Ramzi Kassem on the grounds that he represented Mahmoud Khalil, and Saly Abd Alla, the university’s chief diversity officer, over her past work as a civil rights director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Minnesota.\n\n\n“Does it concern you that New York taxpayers are paying for the legal defense fund of Mahmoud Khalil?” she asked Matos Rodríguez.\n\n\nMatos Rodríguez said he was not familiar with those individual employees, but stressed that any employee who violates CUNY’s rules will be investigated. He said CUNY had no complaints related to Abd Alla and that she is not directly involved with handling cases related to students and faculty.\n\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters repeatedly interrupted the hearing. As Matos Rodríguez spoke, one person yelled, “Israel is burning children alive.” Later in the hearing, another protester also shouted to disrupt Matos Rodríguez’s remarks, prompting Rep. Randy Fine (R-Fla.) to say, “Shut up and get out of here… get out of here you loser.”\n\n\nRep. Alma Adams (D-N.C.) relayed to the chancellor CUNY faculty members’ concerns about professors who were not reappointed despite having fully enrolled classes scheduled for the fall. “As a former professor myself and a department chair — somebody who believes deeply in transparency and fairness — I want to ask you: would you be willing to follow up with my office and provide more information on the policies and procedures that guide faculty appointments and reappointments at CUNY?” she asked. Matos Rodríguez said he was willing to cooperate fully with the committee.\n\n\n“These hearings are political theater. That’s all they are,” said David Cole, a Georgetown Law professor who testified in his capacity as an expert on the First Amendment at an earlier hearing in May. “It almost doesn’t matter what the university presidents say… there is no effort to even determine what the truth is, what actually happened, or whether any legal lines have been crossed.”\n\n\nCUNY’s Repression of Pro-Palestine Students Continues in Front of Congress\n\nhttps://www.thenation.com/article/politics/cuny-house-republicans-hearing-repression/\n\nThe Professional Staff Congress—CUNY’s staff and faculty union—and many from the greater CUNY community are saying the hearing by House Republicans was really meant to silence CUNY’s advocates for Palestinian human rights. Matos-Rodriguez, they argue, failed to defend those community members, as well as the tenets of free speech and robust, open conversation that are critical components of a thriving academic institution. “It was an egregious abdication of his responsibility as an academic and his responsibility as a leader of an academic institution,” said Heba Gowayed, an associate professor of sociology at Hunter College.\n\n\nStefanik’s latest battle doesn’t fight antisemitism; it attacks due process\n\nhttps://thehill.com/opinion/education/5409278-elise-stefanik-targets-cuny-clear/\n\nStefanik’s latest target has been a legal clinic at the City University of New York School of Law, called CUNY CLEAR, an acronym for Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility.\n\n\nWhatever the merits of Stefanik’s other accusations, she is absolutely wrong about CUNY CLEAR. Representation of a controversial client is in the best tradition of legal education.\n\n\nOutraged that CUNY CLEAR had played a key role in Khalil’s representation, Stefanik called upon Rodriguez to fire the CUNY professor who coordinated the defense.\n\n\nRodriguez was non-committal, promising only to investigate the situation. That was the tactful response, but he missed a teachable moment.\n\n\nAlthough that may never be acceptable to Stefanik, Rodriguez should have explained that representing unpopular clients is what lawyers are supposed to do, and what law students should be taught to do.\n\n\nI [Steven Lubet, opinion contributor] agree with almost nothing Khalil stands for, but I believe strongly in due process and fair trials. There is no right to appointed counsel in immigration cases, so Khalil’s representation could only come from organizations such as the ACLU and CLEAR.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYS AAUP sends letter to BC President\n\n\nDear President Anderson,\n\n\nWe are writing to express concern about the recent firing and non-renewals of four Brooklyn College adjunct faculty members, recently addressed in statements by the Professional Staff Congress-CUNY and CUNY University Faculty Senate leadership.\n\n\nWhile the Brooklyn College administration and the CUNY Board of Trustees have the power of review and final decision, faculty have primacy in academic decision-making, including matters of faculty status. This principle is clearly established in the 1940 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities, jointly formulated by the American Association of University Professors, the American Council on Education (ACE), and the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges (AGB).\n\n\nAccording to the 1940 Statement faculty have primary responsibility in decisions related to: “appointments, reappointments, decisions not to reappoint, promotions, the granting of tenure, and dismissal….The governing board and president should, on questions of faculty status, as in other matters where the faculty has primary responsibility, concur with the faculty judgment except in rare instances and for compelling reasons which should be stated in\n\n\nWe appreciate this is an ongoing personnel matter and wish to respect the privacy of the faculty members involved. However, it appears that neither these individuals nor the departments that recommended their renewal for the coming academic year have been informed of the reasons for their dismissal or non-renewal. Without stated reasons, faculty cannot effectively respond to the administration, as required by AAUP standards of shared governance.\n\n\nIf the Brooklyn College administration has not already done so, we encourage you to clearly communicate the reasons for the non-renewals and firing for cause to the individual faculty members and their departments as well as to allow them the opportunity to respond following Brooklyn College governance procedures.\n\nThis letter references one sent by the UFS XC and co-chairs of the UFS AF committee:\n\nDear President Anderson,\n\n\nThe University Faculty Senate Executive Committee has been notified of potential academic freedom issues on your campus. It has been reported to us that four adjunct faculty were not reappointed after receiving recommendations from their respective departments and chairpersons. We would hope that the reports of non-reappointment are due to extracurricular political expressions are not the case.\n\n\nWhile the UFS does not represent any faculty in contract compliance manners, we do defend academic freedom vigorously. In particular, we take the lead of the AAUP which in 2018 reaffirmed “That there should be no invidious distinction between those who teach and/or conduct research in higher education, regardless of whether they hold full-time or part-time appointments or whether their appointments are tenured, tenure-track, or contingent. All faculty members should have access to the same due-process protections and procedures.”\n\n\nFurther, we follow the AAUP statement on governance where it states, “The governing board and president should, on questions of faculty status, as in other matters where the faculty have primary responsibility, concur with the faculty judgment except in rare instances and for compelling reasons which should be stated in detail.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Hundreds of NASA Employees, Past and Present, Sign Letter of Formal Dissent\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/science/nasa-formal-dissent-letter-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nA public letter from NASA employees on Monday urges leaders of the space agency not to carry out deep cuts sought by the Trump administration.\n\nhttps://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/06e6b87deb245d66/67ef9b90-full.pdf\n\n“We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety, scientific advancement and efficient use of public resources,” the employees wrote in the letter. It is addressed to Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, whom President Trump appointed this month as acting NASA administrator.\n\n\nThe NASA letter follows similar letters of criticism by federal employees at the National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency. Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the N.I.H. director, said he welcomed respectful dissent, but the E.P.A. placed 144 employees who signed that agency’s letter on leave.\n\n\n\n\n\nScience and Democracy Under Siege | Union of Concerned Scientists\n\nhttps://www.ucs.org/resources/science-and-democracy-under-siege\n\nThe first six months of President Trump’s second term have been characterized by destruction of democratic processes, divisive and vindictive actions, and chaos in federal government agencies.\n\n\nSince the Inauguration, the administration has systematically destroyed federal scientific systems. The Trump administration’s actions are not normal. This is an illegal power grab—a wholesale attack on the democratic systems upon which this nation was built.\n\n\nBetween January 20 and June 30 of this year, we documented 402 attacks on science.\n\n(Executive summary)\nhttps://www.ucs.org/sites/default/files/2025-07/6-Months-Trump-summary.pdf\n(The report has charts on Extreme Rise in Documented Attacks on Science; Staff Cuts in Science Agencies; Steep Decline in New Research Grants Awarded by the National Institutes of Health; Industrial Facilities Eligible for Air Pollution Regulation Exemptions; Disruptions and Terminations of Federal Advisory Committees at Science Agencies; Removal of Government Webpages and Information Related to Climate Change and Environmental Justice; Major Trump Administration Attacks on Climate and Clean Energy Policies and Investments. Off to read the whole thing)\n\n\n\n\nThe Dangers of the Manhattan Statement\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/columns/debatable-ideas/2025/07/22/dangers-manhattan-statement\n\nSomething that caught my eye last week was news of a statement calling for even more government control over higher education from a group of conservatives. This comes as the right fully embraces Donald Trump’s authoritarian commands against universities. Developed by Christopher Rufo of the Manhattan Institute, the Manhattan Statement was carefully designed using public polling to create vague, popular-sounding principles (“truth” “freedom of speech” “equality” “civil discourse” “transparency”) that obscure its plan for massive federal control over colleges and repression of dissent.\n\n\nThe Manhattan Statement is a recipe for tyranny. Even if some people might agree with its goals, what’s important are not the ends but the repressive means used to achieve them. It calls for “a new contract with the universities, which should be written into every grant, payment, loan, eligibility, and accreditation, and punishable by revocation of all public benefit.” We’ve already seen how the Trump regime has terribly, illicitly abused its power over government contracts to punish colleges without due process. The Manhattan Statement would vastly expand this power to include all federal funding and student loans, making every college held hostage for its existence to any demands of the government.\n\n\nInstead of pretending that “antisemitism” somehow justified cutting off federal funds in direct defiance of the due process required under Title VI, the Manhattan Statement would provide a wide array of reasons for political ideologues to destroy a college, with its amorphous calls to abolish “ideology” and “activism” and require “swift expulsion” of anyone deemed to violate “civil discourse.”\n\n\nIn recent years, many conservatives have abandoned their past commitments to free speech and the rejection of federal control over academia. … It’s disturbing to see so many thoughtful conservatives that I respect joining a call for massive expansion of government control over colleges.\n\n\nOne of the signers, Representative Virginia Foxx (R-NC), is a member (and former chair) of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, a sign that the Manhattan Statement is not some theoretical wish list aimed at reforming universities, but a very real political threat that could easily be enforced on colleges in the near future.\n\n\nHowever, even terrible legislation is too slow a process for these conservatives, who write that “we call on the President of the United States to draft a new contract with the universities” with these extraordinary requirements.\n\n\nTo legitimize government intrusion, the Manhattan Statement invents pure historical fiction\n\n(Well, I’d quote the whole thing, but I’ll stop here)\n\nWhat the Manhattan Statement claims to be the problem—“a new kind of tyranny—one in which ideology determines truth, and the university functions as a political agent …”—is, in fact, the perfect description of Rufo’s solution. He’s simply taking a deluded fantasy of left-wing tyranny on campus as a justification to impose a very real proposal for right-wing tyranny.\n\n\nNYTimes: I Watched It Happen in Hungary. Now It’s Happening Here.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/opinion/hungary-viktor-orban.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAfter years watching Hungary suffocate under the weight of its democratic collapse, I came to understand that the real danger of a strongman isn’t his tactics; it’s how others, especially those with power, justify their acquiescence.\n\n\nHungarians with little power or privilege to lose would occasionally protest. But those with power remained reliably, pliably silent.\n\n\nThe American officials and academics who, like me, lived in Hungary during this period would often tell ourselves stories to explain this submissiveness: that docility is rooted in Hungary’s oppressive Communist past, that its democracy was simply too young to withstand a strongman.\n\n\nThen I returned to the United States, and what I’ve witnessed over these past months at home has exposed those stories as wishful thinking.\n\n\nHere, too, powerful people are responding to authoritarian advances just as their Hungarian counterparts have — not with defiance, but with capitulation, convinced that they can maintain their independence and stay above the fray.\n\n\nThe lesson of Hungary is this: We cannot claim to care about democracy only when it costs nothing. President Trump, like Mr. Orban, no doubt believes that everyone can be bought. America’s elites are proving him right. There is a Hungarian phrase I heard often: “Van az a penz” — “There’s always a price.”\n\n\n\n\n\nReport: Faculty Often Missing From University Decisions on AI\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/07/22/faculty-often-missing-university-decisions-ai\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nThe findings come more than a year after a group of practitioners and researchers wrote the AI Bill of Rights for Educators, which included a call for faculty agency in making choices about “whether, when, and how to use AI based on learning goals, student populations/learning contexts and pedagogical judgment.” But the AAUP’s survey suggests that most colleges and universities aren’t upholding that tenet of AI governance.\n\nhttps://engageai.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/125/2025/04/An-AI-Bill-of-Rights-for-Educators-Revision-2025.03.28-2.pdf\n\n“Many colleges and universities currently have no meaningful shared governance mechanisms around technology,” read the AAUP’s report. “[T]he explosion of AI has highlighted the need for such mechanisms among faculty members at individual institutions and across the higher education workforce.”\n\n\n“People are terrified of the onslaught of uncritical AI narratives and partnerships across many sectors, and what it means for the future,” Britt Paris, co-author of the report and associate professor of library and information science at Rutgers University, said in an email to Inside Higher Ed. “But in talking with higher education workers across the country, we on the committee have seen that AI in higher education is barely even functional and tech companies view higher education as a cash cow to exploit.”\n\n\nTo avoid some of those potential downsides, the report recommended that universities gather input from faculty, staff and students before making deals with tech companies—and write liability clauses into the contracts they do procure. It also called for institutions to give faculty members, staff and students the right to opt-out of technology use without negatively affecting their working or learning conditions, as well as allowing faculty to challenge the implementation of certain ed tech products if the benefit isn’t clear.\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege Employees in Kansas Can’t List Pronouns in Emails\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/sex-gender/2025/07/24/kansas-colleges-say-employees-cant-list-pronouns-emails\n\nKansas public university leaders have ordered employees to remove “gender-identifying pronouns or gender ideology” from their email signatures. The officials say they’re complying with new state prohibitions against diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n\nSB 125 also specifically requires the secretary to certify that agencies have “removed gender identifying pronouns or gender ideology from email signature blocks on state employee’s [sic] email accounts and any other form of communication.” The law doesn’t define DEI or gender ideology.\n\n\nRoss Marchand, program counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, told Inside Higher Ed the new Kansas law is unconstitutional.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the University of Kansas’s chancellor, provost and chief health sciences officer wrote to KU’s campuses that “all employees shall comply with this directive by removing gender-identifying pronouns and personal pronoun series from their KU email signature blocks, webpages and Zoom/Teams screen IDs, and any other form of university communications.”\n\n\nThe leaders also warned against efforts to circumvent the ban. “Your KU email account is your only official means for sending emails related to your employment at the university,” they wrote. “Do not use an alternate third-party service, such as Gmail, to conduct university business or communications.”\n\n\n\n\nThe Manhattan Statement on Higher Education\n\nhttps://manhattan.institute/article/the-manhattan-statement-on-higher-education\n(If others didn’t take them seriously, there would be no reason to read this. A sampling of their “facts” follows)\n\nThe universities have capitulated to the radical Left’s “long march through the institutions,” which has converted them into laboratories of ideology, rather than institutions oriented toward truth.\n\n\nThe universities have built enormous “diversity, equity, and inclusion” bureaucracies that discriminate on the basis of race and violate the fundamental principle of equality—that high prize which was inscribed in the Declaration of Independence and codified into law with the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act.\n\n\nThe universities have contributed to a new kind of tyranny, with publicly funded initiatives designed to advance the cause of digital censorship, public health lockdowns, child sex-trait modification, race-based redistribution, and other infringements on America’s long-standing rights and liberties.\n\n\nThe universities have corrupted faculty hiring practices with racial quotas, ideological filters, and diversity statements, which function as loyalty oaths to the Left and have virtually eliminated conservative scholars from the prestige institutions.\n\n\nThe universities have degraded the liberal arts with reductive ideologies that no longer aim to preserve and discover what is highest in man, but to unleash resentments against Western civilization, from the Greeks and Romans, to the English and the Americans.\n\n(The chaser)\n\nTo that end, we call on the President of the United States to draft a new contract with the universities, which should be written into every grant, payment, loan, eligibility, and accreditation, and punishable by revocation of all public benefit:\n\n(These include)\n\nThe universities must uphold the highest standard of civil discourse, with swift and significant penalties, including suspension and expulsion, for anyone who would disrupt speakers, vandalize property, occupy buildings, call for violence, or interrupt the operations of the university.\n\n\nThe universities must provide transparency about their operations and, at the end of each year, publish complete data on race, admissions, and class rank; employment and financial returns by major; and campus attitudes on ideology, free speech, and civil discourse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis new $250 visa fee applies to international student visas too.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/visa-integrity-fee-what-to-know-about-new-travel-fee-to-enter-the-us-.html\n(Thanks JC)\n\nThe fee will be at least $250 during the U.S. fiscal year 2025, which runs from Oct. 1, 2024, to Sept. 30, 2025.

Academics testified that they had rewritten syllabi, withdrawn op-eds, and canceled research trips out of fear that they, too, could face retribution for expressing political opinions.\n\n\n“The goal is to chill speech, to silence students and scholars who wish to express pro-Palestinian views,” Alexandra Conlon, a lawyer for the academic groups, said during closing arguments. “It is stifling dissent.”\n\n\nBut Ethan B. Kanter, another lawyer representing the Trump administration, countered that noncitizens’ speech rights are “context dependent.” As an example, he pointed to federal campaign-finance law, which prohibits donations from foreign nationals. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that campaign spending is protected speech under the First Amendment. The campaign restrictions underscore that “not in every instance” do noncitizens have “equivalent rights,” Kanter said.\n\n\nArmstrong was questioned in particular about Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University graduate student whose visa revocation he directly approved. He said an op-ed critical of Israel that she co-authored was “not a key factor” in his decision. Yet the article was the only specific support he provided as evidence of her “activity and association” with Students for Justice in Palestine…Armstrong also testified that he did not recall being given “any concrete guidance” about what constitutes antisemitism, and he said did not know of formal training given to other State Department officials who reviewed protesters’ cases.\n\n\nArmstrong was part of at least 20 conversations with officials in the White House, Department of Homeland Security, and other agencies, including with Stephen Miller, deputy White House chief of staff and the president’s top adviser on immigration.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Student Arrests, and the Lawsuit Fighting Them, Tread New Ground\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/us/politics/trump-student-arrests-immigration-trial.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe four veteran immigration agents who recently took the stand in federal court had at least two things in common. All were career law enforcement officials. And none could remember ever being asked to make arrests like the ones they carried out earlier this year.\n\n\nThe men said they acted on orders handed down from Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s office in March to detain several noncitizen students, including a doctoral student from Tufts University whose arrest was captured on video and garnered significant attention. Mr. Rubio had abruptly revoked their legal status, which cleared them for detention by immigration agents, citing a rarely used law.\n\n\nNYTimes: State Dept. Opens Investigation Into Harvard’s Use of International Visas\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/us/politics/state-department-trump-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\nInside the powerful task force spearheading Trump’s assault on colleges, DEI\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/18/antisemitism-task-force-dei-universities-trump/\n\nThe administration established the task force in February to counter what it describes as widespread failure by universities to protect Jewish students since the start of campus protests against the Israel-Gaza war. In reality, many of the task force’s unprecedented demands and punishments have nothing to do with antisemitism. Instead, they seek hiring and programming changes to strip long-standing conservative targets including DEI and a liberal worldview from higher education.\n\n\n“It’s self-evident it’s not about antisemitism,” said Yehuda Kurtzer, president of the Shalom Hartman Institute, a Jerusalem-based research and educational center focused on world Jewish life and pluralism. “Why would that have anything to do with cutting funding for research? It’s about conservative fears of higher education, and antisemitism is an excuse.”\n\n\nThe work — which at times has ignored legal norms and procedures — is driven by the task force, made up of senior officials in the Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services departments, as well as the little-known General Services Administration. Since almost the start of Trump’s second term, they have invoked both antisemitism and DEI in a quest to transform the culture of campuses and stamp out what many Republicans see as outright hostility to conservative values, discourse and thought.\n\n\nOne task force member said it makes sense to create a “global settlement” with universities that would encompass a range of alleged violations. Task force investigations sometimes start out examining allegations of antisemitism, this person said, but then identify what members see as other concerns, such as race-conscious admissions, which the Supreme Court has ruled are unconstitutional.\n\n\nTo push colleges to comply, the administration has frozen billions of dollars in federal funding to at least six highly selective universities — notably Harvard and Columbia, which have seen the highest-profile federal cuts — but also Cornell, Northwestern, Brown and Princeton.\n\n\nOne targeted school, Brown University, said its funding was cut without “any formal notification or explanation” from the federal government and “in spite of Brown’s cooperation with multiple government reviews and our compliance with the law.”\n\n\nThe public face is Leo Terrell … Terrell posts on social media throughout the day, echoing some of the right’s most incendiary and baseless claims. He also rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, often simply posting “I hate DEI” and tagging people of color with whom he disagrees as DEI hires. … He’s also echoed antisemitic comments…Multiple people said Terrell has little experience in the type of legal work the task force is undertaking and is not involved in its day-to-day legal strategy.\n\n\nMuch of the task force’s work is being shepherded by lower-profile senior administration officials: Tom Wheeler and Sean Keveney, the acting general counsels of the departments of Education and Health and Human Services, and Gruenbaum from the General Services…Harmeet Dhillon directly oversees the group’s work…Dhillon and her political team scour social media to identify instances of antisemitism and determine what investigations to launch.\n\n\nThe legal basis for the crackdown on universities centers on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in programs or activities — including universities — that receive federal funding. … Under the law, she said, “withdrawal of federal funds is treated as a last resort action.” … In several high-profile cases, the Trump task force has skipped all these steps.\n\n\nNYTimes: Fired D.E.I.

And she said that there was racial bias in what she called the unusual process that the public university used to investigate the complaint and in its decision to side with her accusers.\n\n\n“Historically, Black women have been subjected to stereotypes that portray them as confrontational or untrustworthy,” Ms. Dawson wrote during a disciplinary review, according to her lawsuit.\n\n\nIn her lawsuit, Ms. Dawson said she was approached in March 2024 at an American Association of Colleges and Universities diversity conference by the two professors who accused the University of Michigan of fostering an antisemitic climate. Ms. Dawson’s suit says she disagreed with the women and explained the university’s efforts to combat antisemitism, including the creation of a center for that purpose. The women, the suit says, asked if she believed Palestinians had a right to live in the region of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She said she did, according to the suit. “This apparently infuriated the two women,” the lawsuit says. “They were so angry that they followed Ms. Dawson out of the room and refused to let her exit the conversation.”\n\n\n\n\nCongress Shows Resistance to Trump’s Plan to Slash Science Budgets\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/07/21/congress-shows-resistance-trumps-science-budget\n\nCongress’s proposed budgets would preserve more research spending than the president’s. It’s a rare rebuke from Republicans to the White House’s efforts to gut funding for several research support agencies.\n\n\nIn a July 10 Senate Appropriations Committee meeting, legislators put forth a cut to the National Science Foundation (NSF) of only $16 million compared to the more than $5 billion proposed by Trump. Four days later, a House Appropriations Committee subcommittee suggested slashing $2 billion—less than half of Trump’s proposal.\n\n\nHe [Roger Pielke, AEI] said the NSF, which focuses on basic research, may be more insulated from political fights than agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which deals with climate science, and the National Institutes of Health, which deals with vaccines. The congressional appropriations committees haven’t yet indicated what they plan to do with Trump’s proposed 38 percent cut to the NIH.\n\n(also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-proposed-slashing-the-national-science-foundations-budget-a-key-senate-committee-just-refused\n\nThe Senate Committee on Appropriations voted 19-10 on Thursday to keep funding for the National Science Foundation and other federal science agencies nearly intact for the 2026 fiscal year.\n\n\nFederal Grant Cuts Don’t Spare Red States, New Report Shows\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/07/23/feds-axed-grants-across-red-blue-states-report-finds\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nThe Trump administration’s cancellation of federal funds for highly selective universities in blue states has drawn national media attention. But a new report from a left-leaning think tank stresses that the federal government isn’t targeting only Harvard and Columbia’s research and innovation grants.\n\n\n“Republican- and Democrat-governed states are facing similar impacts relative to their student populations in terms of funding terminated by the administration,” says the Center for American Progress’s report, released today. And no institution is safe, CAP notes.\n\n\n“Institutions affected by grant terminations range from some of the country’s largest public universities to private research universities, small liberal arts colleges, and community colleges,” the report says. Land-grant universities and historically Black colleges and universities “have been particularly affected, with more than two-thirds of all land-grant universities and nearly half of all HBCUs targeted for funding terminations.”\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal investigations target college aid to immigrants and minorities - The Washington Post\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/23/college-scholarships-investigation-immigrants-minorities/\n\nThe inquiry will examine complaints from the conservative Equal Protection Project that the schools engaged in discrimination by allegedly showing a preference for foreign-born students. The schools named in the complaint are the University of Louisville, the University of Nebraska Omaha, the University of Miami, the University of Michigan and Western Michigan University.\n\n\nMost of the scholarships in question offer financial support for either undocumented students or those covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. Neither group is eligible to receive federal grants or loans to attend college, making institutional, state and private grants critical for their ability to access higher education.\n\n\nConservative activists and Republican state leaders have pushed colleges to abandon scholarships earmarked for underrepresented groups, arguing that the same principles underlying the Supreme Court’s ban on colleges considering an applicant’s race as a factor in admissions apply to financial aid.\n\n\nThe Equal Protection Project, led by Cornell University clinical law professor William Jacobson, has been at the forefront of that movement by filing dozens of complaints against race-conscious scholarships with the Office for Civil Rights. The group has expanded its effort by taking a look at institutional aid provided to foreign-born students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe Helped Lead a Disgraced College Accreditor. Under Trump, He Might Have Another Shot.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/he-helped-lead-a-disgraced-college-accreditor-under-trump-he-might-have-another-shot\n\nA decade ago, over 200 college campuses shuttered in a two-year period, leaving thousands of students in the lurch. … In 2022, the organization that accredited many of the campuses run by those companies — the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, or ACICS — was effectively shut down by the U.S. Department of Education for not responding to the concerns. The department’s withdrawal of its recognition ended a battle spanning three U.S. presidencies.\n\n\nBut in higher education as in politics, there’s often déjà vu. Anthony Bieda, a longtime ACICS executive, is back in the accreditation game at a pivotal point in the federal recalibrating of higher ed.\n\n\nBieda is hoping to help shake up the sector with what he described to The Chronicle as a holistic, AI-assisted, anti-woke approach to measuring student success through the National Association for Academic Excellence, or NAAE. He sees metrics like post-graduate earnings as limiting. Instead, the NAAE member institutions will be evaluated based on how their education influences the “formation of the human person.”\n\n\nStill, disrupting the accreditation system requires contending with a web of regulations and yearslong processes. And for Bieda’s NAAE to enter the marketplace, colleges will have to buy what it’s selling.\n\n\nThe Obama administration initially pulled recognition of ACICS in 2016; the Trump administration reinstated it in 2018 after a favorable court ruling. Then, in 2020, a USA Today investigation found that ACICS had accredited a university that was little more than an empty office, with no evidence of enrolled students or employed faculty. In 2021, the Biden administration went after ACICS again; in 2022, the Education Department rejected the accreditor’s appeal and revoked its recognition, this time for good.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump vs. Harvard: A timeline of how the fight escalated\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/2025/timeline-trump-harvard/\n\nThe Trump administration’s battle with Harvard University will be aired in court Monday, when a federal judge will hear arguments in the school’s lawsuit challenging the government’s attack on its federal research funding.\n\n\nJan. 9, 2025: Justice Department pick signals focus on Harvard\n\n\nFeb. 3: Trump administration alleges antisemitic incidents at university graduations; Trump administration announces formation of its antisemitism task force; March 8: Trump task force chair says universities have been ‘hijacked’ by leftists\n\n\nMarch 10: Trump administration investigates 60 schools for alleged antisemitism\n\n\nMarch 31: More than $8.7 billion in funding to Harvard is put under review\n\n(etc.)\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration and Harvard Face Crucial Court Test\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/us/trump-administration-harvard-hearing.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBoth Harvard and the government are asking Judge Allison D. Burroughs for summary judgment — a ruling that would decide the lawsuit, at least in Judge Burroughs’s court, without a trial.\n\n\nHarvard will argue on Monday that the Trump administration is trying to curb its First Amendment rights. Judge Burroughs sided with the university in another significant case, when she ruled on several interim matters related to the government’s effort to block the school from enrolling international students.\n\n\nThe university’s lawyers argued in a court filing last month that the government’s tactics amounted to “unconstitutional retaliation against Harvard for exercising its First Amendment rights to decide what to teach, to express certain views and to petition the courts to defend itself.”\n\n\nHarvard also said that the Trump administration’s hurried approach to cutting funding defied federal law and regulations, and its actions were “arbitrary and capricious.” The school has argued that the government’s decision to cancel funding across disciplines has little connection to the problems it wants to address, including antisemitism.\n\n*Judge Challenges Trump Administration in Hearing on Harvard Funding - The New York Times\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/us/trump-administration-harvard-hearing.html\n\nIn a courtroom in Boston on Monday, a lawyer for Harvard called the Trump administration’s case against the school “cooked up.”\n\n\nA federal judge appeared deeply skeptical on Monday of the Trump administration’s efforts to strip Harvard University of billions of dollars in research funding, suggesting the school might prevail in its legal battle against the government.\n\n\nJudge Allison D. Burroughs did not issue a ruling during a crucial hearing, which lasted more than two hours in her courtroom in Boston. But she did seem receptive to Harvard’s arguments, as both the school and the government sought to have the case decided in their favor without a trial.\n\n\n“You’re saying you can terminate a contract for any and all reasons, even if the reason you’re giving is a violation of the Constitution?” Judge Burroughs asked Mr. Velchik [team Govt] at one point, her doubts made clear by her tone. At another moment, she said, “I don’t think you can justify a contract action based on impermissible suppression of speech.”\n\n\nJudge Burroughs seemed to share the worries of Mr. Lehotsky, who said the government was pursuing an “anti-Harvard policy” that would be unlawful under any president.\n\n\n“What I’m wrestling with is this idea that the executive branch can decide what is discriminatory or racist,” she said, and then make “these ad hoc decisions without any procedure around it.”\n\n\nPresident Trump, in a social media post after the hearing, called Judge Burroughs “a TOTAL DISASTER, which I say even before hearing her Ruling.”\n\n\nHe also criticized Harvard, and reiterated promises to end its federal funds. “When she rules against us, we will IMMEDIATELY appeal, and WIN,” he wrote of Judge Burroughs. “Also, the Government will stop the practice of giving many Billions of Dollars to Harvard, much of which had been given without explanation.”\n\n(Yeah, right)\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/22/judge-appears-skeptical-harvard-funding-cuts\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/in-a-key-court-showdown-with-harvard-trump-administration-encounters-a-skeptical-judge\n(Also)\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/21/trump-harvard-hearing/\n(Also)\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-trump-court-lawsuit-analysis-6022851b?st=MuZSoj&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(But the Journal is going to Journal and has)\n\nHarvard’s odds to win its Boston court battle look favorable—but the larger war is up in the air.\n\n\nLegal analysts say Harvard has a strong case in arguing that the U.S. government improperly cut $2.2 billion in federal funding from the Ivy League school.

One of his finest compositions, entitled “Don’t Deal with the Devil,” opens with the following warning:\n\n\nWhen you dealin’ with the devil Everything you do is wrong You’ll drive away your lover And keep all your things in pawn… Don’t deal with the devil, cuz it ain’t no way to win.\n\n\nColumbia’s fundamental error was its failure to recognize that from the moment Max Eden of the American Enterprise Institute wrote, last December, that the Department of Education “should simply destroy Columbia University,” it was engaged not in a negotiation but in a war for survival. One would have thought that the futility of its initial capitulation — no restoration of funds followed by a series of further attacks — would have sent a clear signal, but apparently it did not.\n\n\nOne has only to read the recent “Manhattan Statement on Higher Education” — likely authored by the indefatigable Christopher Rufo and signed by an anti-woke dream team — to see that the right-wing attack on the autonomy of higher education is just getting started and that neither Columbia nor other universities will be spared further damage.\n\n\nThe Manhattan Statement is purportedly about reform, but its language — “corrupt,” “nihilism,” “tyranny,” — is the language of revolution. It is somehow unsurprising that “child sex-trait modification” manages to find its way into a description of the evils of higher education. Two hundred million dollars will not stop, will barely slow down, the ideologues at the gates.\n\nNYTimes: Columbia’s Administrators Are Fooling Themselves\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/opinion/trump-columbia-deal-professor.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn economic history, we teach the 1688 creation of parliamentary supremacy as a solution to what economists call “commitment problems.” In the absence of a third party sufficiently strong to make sure all sides stick to their promises, the powerful can renege on the powerless. The powerless, seeing this, wisely choose to not contract with the powerful. Absolutist rulers are victims of their own lack of restraints; a sovereign who is too powerful cannot get inexpensive credit, because nothing stops the ruler from defaulting on any bond. President Trump, by smashing checks on his authority, has wound up undermining his own ability to make credible deals, including the one just reached with Columbia University, where I teach.\n\n\nBut this deal is unlikely to end the attacks. The federal government, and this administration, is simply too powerful and too arbitrary to be credibly bargained with. Do we really think this arrangement, however destructive of academic autonomy it is, will prevent the Trump administration from stopping the money again? Anyone who thinks the administration will mutely walk away after the ink is dry needs to look at both the past behavior of autocratic regimes in general and this administration’s in particular.\n\n\nIt is unsurprising that a coalition of election deniers, Christian nationalists and supplement- and crypto-hawkers would have little regard for academic freedom, scientific progress and learning. It was always a stretch for Columbia to think a good-faith agreement was in the cards, but when the government is too often behaving unchecked by the law, the idea of a binding contract is a fantasy.\n\n\nColumbia University Settlement an Unprecedented Disaster | AAUP\n\nhttps://www.aaup.org/news/columbia-university-settlement-unprecedented-disaster\n\nThe Columbia University Board of Trustees’ concessions to the Trump administration are a disaster for Columbia students, faculty, and staff, as well as for academic freedom, freedom of speech, and the independence of colleges and universities nationwide. Never in the history of our nation has an educational institution so thoroughly bent to the will of an autocrat. The settlement will only fuel Trump’s authoritarian appetite to control other democratic institutions that could potentially rein him in. This settlement subverts our democracy and capitulates to the Trump plan to target the pillars of our democracy: the judiciary, the free press, and our education systems.\n\n\nAllowing the government to monitor and ultimately dictate decisions about the hiring of faculty and admission of students is a stunning breach of the independence of colleges and universities and opens the door for the ideological control this administration so eagerly craves. This is an extremely dangerous precedent that will have tremendous consequences for the sector. Trump has already reached into community colleges, public state schools, small liberal arts colleges, and minority serving institutions to limit the free expression of students and workers. The Columbia settlement will embolden the administration to further clamp down throughout higher education.\n\n\nAn authoritarian bully will not be satisfied with just one trophy at Columbia University. For higher education to function, students, staff, and faculty must be free to think and speak their minds. All who care about higher education must stand up and fight back against this unprecedented continuing assault. To preserve our democracy, we have no choice. –AAUP president Todd Wolfson\n\n\nColumbia Deal a ‘Threat’ to Higher Ed, Experts Warn\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/25/columbia-settlement-offers-warning-higher-ed\n\nColumbia’s capitulation “represents the upending of a decades-long partnership between the government and higher education in which colleges and universities nevertheless retained academic freedom, institutional autonomy and shared governance,” said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities. “It signals a rise in authoritarian populism in which higher education is positioned as the enemy in a fight against corrupt, inefficient and elite institutions that are out of touch with the needs of the working class.”\n\n\n“Whether you applaud or despise the terms of the deal, the way in which the government is operating, and getting universities like Columbia to make these deals is fundamentally coercive,” said David Pozen, a constitutional law professor at Columbia. “Therefore, it poses a significant threat to the future of higher education as well as the rule of law.”\n\n\n“The very real danger is that if elite institutions choose to submit to the authority of the Trump administration, the whole rest of the industry will follow,” said Kevin Carey, vice president of education and work at New America, a left-leaning think tank. “It will be like a stack of dominoes one falling after the other.”\n\n\nWill Creeley, legal director of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said that, in addition to admission practices, this settlement and its “blatant disregard for federal law” will upend academia’s core commitment to fostering First Amendment rights.\n\n\nMichael Thaddeus, a Columbia math professor and president of the faculty union chapter, said though administrators insist they won’t allow the government to interfere, that assurance doesn’t mean such acts won’t occur. “Students and scholars at American universities must be free to think and speak their minds,” he wrote in a statement to Inside Higher Ed. “The settlement … risks imperiling this freedom.”\n\n\nPozen, the Columbia law professor, outlined in a blog post Wednesday night how the task force bypassed nearly all statutory requirements of such an investigation. … “The means being used to push through these reforms are as unprincipled as they are unprecedented,” Pozen wrote. “Higher education policy in the United States is now being developed through ad hoc deals, a mode of regulation that is not only inimical to the ideal of the university as a site of critical thinking but also corrosive to the democratic order and to law itself.”\n\n\nKirsten Weld, a history professor and president of the Harvard faculty union chapter, said she is “very concerned” and rejects any suggestion that Columbia’s settlement should be a “blueprint” for her own institution’s negotiations.\n\n\nTed Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, also suggested via email that “this cannot be a template for the government’s approach to American higher education.” This administration “reached a conclusion before an investigation and levied a penalty without affording Columbia due process—that is chilling,” he wrote. “This administration must return to following the rule of law.”\n\n\nWhat Columbia’s Settlement Stipulates\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/executive-leadership/2025/07/24/breaking-down-columbia-us-settlement-trump-admin\n\nColumbia will see at least a partial restoration of federal research funds.\n\n\nThe agreement will close pending investigations or compliance reviews related to potential violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race or national origin. That includes a probe by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission into the treatment of Jewish employees at Columbia. Of the $221 million settlement, $21 million will go toward the EEOC complaint.\n\n\nColumbia will maintain policies announced in March that deem protests inside of academic buildings and related spaces to be a “direct impediment” to the university’s academic mission.\n\n\nThe agreement codifies changes to disciplinary processes announced in March, such as placing the University Judicial Board under the Office of the Provost who reports to the president. Students previously served on the board, but now, it will be restricted to faculty and staff members.\n\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, a frequent target of the Trump administration, are also included in the agreement. The deal bars Columbia from maintaining “programs that promote unlawful efforts to achieve race-based outcomes, quotas, diversity targets, or similar efforts.”\n\n\nThe agreement emphasizes merit-based admissions and bars Columbia from giving preference to applicants due to “race, color, or national origin.” It also prevents Columbia from using personal statements, diversity narratives or references to race “to introduce or justify discrimination.”\n\n\nMaintaining a senior vice provost to provide greater administrative oversight of Middle East studies (and other regional programs), as initially announced in March, is also part of the agreement.\n\n\nAs part of the deal, a third-party resolution monitor will police the agreement. Bart Schwartz, co-founder of Guidepost Solutions and former Chief of the Criminal Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, will serve in that role.\n\n\nThe deal also places restrictions on university hiring processes. Columbia’s agreement will bar the use of “personal statements, diversity narratives, or any applicant reference to racial identity as a means to introduce or justify discriminatory practices in hiring or promotion.” Other unspecified “indirect methods or criteria that serve as a substitute for race conscious hiring or promotion practices” are also prohibited per the deal.\n\n\nWhile some elements of the agreement are new, other parts simply codify prior changes. For example, changes to disciplinary processes, and greater administrative oversight of Middle East studies (and other regional programs) already announced in March are now codified in the deal.\n\n\n‘The Best Day Higher Ed Has Had in a Year’ – Larry Summers\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-best-day-higher-ed-has-had-in-a-year\n(Why the led with this take, who knows, I couldn’t read it.)\n\nColumbia Struck a Deal to Save Research Funding. How Do Its Researchers Feel About That?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/columbia-struck-a-deal-to-save-research-funding-how-do-its-researchers-feel-about-that\n(They lead off with:)\n\nFor Gerard Karsenty, chair of the genetics department, the feeling is one of “joy and relief.” “If this is the price to pay for me to be able to work and my students not to go and sell shoes at Walmart, I think I can live with that,” Karsenty said.\n\n\nDixon-Román’s [Director of the Edmund W. Gordon Institute for Urban and Minority Education at the Teachers College] biggest worry about the agreement lies in an assumption that the federal government will act in good faith. “You’re playing with an administration that has shown bad faith in relation to the rule of law, let alone even other agreements.”\n\n\nTucked Into Columbia’s Deal With Trump: A Restriction on International Enrollments\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tucked-into-columbias-deal-with-trump-a-restriction-on-international-enrollments\n\nThe requirement to study its policies for international admissions is among the terms of Columbia’s 22-page agreement with the government. The provision states that university will ask questions about why international students want to study in the United States as part of the admissions process.\n\n\nColumbia also consents to making sure that all students, international and domestic, are “committed to the longstanding traditions of American universities,” including free inquiry, open debate, and the “fundamental values” of equality and respect. It will create training materials so that students understand campus norms and values. The Trump administration has repeatedly suggested that international students have been the leaders and provocateurs behind pro-Palestinian protests that rocked Columbia and other campuses.\n\n\nWhat Columbia Just Threw Away\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-columbia-just-threw-away\n\nAnd that’s also why I’m outraged by Columbia University’s agreement yesterday with the Trump administration. There’s no other way to put it: Columbia abandoned free and open dialogue — the most fundamental principle of academic life — to save its own skin.\n\n\nBut here’s the problem: Reasonable people disagree about what kinds of statements and behaviors constitute anti-Jewish hatred. And Columbia has effectively placed that disagreement out of bounds.\n\n\nSo let’s suppose a professor declares that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, like the Nazis did in Europe. Would Columbia declare the statement antisemitic and subject the professor to disciplinary action? How about a staff member who says that “Zionism is racism”? Or a student who chants, “From the river to the sea, Palestine must be free”? You might view all of these statements as antisemitic. And depending on who is talking and listening, I might agree with you.\n\n\nBut I cannot — and will not — abide by a university that restricts our discussion of the matter.\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Walked a Tightrope on Its Way to a $200 Million Settlement With Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/25/nyregion/how-columbia-reached-a-deal.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nSo Ms. Shipman sought what she called the “seeds” of truth in matters cited by the White House, including what it perceived as an academic orthodoxy on campus or an inability to hear other voices. She and Columbia’s other leaders told themselves that they could negotiate a deal with Trump to address things on campus that they agreed were broken, so long as it didn’t cross their red lines and compromise academic freedom.\n\n\nNYTimes: Did Columbia’s Deal With Trump Save Its Stature or Sacrifice It?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/nyregion/columbia-trump-deal-reaction.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFrom the perspective of one longtime professor, a storied 270-year-old institution had capitulated to a bad-faith pressure campaign.\n\n(Then cue the both sides…and afterwards)\n\nLee C. Bollinger, the former president of Columbia, said that putting aside opinions on the university’s strategy, the Trump administration’s actions “cross several very serious, grave lines — legal, constitutional and basic norms.”\n\n\n“It’s a very sad moment. There’s no way around it,” Mr. Bollinger said, adding, “You have to come away feeling that this is really a tragedy for higher education and the country.”\n\n\nWhite House touts deal with Columbia as critics decry ‘chilling’ precedent\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/24/columbia-white-house-deal-implications-impacts/\n\nEducation lawyers and advocates said Columbia’s deal with the White House was a potentially dangerous government intrusion into higher education.\n\n\nIn agreeing to the deal, the elite Ivy League institution in New York City is entering uncharted territory: It is making an enormous payment to the federal government despite not admitting any wrongdoing while relinquishing a certain measure of oversight to an independent monitor.\n\n\nColumbia will pay a further $21 million to Jewish faculty and staff members to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Administration officials called it the largest such settlement ever for victims of antisemitism, and the largest in almost 20 years for any form of discrimination or harassment.\n\n\nThe deal that the Trump administration struck with Columbia on Wednesday is a blueprint for negotiations with other universities, a White House official said\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-columbia-trump-white-house-fines-payment-deal-settlement-d61aa9c6?st=kpHHY1&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nThe administration is in talks with several universities, including Cornell, Duke, Northwestern and Brown, the person familiar with the talks said, though it sees striking a deal with Harvard, America’s oldest university, as a key target. The White House hopes to extract hundreds of millions of dollars from Harvard, in a deal that would make Columbia’s $200 million payment look like peanuts, the person said.\n\n\n\n\n(These come from EI via Rutgers)\n\nTim Kaine speaks to students:\n\nhttps://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/07/sen-tim-kaine-speaks-to-uva-students-discusses-ryan-resignation-and-more\n\nLetter from 12 Deans to Board of Visitors goes unanswered for two weeks (the article includes a link to the letter sent)\n\nhttps://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/07/letter-from-11-deans-to-board-of-visitors-goes-unanswered-for-almost-two-weeks\n\nUVA Faculty Senate adopts no confidence vote in Board of Visitors\n\nhttps://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/07/uva-faculty-senate-overwhelmingly-adopts-a-no-confidence-vote-in-board-of-visitors\nA statement by Jewish UVA staff and faculty on antisemitism and DEI at UVA\n\nhttps://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/07/a-statement-by-40-jewish-faculty-and-staff-on-antisemitism-and-dei-at-uva\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Mason President Discriminated Against White People After George Floyd Protests, Justice Dept. Says\n\n(Yup, believe it or not)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/george-mason-president-discriminated-against-white-people-after-george-floyd-protests-justice-dept-says\n\nThe Justice Department on Thursday launched an investigation into George Mason University and its president, Gregory Washington, to determine if administrators discriminated against white male faculty and job applicants on the basis of race and sex in the aftermath of the George Floyd protests.\n\n\nIn a June 2020 email, when universities across the country were responding to the murder of George Floyd by looking for ways to address historic racial disparities on their campuses, Washington said he would make changes to the promotion and tenure processes that “recognize the invisible and uncredited emotional labor that people of color expend to learn, teach, discover, and work on campus.”\n\n\nThe department also cited a June 2022 post from Washington’s X account that celebrated DEI in the hiring process.\n\n\nNYTimes: In Virginia, the Attack on University Presidents Widens\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/us/virginia-university-presidents-dei-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nTrump administration widens probes into Virginia’s largest public university\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/22/justice-department-george-mason-investigation-dei/\n\nThe Plot to Oust the President of George Mason University – This campaign is not about policy. It’s about power.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-plot-to-oust-the-president-of-george-mason-university\n\nChristopher F. Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the mastermind behind the moral panic over “critical race theory,” has cemented his reputation as a relentless opponent of diversity, equity, and inclusion in higher education.\n\n\nHis hostility to DEI is matched by his influence among GOP decision-makers. He has organized campaigns against Claudine Gay, Harvard University’s first Black president, as well as several other Black administrators and faculty members at Harvard and other elite institutions. He helped oust Patricia Okker as president of New College of Florida and advocated for dismantling its Office of Outreach & Inclusive Excellence. Most recently, he led a successful campaign against Santa J. Ono, who was running to be the next president of the University of Florida.\n\n\nRufo’s playbook is now being used against Virginia’s public universities, with Gov. Glenn A. Youngkin, a Republican, setting the table for a federal takedown. Youngkin’s strategy has two main parts. First, he has appointed political ideologues to university governing boards and encouraged them to impose their ideology to remake higher education in Virginia. Second, alongside the attorney general, he has weakened public universities’ ability to respond to federal investigations that threaten the very mission of their institutions.\n\n\nWe recently watched this play out at the University of Virginia, where Youngkin-appointed board members and conservative alumni groups demanded the removal of all traces of DEI programs from the campus. Then came the Department of Justice investigation led by Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for the civil-rights division, and her deputy, Gregory W. Brown, both of whom are graduates of UVa. With the board unwilling to defend him and the threat that the university would lose millions of federal dollars, UVa’s president, James E. Ryan, resigned. Existential terror, indeed.\n\n\nFirst, over the past three years, George Mason has faced significant criticism from the staff of the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Education Policy, which has been led by Lindsey M. Burke for over eight years. Recently, Burke was appointed to the U.S. Department of Education. When she was chair of the George Mason board’s Academic Affairs Committee, Burke leveraged criticism from her colleagues at Heritage to justify her ongoing attacks on the university’s curriculum and its commitment to DEI.\n\n\nThe same strategy was employed to incorporate the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism into George Mason’s nondiscrimination policy without knowledge or input from faculty members. George Mason adopted this contentious definition, which critics argue conflates antisemitism with criticism of the State of Israel, under the influence of Kenneth Marcus, a former member of the university’s Board of Visitors who was appointed by Youngkin. (Marcus’s appointment has since been denied by the Democratic-controlled Virginia Legislature.) Marcus is also credited with facilitating the adoption of the IHRA definition at Harvard and Columbia. His overarching goal is to embed the IHRA definition in university discrimination policies nationwide, silencing criticism of Israel and suppressing speech in support of the Palestinian people.\n\n\nOn that same day, July 2, City Journal, a publication of the Manhattan Institute, published a column by Ian Kingsbury, a senior fellow at the Educational Freedom Institute, titled “George Mason University’s Disastrous President.” Citing a debunked Heritage-authored anti-DEI study and the Education Department’s threadbare allegations of antisemitism on campus, Kingsbury called for Washington’s ouster.\n\n\nThe interconnections among the players in this little piece of political theater boggle the mind. For example, the Heritage Foundation’s Jay P. Greene wrote the report, since debunked by George Mason administrators, on “DEI bloat” that Kingsbury cited in his City Journal hit piece. It turns out that Jay Greene was a member of Kingsbury’s doctoral committee, and they frequently collaborate on articles. Greene is also a fellow at the Education Freedom Institute, where Lindsey Burke once served as a board member. Until recently, Greene also worked for Burke at the Heritage Foundation. Around and around we go.\n\n\nOn July 3, the right-wing site Liberty Unyielding published a critique of George Mason … On July 4, National Review published a piece by George Leef, director of external affairs at the conservative James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal, referencing the Liberty Unyielding story … Based on this circular, self-referential discourse, Bacon’s Rebellion, a conservative political blog run by James A. Bacon, then posted an article predicting that George Mason could be the next university to be investigated by the Department of Justice\n\n\nAll of this is part of the strategy Rufo laid bare in an interview with Politico — publish relentless character assassination attacks in right-wing media until mainstream outlets feel they can no longer ignore the allegations, however specious or trivial.\n\n\nLet’s be clear: This campaign against George Mason and its president isn’t about antisemitism or so-called reverse racism. It’s about political control — plain and simple. … They don’t want independent thought — they seek obedience.\n\n\nThis is the Rufo doctrine in action: fabricate a crisis, flood the zone with misinformation, start coordinated media attacks, trigger federal investigations, and force institutions to collapse under the weight of bad-faith pressure. It worked at UVa. They want it to work at George Mason. If we allow it to happen again, we’re not just losing a president — we’re handing over the keys of public higher education to a political movement that views knowledge as a threat and diversity as a sin.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica First Legal Urges DOJ to Investigate Hopkins for DEI\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/21/america-first-legal-urges-doj-investigate-hopkins-dei\n\nIn a 133-page complaint filed Thursday, the conservative legal group, run by President Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, urged the DOJ to investigate Johns Hopkins “for its systemic, intentional, and ongoing discrimination within its School of Medicine on the basis of race, sex, ethnicity, national origin, and other impermissible, immutable characteristics under the pretext of ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (‘DEI’) in open defiance” of civil rights laws, Supreme Court precedent and presidential executive orders.\n\n\nThe America First Legal complaint singles out certain medical school divisions and programs for seeking to recruit a “diverse applicant pool,” including residency programs in gynecology and obstetrics, emergency medicine, dermatology, anesthesiology and critical care.\n\n\n“It seems like this is orchestrated,” Washington said in a July 9 interview with The Chronicle. “The same people who are kind of aligned that got rid of Jim Ryan are aligned against me.”\n\n\nIn Washington’s email on Friday, he maintained that diversity is integral to GMU’s mission. “Any attempt to artificially redefine our diversity, as one of race-based exclusivity, is doomed to fail no matter who ends up being excluded.”\n\n\n\n\n\nStaffing Shortages at ED Hurt College Operations\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/07/21/how-mass-layoffs-education-dept-affect-colleges\n\nBefore the Department of Education laid off half its staff in March, college financial aid officers on the west coast could typically help a student track down their missing login information for the federal aid application in a matter of minutes.\n\n\nBut now, due to limited hours of agency operation, tracking down a student’s Federal Student Aid ID can take days or even weeks; an east coast-based help line, which used to be open until 8 p.m. now closes at 3 p.m.—or noon Pacific time, according to Diane Cooper, the senior financial aid officer at Northwest Career College in Las Vegas.\n\n\nCongress Cut a Federal Nutrition Program, Jeopardizing Campus Jobs and Community Services\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/congress-cut-a-federal-nutrition-program-jeopardizing-campus-jobs-and-community-services\n\nSuperShelf is one of the thousands of initiatives funded by grants from the Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education, or SNAP-Ed. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed this month, eliminates funding for SNAP-Ed, effective September 30, leaving Durgan and hundreds of researchers and educators scrambling to figure out what these cuts mean for their institutions, and the communities they serve.\n\n\nThe University of Minnesota announced July 7 that it would not renew the contracts of 59 educators who work in its extension. The federal program isn’t the extension’s only source of funds, but Durgan said she expects more layoffs as the fall approaches. “We served over 173,000 individuals last year with this program and most of it will be ending at the end of September,” Durgan said. “It just will.”\n\n\nJennifer McCaffrey, assistant dean for the family and consumer sciences programs at the University of Illinois Extension, said she expects many partner organizations to suffer because of the cuts to SNAP-Ed. In Illinois, for example, she said SNAP-Ed is the primary distributor of venison. In the most recent hunting season, it sent 25,000 pounds of the game meat to food pantries statewide, feeding nearly 50,000 families. No other organization has the capacity to carry out such a service, she said, meaning a likely increase in both food waste and hunger across the state.\n\n\nBeyond the partner organizations themselves, McCaffrey said the state’s overall nutrition and health will suffer as well. The extension used SNAP-Ed funding to carry out initiatives named in the state’s health improvement plan, she added. “So we’re unsure where we’re turning to.”\n\n\nKamaljeet Khaira, director of the University of California CalFresh Healthy Living program, said losing SNAP-Ed came as a shock given the Trump administration’s stated goal of improving Americans’ health.\n\n\n\n\n\nNIH to Limit AI Use, Cap P.I. Grant Applications at 6 per Year\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/07/22/nih-limit-ai-use-cap-grant-applications-6-year\n\nThe announcement noted that the NIH has “recently observed instances of Principal Investigators submitting large numbers of applications, some of which may have been generated with AI tools,” adding that the use of such tools has enabled some P.I.s “to submit more than 40 distinct applications in a single application submission round.” Michael Lauer, who retired in February as the NIH’s deputy director for extramural research, said he had once seen this happen, Science reported.\n\n\nInstructors Will Now See AI Throughout a Widely Used Course Software\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/instructors-will-now-see-ai-throughout-a-widely-used-course-software\n\nOn the Canvas platform, faculty members will be able to click an icon that connects them with various AI features aimed at streamlining and aiding instructional workload, like a grading tool, a discussion-post summarizer, and a generator for image alternative text.\n\n\nCanvas’s parent company, Instructure, is also in partnership with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, so instructors can use generative-AI technology as part of their assignments.\n\n\nSome worry that integrating AI into the grading and course-planning process might eliminate the need for adjunct instructors and could expand class sizes. Ruediger noted that in online courses, there is already “a level of technology mediating between instructors and their students,” a gap that might only widen and make it more difficult for students to know if their instructor has personally evaluated their work.\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

She pushed for disciplining law professor Ramzi Kassem on the grounds that he represented Mahmoud Khalil, and Saly Abd Alla, the university’s chief diversity officer, over her past work as a civil rights director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Minnesota.\n\n\n“Does it concern you that New York taxpayers are paying for the legal defense fund of Mahmoud Khalil?” she asked Matos Rodríguez.\n\n\nMatos Rodríguez said he was not familiar with those individual employees, but stressed that any employee who violates CUNY’s rules will be investigated. He said CUNY had no complaints related to Abd Alla and that she is not directly involved with handling cases related to students and faculty.\n\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters repeatedly interrupted the hearing. As Matos Rodríguez spoke, one person yelled, “Israel is burning children alive.” Later in the hearing, another protester also shouted to disrupt Matos Rodríguez’s remarks, prompting Rep. Randy Fine (R-Fla.) to say, “Shut up and get out of here… get out of here you loser.”\n\n\nRep. Alma Adams (D-N.C.) relayed to the chancellor CUNY faculty members’ concerns about professors who were not reappointed despite having fully enrolled classes scheduled for the fall. “As a former professor myself and a department chair — somebody who believes deeply in transparency and fairness — I want to ask you: would you be willing to follow up with my office and provide more information on the policies and procedures that guide faculty appointments and reappointments at CUNY?” she asked. Matos Rodríguez said he was willing to cooperate fully with the committee.\n\n\n“These hearings are political theater. That’s all they are,” said David Cole, a Georgetown Law professor who testified in his capacity as an expert on the First Amendment at an earlier hearing in May. “It almost doesn’t matter what the university presidents say… there is no effort to even determine what the truth is, what actually happened, or whether any legal lines have been crossed.”\n\n\nCUNY’s Repression of Pro-Palestine Students Continues in Front of Congress\n\nhttps://www.thenation.com/article/politics/cuny-house-republicans-hearing-repression/\n\nThe Professional Staff Congress—CUNY’s staff and faculty union—and many from the greater CUNY community are saying the hearing by House Republicans was really meant to silence CUNY’s advocates for Palestinian human rights. Matos-Rodriguez, they argue, failed to defend those community members, as well as the tenets of free speech and robust, open conversation that are critical components of a thriving academic institution. “It was an egregious abdication of his responsibility as an academic and his responsibility as a leader of an academic institution,” said Heba Gowayed, an associate professor of sociology at Hunter College.\n\n\nStefanik’s latest battle doesn’t fight antisemitism; it attacks due process\n\nhttps://thehill.com/opinion/education/5409278-elise-stefanik-targets-cuny-clear/\n\nStefanik’s latest target has been a legal clinic at the City University of New York School of Law, called CUNY CLEAR, an acronym for Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility.\n\n\nWhatever the merits of Stefanik’s other accusations, she is absolutely wrong about CUNY CLEAR. Representation of a controversial client is in the best tradition of legal education.\n\n\nOutraged that CUNY CLEAR had played a key role in Khalil’s representation, Stefanik called upon Rodriguez to fire the CUNY professor who coordinated the defense.\n\n\nRodriguez was non-committal, promising only to investigate the situation. That was the tactful response, but he missed a teachable moment.\n\n\nAlthough that may never be acceptable to Stefanik, Rodriguez should have explained that representing unpopular clients is what lawyers are supposed to do, and what law students should be taught to do.\n\n\nI [Steven Lubet, opinion contributor] agree with almost nothing Khalil stands for, but I believe strongly in due process and fair trials. There is no right to appointed counsel in immigration cases, so Khalil’s representation could only come from organizations such as the ACLU and CLEAR.",

    "text": "NYS AAUP sends letter to BC President\n\n\nDear President Anderson,\n\n\nWe are writing to express concern about the recent firing and non-renewals of four Brooklyn College adjunct faculty members, recently addressed in statements by the Professional Staff Congress-CUNY and CUNY University Faculty Senate leadership.\n\n\nWhile the Brooklyn College administration and the CUNY Board of Trustees have the power of review and final decision, faculty have primacy in academic decision-making, including matters of faculty status. This principle is clearly established in the 1940 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities, jointly formulated by the American Association of University Professors, the American Council on Education (ACE), and the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges (AGB).\n\n\nAccording to the 1940 Statement faculty have primary responsibility in decisions related to: “appointments, reappointments, decisions not to reappoint, promotions, the granting of tenure, and dismissal….The governing board and president should, on questions of faculty status, as in other matters where the faculty has primary responsibility, concur with the faculty judgment except in rare instances and for compelling reasons which should be stated in\n\n\nWe appreciate this is an ongoing personnel matter and wish to respect the privacy of the faculty members involved. However, it appears that neither these individuals nor the departments that recommended their renewal for the coming academic year have been informed of the reasons for their dismissal or non-renewal. Without stated reasons, faculty cannot effectively respond to the administration, as required by AAUP standards of shared governance.\n\n\nIf the Brooklyn College administration has not already done so, we encourage you to clearly communicate the reasons for the non-renewals and firing for cause to the individual faculty members and their departments as well as to allow them the opportunity to respond following Brooklyn College governance procedures.\n\nThis letter references one sent by the UFS XC and co-chairs of the UFS AF committee:\n\nDear President Anderson,\n\n\nThe University Faculty Senate Executive Committee has been notified of potential academic freedom issues on your campus. It has been reported to us that four adjunct faculty were not reappointed after receiving recommendations from their respective departments and chairpersons. We would hope that the reports of non-reappointment are due to extracurricular political expressions are not the case.\n\n\nWhile the UFS does not represent any faculty in contract compliance manners, we do defend academic freedom vigorously. In particular, we take the lead of the AAUP which in 2018 reaffirmed “That there should be no invidious distinction between those who teach and/or conduct research in higher education, regardless of whether they hold full-time or part-time appointments or whether their appointments are tenured, tenure-track, or contingent. All faculty members should have access to the same due-process protections and procedures.”\n\n\nFurther, we follow the AAUP statement on governance where it states, “The governing board and president should, on questions of faculty status, as in other matters where the faculty have primary responsibility, concur with the faculty judgment except in rare instances and for compelling reasons which should be stated in detail.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Hundreds of NASA Employees, Past and Present, Sign Letter of Formal Dissent\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/science/nasa-formal-dissent-letter-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nA public letter from NASA employees on Monday urges leaders of the space agency not to carry out deep cuts sought by the Trump administration.\n\nhttps://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/06e6b87deb245d66/67ef9b90-full.pdf\n\n“We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety, scientific advancement and efficient use of public resources,” the employees wrote in the letter. It is addressed to Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, whom President Trump appointed this month as acting NASA administrator.\n\n\nThe NASA letter follows similar letters of criticism by federal employees at the National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency. Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the N.I.H. director, said he welcomed respectful dissent, but the E.P.A. placed 144 employees who signed that agency’s letter on leave.",

    "text": "The Dangers of the Manhattan Statement\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/columns/debatable-ideas/2025/07/22/dangers-manhattan-statement\n\nSomething that caught my eye last week was news of a statement calling for even more government control over higher education from a group of conservatives. This comes as the right fully embraces Donald Trump’s authoritarian commands against universities. Developed by Christopher Rufo of the Manhattan Institute, the Manhattan Statement was carefully designed using public polling to create vague, popular-sounding principles (“truth” “freedom of speech” “equality” “civil discourse” “transparency”) that obscure its plan for massive federal control over colleges and repression of dissent.\n\n\nThe Manhattan Statement is a recipe for tyranny. Even if some people might agree with its goals, what’s important are not the ends but the repressive means used to achieve them. It calls for “a new contract with the universities, which should be written into every grant, payment, loan, eligibility, and accreditation, and punishable by revocation of all public benefit.” We’ve already seen how the Trump regime has terribly, illicitly abused its power over government contracts to punish colleges without due process. The Manhattan Statement would vastly expand this power to include all federal funding and student loans, making every college held hostage for its existence to any demands of the government.\n\n\nInstead of pretending that “antisemitism” somehow justified cutting off federal funds in direct defiance of the due process required under Title VI, the Manhattan Statement would provide a wide array of reasons for political ideologues to destroy a college, with its amorphous calls to abolish “ideology” and “activism” and require “swift expulsion” of anyone deemed to violate “civil discourse.”\n\n\nIn recent years, many conservatives have abandoned their past commitments to free speech and the rejection of federal control over academia. … It’s disturbing to see so many thoughtful conservatives that I respect joining a call for massive expansion of government control over colleges.\n\n\nOne of the signers, Representative Virginia Foxx (R-NC), is a member (and former chair) of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, a sign that the Manhattan Statement is not some theoretical wish list aimed at reforming universities, but a very real political threat that could easily be enforced on colleges in the near future.\n\n\nHowever, even terrible legislation is too slow a process for these conservatives, who write that “we call on the President of the United States to draft a new contract with the universities” with these extraordinary requirements.\n\n\nTo legitimize government intrusion, the Manhattan Statement invents pure historical fiction\n\n(Well, I’d quote the whole thing, but I’ll stop here)\n\nWhat the Manhattan Statement claims to be the problem—“a new kind of tyranny—one in which ideology determines truth, and the university functions as a political agent …”—is, in fact, the perfect description of Rufo’s solution. He’s simply taking a deluded fantasy of left-wing tyranny on campus as a justification to impose a very real proposal for right-wing tyranny.\n\n\nNYTimes: I Watched It Happen in Hungary. Now It’s Happening Here.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/opinion/hungary-viktor-orban.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAfter years watching Hungary suffocate under the weight of its democratic collapse, I came to understand that the real danger of a strongman isn’t his tactics; it’s how others, especially those with power, justify their acquiescence.\n\n\nHungarians with little power or privilege to lose would occasionally protest. But those with power remained reliably, pliably silent.\n\n\nThe American officials and academics who, like me, lived in Hungary during this period would often tell ourselves stories to explain this submissiveness: that docility is rooted in Hungary’s oppressive Communist past, that its democracy was simply too young to withstand a strongman.\n\n\nThen I returned to the United States, and what I’ve witnessed over these past months at home has exposed those stories as wishful thinking.\n\n\nHere, too, powerful people are responding to authoritarian advances just as their Hungarian counterparts have — not with defiance, but with capitulation, convinced that they can maintain their independence and stay above the fray.\n\n\nThe lesson of Hungary is this: We cannot claim to care about democracy only when it costs nothing. President Trump, like Mr. Orban, no doubt believes that everyone can be bought. America’s elites are proving him right. There is a Hungarian phrase I heard often: “Van az a penz” — “There’s always a price.”",

It also called for institutions to give faculty members, staff and students the right to opt-out of technology use without negatively affecting their working or learning conditions, as well as allowing faculty to challenge the implementation of certain ed tech products if the benefit isn’t clear.",

The officials say they’re complying with new state prohibitions against diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n\nSB 125 also specifically requires the secretary to certify that agencies have “removed gender identifying pronouns or gender ideology from email signature blocks on state employee’s [sic] email accounts and any other form of communication.” The law doesn’t define DEI or gender ideology.\n\n\nRoss Marchand, program counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, told Inside Higher Ed the new Kansas law is unconstitutional.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the University of Kansas’s chancellor, provost and chief health sciences officer wrote to KU’s campuses that “all employees shall comply with this directive by removing gender-identifying pronouns and personal pronoun series from their KU email signature blocks, webpages and Zoom/Teams screen IDs, and any other form of university communications.”\n\n\nThe leaders also warned against efforts to circumvent the ban. “Your KU email account is your only official means for sending emails related to your employment at the university,” they wrote. “Do not use an alternate third-party service, such as Gmail, to conduct university business or communications.”\n\n\n\n\nThe Manhattan Statement on Higher Education\n\nhttps://manhattan.institute/article/the-manhattan-statement-on-higher-education\n(If others didn’t take them seriously, there would be no reason to read this. A sampling of their “facts” follows)\n\nThe universities have capitulated to the radical Left’s “long march through the institutions,” which has converted them into laboratories of ideology, rather than institutions oriented toward truth.\n\n\nThe universities have built enormous “diversity, equity, and inclusion” bureaucracies that discriminate on the basis of race and violate the fundamental principle of equality—that high prize which was inscribed in the Declaration of Independence and codified into law with the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act.\n\n\nThe universities have contributed to a new kind of tyranny, with publicly funded initiatives designed to advance the cause of digital censorship, public health lockdowns, child sex-trait modification, race-based redistribution, and other infringements on America’s long-standing rights and liberties.\n\n\nThe universities have corrupted faculty hiring practices with racial quotas, ideological filters, and diversity statements, which function as loyalty oaths to the Left and have virtually eliminated conservative scholars from the prestige institutions.\n\n\nThe universities have degraded the liberal arts with reductive ideologies that no longer aim to preserve and discover what is highest in man, but to unleash resentments against Western civilization, from the Greeks and Romans, to the English and the Americans.\n\n(The chaser)\n\nTo that end, we call on the President of the United States to draft a new contract with the universities, which should be written into every grant, payment, loan, eligibility, and accreditation, and punishable by revocation of all public benefit:\n\n(These include)\n\nThe universities must uphold the highest standard of civil discourse, with swift and significant penalties, including suspension and expulsion, for anyone who would disrupt speakers, vandalize property, occupy buildings, call for violence, or interrupt the operations of the university.\n\n\nThe universities must provide transparency about their operations and, at the end of each year, publish complete data on race, admissions, and class rank; employment and financial returns by major; and campus attitudes on ideology, free speech, and civil discourse.",

However, the secretary of Homeland Security is free to set the fee higher, according to the provision.\n\n\nA Trial Over Campus Protest Ends with Conflicting Views of Foreign Students’ Free-Speech Rights\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-trial-over-campus-protest-ends-with-conflicting-views-of-foreign-students-free-speech-rights\n\nGovernment lawyers dismissed allegations of an ideologically motivated campaign to detain and deport campus protesters on Monday, comparing assertions that the Trump administration curtailed the free-speech rights of noncitizens to the fictional character Don Quixote.\n\n\nPlaintiffs, including the American Association of University Professors and the Middle East Studies Association, argue that the March arrests of pro-Palestinian activists on student visas and green cards led other international students and scholars to think twice about speaking out on controversial issues. Academics testified that they had rewritten syllabi, withdrawn op-eds, and canceled research trips out of fear that they, too, could face retribution for expressing political opinions.\n\n\n“The goal is to chill speech, to silence students and scholars who wish to express pro-Palestinian views,” Alexandra Conlon, a lawyer for the academic groups, said during closing arguments. “It is stifling dissent.”\n\n\nBut Ethan B. Kanter, another lawyer representing the Trump administration, countered that noncitizens’ speech rights are “context dependent.” As an example, he pointed to federal campaign-finance law, which prohibits donations from foreign nationals. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that campaign spending is protected speech under the First Amendment. The campaign restrictions underscore that “not in every instance” do noncitizens have “equivalent rights,” Kanter said.\n\n\nArmstrong was questioned in particular about Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University graduate student whose visa revocation he directly approved. He said an op-ed critical of Israel that she co-authored was “not a key factor” in his decision. Yet the article was the only specific support he provided as evidence of her “activity and association” with Students for Justice in Palestine…Armstrong also testified that he did not recall being given “any concrete guidance” about what constitutes antisemitism, and he said did not know of formal training given to other State Department officials who reviewed protesters’ cases.\n\n\nArmstrong was part of at least 20 conversations with officials in the White House, Department of Homeland Security, and other agencies, including with Stephen Miller, deputy White House chief of staff and the president’s top adviser on immigration.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Student Arrests, and the Lawsuit Fighting Them, Tread New Ground\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/us/politics/trump-student-arrests-immigration-trial.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe four veteran immigration agents who recently took the stand in federal court had at least two things in common. All were career law enforcement officials. And none could remember ever being asked to make arrests like the ones they carried out earlier this year.\n\n\nThe men said they acted on orders handed down from Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s office in March to detain several noncitizen students, including a doctoral student from Tufts University whose arrest was captured on video and garnered significant attention. Mr. Rubio had abruptly revoked their legal status, which cleared them for detention by immigration agents, citing a rarely used law.\n\n\nNYTimes: State Dept.

    "text": "Inside the powerful task force spearheading Trump’s assault on colleges, DEI\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/18/antisemitism-task-force-dei-universities-trump/\n\nThe administration established the task force in February to counter what it describes as widespread failure by universities to protect Jewish students since the start of campus protests against the Israel-Gaza war. In reality, many of the task force’s unprecedented demands and punishments have nothing to do with antisemitism. Instead, they seek hiring and programming changes to strip long-standing conservative targets including DEI and a liberal worldview from higher education.\n\n\n“It’s self-evident it’s not about antisemitism,” said Yehuda Kurtzer, president of the Shalom Hartman Institute, a Jerusalem-based research and educational center focused on world Jewish life and pluralism. “Why would that have anything to do with cutting funding for research? It’s about conservative fears of higher education, and antisemitism is an excuse.”\n\n\nThe work — which at times has ignored legal norms and procedures — is driven by the task force, made up of senior officials in the Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services departments, as well as the little-known General Services Administration. Since almost the start of Trump’s second term, they have invoked both antisemitism and DEI in a quest to transform the culture of campuses and stamp out what many Republicans see as outright hostility to conservative values, discourse and thought.\n\n\nOne task force member said it makes sense to create a “global settlement” with universities that would encompass a range of alleged violations. Task force investigations sometimes start out examining allegations of antisemitism, this person said, but then identify what members see as other concerns, such as race-conscious admissions, which the Supreme Court has ruled are unconstitutional.\n\n\nTo push colleges to comply, the administration has frozen billions of dollars in federal funding to at least six highly selective universities — notably Harvard and Columbia, which have seen the highest-profile federal cuts — but also Cornell, Northwestern, Brown and Princeton.\n\n\nOne targeted school, Brown University, said its funding was cut without “any formal notification or explanation” from the federal government and “in spite of Brown’s cooperation with multiple government reviews and our compliance with the law.”\n\n\nThe public face is Leo Terrell … Terrell posts on social media throughout the day, echoing some of the right’s most incendiary and baseless claims. He also rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, often simply posting “I hate DEI” and tagging people of color with whom he disagrees as DEI hires. … He’s also echoed antisemitic comments…Multiple people said Terrell has little experience in the type of legal work the task force is undertaking and is not involved in its day-to-day legal strategy.\n\n\nMuch of the task force’s work is being shepherded by lower-profile senior administration officials: Tom Wheeler and Sean Keveney, the acting general counsels of the departments of Education and Health and Human Services, and Gruenbaum from the General Services…Harmeet Dhillon directly oversees the group’s work…Dhillon and her political team scour social media to identify instances of antisemitism and determine what investigations to launch.\n\n\nThe legal basis for the crackdown on universities centers on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in programs or activities — including universities — that receive federal funding. … Under the law, she said, “withdrawal of federal funds is treated as a last resort action.” … In several high-profile cases, the Trump task force has skipped all these steps.\n\n\nNYTimes: Fired D.E.I. Administrator Sues the University of Michigan\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/us/university-michigan-lawsuit-dei-firing-rachel-dawson.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn her lawsuit, filed on Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Ms. Dawson painted a starkly different version of events. And she said that there was racial bias in what she called the unusual process that the public university used to investigate the complaint and in its decision to side with her accusers.\n\n\n“Historically, Black women have been subjected to stereotypes that portray them as confrontational or untrustworthy,” Ms. Dawson wrote during a disciplinary review, according to her lawsuit.\n\n\nIn her lawsuit, Ms. Dawson said she was approached in March 2024 at an American Association of Colleges and Universities diversity conference by the two professors who accused the University of Michigan of fostering an antisemitic climate. Ms. Dawson’s suit says she disagreed with the women and explained the university’s efforts to combat antisemitism, including the creation of a center for that purpose. The women, the suit says, asked if she believed Palestinians had a right to live in the region of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She said she did, according to the suit. “This apparently infuriated the two women,” the lawsuit says. “They were so angry that they followed Ms. Dawson out of the room and refused to let her exit the conversation.”\n\n\n\n\nCongress Shows Resistance to Trump’s Plan to Slash Science Budgets\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/07/21/congress-shows-resistance-trumps-science-budget\n\nCongress’s proposed budgets would preserve more research spending than the president’s. It’s a rare rebuke from Republicans to the White House’s efforts to gut funding for several research support agencies.\n\n\nIn a July 10 Senate Appropriations Committee meeting, legislators put forth a cut to the National Science Foundation (NSF) of only $16 million compared to the more than $5 billion proposed by Trump. Four days later, a House Appropriations Committee subcommittee suggested slashing $2 billion—less than half of Trump’s proposal.\n\n\nHe [Roger Pielke, AEI] said the NSF, which focuses on basic research, may be more insulated from political fights than agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which deals with climate science, and the National Institutes of Health, which deals with vaccines. The congressional appropriations committees haven’t yet indicated what they plan to do with Trump’s proposed 38 percent cut to the NIH.\n\n(also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-proposed-slashing-the-national-science-foundations-budget-a-key-senate-committee-just-refused\n\nThe Senate Committee on Appropriations voted 19-10 on Thursday to keep funding for the National Science Foundation and other federal science agencies nearly intact for the 2026 fiscal year.\n\n\nFederal Grant Cuts Don’t Spare Red States, New Report Shows\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/07/23/feds-axed-grants-across-red-blue-states-report-finds\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nThe Trump administration’s cancellation of federal funds for highly selective universities in blue states has drawn national media attention. But a new report from a left-leaning think tank stresses that the federal government isn’t targeting only Harvard and Columbia’s research and innovation grants.\n\n\n“Republican- and Democrat-governed states are facing similar impacts relative to their student populations in terms of funding terminated by the administration,” says the Center for American Progress’s report, released today. And no institution is safe, CAP notes.\n\n\n“Institutions affected by grant terminations range from some of the country’s largest public universities to private research universities, small liberal arts colleges, and community colleges,” the report says. Land-grant universities and historically Black colleges and universities “have been particularly affected, with more than two-thirds of all land-grant universities and nearly half of all HBCUs targeted for funding terminations.”\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal investigations target college aid to immigrants and minorities - The Washington Post\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/23/college-scholarships-investigation-immigrants-minorities/\n\nThe inquiry will examine complaints from the conservative Equal Protection Project that the schools engaged in discrimination by allegedly showing a preference for foreign-born students. The schools named in the complaint are the University of Louisville, the University of Nebraska Omaha, the University of Miami, the University of Michigan and Western Michigan University.\n\n\nMost of the scholarships in question offer financial support for either undocumented students or those covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. Neither group is eligible to receive federal grants or loans to attend college, making institutional, state and private grants critical for their ability to access higher education.\n\n\nConservative activists and Republican state leaders have pushed colleges to abandon scholarships earmarked for underrepresented groups, arguing that the same principles underlying the Supreme Court’s ban on colleges considering an applicant’s race as a factor in admissions apply to financial aid.\n\n\nThe Equal Protection Project, led by Cornell University clinical law professor William Jacobson, has been at the forefront of that movement by filing dozens of complaints against race-conscious scholarships with the Office for Civil Rights. The group has expanded its effort by taking a look at institutional aid provided to foreign-born students.",

Under Trump, He Might Have Another Shot.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/he-helped-lead-a-disgraced-college-accreditor-under-trump-he-might-have-another-shot\n\nA decade ago, over 200 college campuses shuttered in a two-year period, leaving thousands of students in the lurch. … In 2022, the organization that accredited many of the campuses run by those companies — the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, or ACICS — was effectively shut down by the U.S. Department of Education for not responding to the concerns. The department’s withdrawal of its recognition ended a battle spanning three U.S. presidencies.\n\n\nBut in higher education as in politics, there’s often déjà vu. Anthony Bieda, a longtime ACICS executive, is back in the accreditation game at a pivotal point in the federal recalibrating of higher ed.\n\n\nBieda is hoping to help shake up the sector with what he described to The Chronicle as a holistic, AI-assisted, anti-woke approach to measuring student success through the National Association for Academic Excellence, or NAAE. He sees metrics like post-graduate earnings as limiting. Instead, the NAAE member institutions will be evaluated based on how their education influences the “formation of the human person.”\n\n\nStill, disrupting the accreditation system requires contending with a web of regulations and yearslong processes. And for Bieda’s NAAE to enter the marketplace, colleges will have to buy what it’s selling.\n\n\nThe Obama administration initially pulled recognition of ACICS in 2016; the Trump administration reinstated it in 2018 after a favorable court ruling. Then, in 2020, a USA Today investigation found that ACICS had accredited a university that was little more than an empty office, with no evidence of enrolled students or employed faculty. In 2021, the Biden administration went after ACICS again; in 2022, the Education Department rejected the accreditor’s appeal and revoked its recognition, this time for good.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump vs. Harvard: A timeline of how the fight escalated\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/2025/timeline-trump-harvard/\n\nThe Trump administration’s battle with Harvard University will be aired in court Monday, when a federal judge will hear arguments in the school’s lawsuit challenging the government’s attack on its federal research funding.\n\n\nJan. 9, 2025: Justice Department pick signals focus on Harvard\n\n\nFeb. 3: Trump administration alleges antisemitic incidents at university graduations; Trump administration announces formation of its antisemitism task force; March 8: Trump task force chair says universities have been ‘hijacked’ by leftists\n\n\nMarch 10: Trump administration investigates 60 schools for alleged antisemitism\n\n\nMarch 31: More than $8.7 billion in funding to Harvard is put under review\n\n(etc.)\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration and Harvard Face Crucial Court Test\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/us/trump-administration-harvard-hearing.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBoth Harvard and the government are asking Judge Allison D. Burroughs for summary judgment — a ruling that would decide the lawsuit, at least in Judge Burroughs’s court, without a trial.\n\n\nHarvard will argue on Monday that the Trump administration is trying to curb its First Amendment rights. Judge Burroughs sided with the university in another significant case, when she ruled on several interim matters related to the government’s effort to block the school from enrolling international students.\n\n\nThe university’s lawyers argued in a court filing last month that the government’s tactics amounted to “unconstitutional retaliation against Harvard for exercising its First Amendment rights to decide what to teach, to express certain views and to petition the courts to defend itself.”\n\n\nHarvard also said that the Trump administration’s hurried approach to cutting funding defied federal law and regulations, and its actions were “arbitrary and capricious.” The school has argued that the government’s decision to cancel funding across disciplines has little connection to the problems it wants to address, including antisemitism.\n\n*Judge Challenges Trump Administration in Hearing on Harvard Funding - The New York Times\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/us/trump-administration-harvard-hearing.html\n\nIn a courtroom in Boston on Monday, a lawyer for Harvard called the Trump administration’s case against the school “cooked up.”\n\n\nA federal judge appeared deeply skeptical on Monday of the Trump administration’s efforts to strip Harvard University of billions of dollars in research funding, suggesting the school might prevail in its legal battle against the government.\n\n\nJudge Allison D. Burroughs did not issue a ruling during a crucial hearing, which lasted more than two hours in her courtroom in Boston. But she did seem receptive to Harvard’s arguments, as both the school and the government sought to have the case decided in their favor without a trial.\n\n\n“You’re saying you can terminate a contract for any and all reasons, even if the reason you’re giving is a violation of the Constitution?” Judge Burroughs asked Mr. Velchik [team Govt] at one point, her doubts made clear by her tone. At another moment, she said, “I don’t think you can justify a contract action based on impermissible suppression of speech.”\n\n\nJudge Burroughs seemed to share the worries of Mr. Lehotsky, who said the government was pursuing an “anti-Harvard policy” that would be unlawful under any president.\n\n\n“What I’m wrestling with is this idea that the executive branch can decide what is discriminatory or racist,” she said, and then make “these ad hoc decisions without any procedure around it.”\n\n\nPresident Trump, in a social media post after the hearing, called Judge Burroughs “a TOTAL DISASTER, which I say even before hearing her Ruling.”\n\n\nHe also criticized Harvard, and reiterated promises to end its federal funds. “When she rules against us, we will IMMEDIATELY appeal, and WIN,” he wrote of Judge Burroughs. “Also, the Government will stop the practice of giving many Billions of Dollars to Harvard, much of which had been given without explanation.”\n\n(Yeah, right)\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/22/judge-appears-skeptical-harvard-funding-cuts\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/in-a-key-court-showdown-with-harvard-trump-administration-encounters-a-skeptical-judge\n(Also)\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/21/trump-harvard-hearing/\n(Also)\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-trump-court-lawsuit-analysis-6022851b?st=MuZSoj&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(But the Journal is going to Journal and has)\n\nHarvard’s odds to win its Boston court battle look favorable—but the larger war is up in the air.\n\n\nLegal analysts say Harvard has a strong case in arguing that the U.S. government improperly cut $2.2 billion in federal funding from the Ivy League school. The federal district judge presiding over a key hearing Monday appeared skeptical of the government’s arguments.\n\n\nBut President Trump is already threatening to appeal. He has many ways to inflict damage on the university meanwhile, and Harvard’s prospects—should the case end up at the Supreme Court—are less clear.\n\n\n“Harvard Creates New Public Service Program as Trump Administration Slashes Federal Jobs.”.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/us/harvard-american-service-fellowship-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nHarvard’s Kennedy School of Government announced on Thursday the creation of a new scholarship program that will fully fund master’s degrees for at least 50 students with significant experience in the public sector, including the military. The one-year program, which will enroll students in fall 2026, is intended to foster careers in public service.\n\n\nThe pilot program, called the American Service Fellowship, comes as the Trump administration is bulldozing the federal work force, including laying off many career public servants.

According to CU Apartheid Divest, disciplinary letters sent to suspended students require them to submit apologies in order to return to campus in one to three years.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://apnews.com/article/campus-protests-columbia-discipline-trump-administration-f009b90113fe0ba7847c54ffc9197bd1\n\nThe University That Chose Surrender: Columbia’s capitulation proves higher ed can’t save itself.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-university-that-chose-surrender\n\nHudson Whittaker was a Chicago blues musician who performed under the name Tampa Red. One of his finest compositions, entitled “Don’t Deal with the Devil,” opens with the following warning:\n\n\nWhen you dealin’ with the devil Everything you do is wrong You’ll drive away your lover And keep all your things in pawn… Don’t deal with the devil, cuz it ain’t no way to win.\n\n\nColumbia’s fundamental error was its failure to recognize that from the moment Max Eden of the American Enterprise Institute wrote, last December, that the Department of Education “should simply destroy Columbia University,” it was engaged not in a negotiation but in a war for survival. One would have thought that the futility of its initial capitulation — no restoration of funds followed by a series of further attacks — would have sent a clear signal, but apparently it did not.\n\n\nOne has only to read the recent “Manhattan Statement on Higher Education” — likely authored by the indefatigable Christopher Rufo and signed by an anti-woke dream team — to see that the right-wing attack on the autonomy of higher education is just getting started and that neither Columbia nor other universities will be spared further damage.\n\n\nThe Manhattan Statement is purportedly about reform, but its language — “corrupt,” “nihilism,” “tyranny,” — is the language of revolution. It is somehow unsurprising that “child sex-trait modification” manages to find its way into a description of the evils of higher education. Two hundred million dollars will not stop, will barely slow down, the ideologues at the gates.\n\nNYTimes: Columbia’s Administrators Are Fooling Themselves\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/opinion/trump-columbia-deal-professor.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn economic history, we teach the 1688 creation of parliamentary supremacy as a solution to what economists call “commitment problems.” In the absence of a third party sufficiently strong to make sure all sides stick to their promises, the powerful can renege on the powerless. The powerless, seeing this, wisely choose to not contract with the powerful. Absolutist rulers are victims of their own lack of restraints; a sovereign who is too powerful cannot get inexpensive credit, because nothing stops the ruler from defaulting on any bond. President Trump, by smashing checks on his authority, has wound up undermining his own ability to make credible deals, including the one just reached with Columbia University, where I teach.\n\n\nBut this deal is unlikely to end the attacks. The federal government, and this administration, is simply too powerful and too arbitrary to be credibly bargained with. Do we really think this arrangement, however destructive of academic autonomy it is, will prevent the Trump administration from stopping the money again? Anyone who thinks the administration will mutely walk away after the ink is dry needs to look at both the past behavior of autocratic regimes in general and this administration’s in particular.\n\n\nIt is unsurprising that a coalition of election deniers, Christian nationalists and supplement- and crypto-hawkers would have little regard for academic freedom, scientific progress and learning. It was always a stretch for Columbia to think a good-faith agreement was in the cards, but when the government is too often behaving unchecked by the law, the idea of a binding contract is a fantasy.\n\n\nColumbia University Settlement an Unprecedented Disaster | AAUP\n\nhttps://www.aaup.org/news/columbia-university-settlement-unprecedented-disaster\n\nThe Columbia University Board of Trustees’ concessions to the Trump administration are a disaster for Columbia students, faculty, and staff, as well as for academic freedom, freedom of speech, and the independence of colleges and universities nationwide. Never in the history of our nation has an educational institution so thoroughly bent to the will of an autocrat. The settlement will only fuel Trump’s authoritarian appetite to control other democratic institutions that could potentially rein him in. This settlement subverts our democracy and capitulates to the Trump plan to target the pillars of our democracy: the judiciary, the free press, and our education systems.\n\n\nAllowing the government to monitor and ultimately dictate decisions about the hiring of faculty and admission of students is a stunning breach of the independence of colleges and universities and opens the door for the ideological control this administration so eagerly craves. This is an extremely dangerous precedent that will have tremendous consequences for the sector. Trump has already reached into community colleges, public state schools, small liberal arts colleges, and minority serving institutions to limit the free expression of students and workers. The Columbia settlement will embolden the administration to further clamp down throughout higher education.\n\n\nAn authoritarian bully will not be satisfied with just one trophy at Columbia University. For higher education to function, students, staff, and faculty must be free to think and speak their minds. All who care about higher education must stand up and fight back against this unprecedented continuing assault. To preserve our democracy, we have no choice. –AAUP president Todd Wolfson\n\n\nColumbia Deal a ‘Threat’ to Higher Ed, Experts Warn\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/25/columbia-settlement-offers-warning-higher-ed\n\nColumbia’s capitulation “represents the upending of a decades-long partnership between the government and higher education in which colleges and universities nevertheless retained academic freedom, institutional autonomy and shared governance,” said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities. “It signals a rise in authoritarian populism in which higher education is positioned as the enemy in a fight against corrupt, inefficient and elite institutions that are out of touch with the needs of the working class.”\n\n\n“Whether you applaud or despise the terms of the deal, the way in which the government is operating, and getting universities like Columbia to make these deals is fundamentally coercive,” said David Pozen, a constitutional law professor at Columbia. “Therefore, it poses a significant threat to the future of higher education as well as the rule of law.”\n\n\n“The very real danger is that if elite institutions choose to submit to the authority of the Trump administration, the whole rest of the industry will follow,” said Kevin Carey, vice president of education and work at New America, a left-leaning think tank. “It will be like a stack of dominoes one falling after the other.”\n\n\nWill Creeley, legal director of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said that, in addition to admission practices, this settlement and its “blatant disregard for federal law” will upend academia’s core commitment to fostering First Amendment rights.\n\n\nMichael Thaddeus, a Columbia math professor and president of the faculty union chapter, said though administrators insist they won’t allow the government to interfere, that assurance doesn’t mean such acts won’t occur. “Students and scholars at American universities must be free to think and speak their minds,” he wrote in a statement to Inside Higher Ed. “The settlement … risks imperiling this freedom.”\n\n\nPozen, the Columbia law professor, outlined in a blog post Wednesday night how the task force bypassed nearly all statutory requirements of such an investigation. … “The means being used to push through these reforms are as unprincipled as they are unprecedented,” Pozen wrote. “Higher education policy in the United States is now being developed through ad hoc deals, a mode of regulation that is not only inimical to the ideal of the university as a site of critical thinking but also corrosive to the democratic order and to law itself.”\n\n\nKirsten Weld, a history professor and president of the Harvard faculty union chapter, said she is “very concerned” and rejects any suggestion that Columbia’s settlement should be a “blueprint” for her own institution’s negotiations.\n\n\nTed Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, also suggested via email that “this cannot be a template for the government’s approach to American higher education.” This administration “reached a conclusion before an investigation and levied a penalty without affording Columbia due process—that is chilling,” he wrote. “This administration must return to following the rule of law.”\n\n\nWhat Columbia’s Settlement Stipulates\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/executive-leadership/2025/07/24/breaking-down-columbia-us-settlement-trump-admin\n\nColumbia will see at least a partial restoration of federal research funds.\n\n\nThe agreement will close pending investigations or compliance reviews related to potential violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race or national origin. That includes a probe by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission into the treatment of Jewish employees at Columbia. Of the $221 million settlement, $21 million will go toward the EEOC complaint.\n\n\nColumbia will maintain policies announced in March that deem protests inside of academic buildings and related spaces to be a “direct impediment” to the university’s academic mission.\n\n\nThe agreement codifies changes to disciplinary processes announced in March, such as placing the University Judicial Board under the Office of the Provost who reports to the president. Students previously served on the board, but now, it will be restricted to faculty and staff members.\n\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, a frequent target of the Trump administration, are also included in the agreement. The deal bars Columbia from maintaining “programs that promote unlawful efforts to achieve race-based outcomes, quotas, diversity targets, or similar efforts.”\n\n\nThe agreement emphasizes merit-based admissions and bars Columbia from giving preference to applicants due to “race, color, or national origin.” It also prevents Columbia from using personal statements, diversity narratives or references to race “to introduce or justify discrimination.”\n\n\nMaintaining a senior vice provost to provide greater administrative oversight of Middle East studies (and other regional programs), as initially announced in March, is also part of the agreement.\n\n\nAs part of the deal, a third-party resolution monitor will police the agreement. Bart Schwartz, co-founder of Guidepost Solutions and former Chief of the Criminal Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, will serve in that role.\n\n\nThe deal also places restrictions on university hiring processes. Columbia’s agreement will bar the use of “personal statements, diversity narratives, or any applicant reference to racial identity as a means to introduce or justify discriminatory practices in hiring or promotion.” Other unspecified “indirect methods or criteria that serve as a substitute for race conscious hiring or promotion practices” are also prohibited per the deal.\n\n\nWhile some elements of the agreement are new, other parts simply codify prior changes. For example, changes to disciplinary processes, and greater administrative oversight of Middle East studies (and other regional programs) already announced in March are now codified in the deal.\n\n\n‘The Best Day Higher Ed Has Had in a Year’ – Larry Summers\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-best-day-higher-ed-has-had-in-a-year\n(Why the led with this take, who knows, I couldn’t read it.)\n\nColumbia Struck a Deal to Save Research Funding.

Gordon Institute for Urban and Minority Education at the Teachers College] biggest worry about the agreement lies in an assumption that the federal government will act in good faith. “You’re playing with an administration that has shown bad faith in relation to the rule of law, let alone even other agreements.”\n\n\nTucked Into Columbia’s Deal With Trump: A Restriction on International Enrollments\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tucked-into-columbias-deal-with-trump-a-restriction-on-international-enrollments\n\nThe requirement to study its policies for international admissions is among the terms of Columbia’s 22-page agreement with the government. The provision states that university will ask questions about why international students want to study in the United States as part of the admissions process.\n\n\nColumbia also consents to making sure that all students, international and domestic, are “committed to the longstanding traditions of American universities,” including free inquiry, open debate, and the “fundamental values” of equality and respect. It will create training materials so that students understand campus norms and values. The Trump administration has repeatedly suggested that international students have been the leaders and provocateurs behind pro-Palestinian protests that rocked Columbia and other campuses.\n\n\nWhat Columbia Just Threw Away\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-columbia-just-threw-away\n\nAnd that’s also why I’m outraged by Columbia University’s agreement yesterday with the Trump administration. There’s no other way to put it: Columbia abandoned free and open dialogue — the most fundamental principle of academic life — to save its own skin.\n\n\nBut here’s the problem: Reasonable people disagree about what kinds of statements and behaviors constitute anti-Jewish hatred. And Columbia has effectively placed that disagreement out of bounds.\n\n\nSo let’s suppose a professor declares that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, like the Nazis did in Europe. Would Columbia declare the statement antisemitic and subject the professor to disciplinary action? How about a staff member who says that “Zionism is racism”? Or a student who chants, “From the river to the sea, Palestine must be free”? You might view all of these statements as antisemitic. And depending on who is talking and listening, I might agree with you.\n\n\nBut I cannot — and will not — abide by a university that restricts our discussion of the matter.\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Walked a Tightrope on Its Way to a $200 Million Settlement With Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/25/nyregion/how-columbia-reached-a-deal.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nSo Ms. Shipman sought what she called the “seeds” of truth in matters cited by the White House, including what it perceived as an academic orthodoxy on campus or an inability to hear other voices. She and Columbia’s other leaders told themselves that they could negotiate a deal with Trump to address things on campus that they agreed were broken, so long as it didn’t cross their red lines and compromise academic freedom.\n\n\nNYTimes: Did Columbia’s Deal With Trump Save Its Stature or Sacrifice It?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/nyregion/columbia-trump-deal-reaction.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFrom the perspective of one longtime professor, a storied 270-year-old institution had capitulated to a bad-faith pressure campaign.\n\n(Then cue the both sides…and afterwards)\n\nLee C. Bollinger, the former president of Columbia, said that putting aside opinions on the university’s strategy, the Trump administration’s actions “cross several very serious, grave lines — legal, constitutional and basic norms.”\n\n\n“It’s a very sad moment. There’s no way around it,” Mr. Bollinger said, adding, “You have to come away feeling that this is really a tragedy for higher education and the country.”\n\n\nWhite House touts deal with Columbia as critics decry ‘chilling’ precedent\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/24/columbia-white-house-deal-implications-impacts/\n\nEducation lawyers and advocates said Columbia’s deal with the White House was a potentially dangerous government intrusion into higher education.\n\n\nIn agreeing to the deal, the elite Ivy League institution in New York City is entering uncharted territory: It is making an enormous payment to the federal government despite not admitting any wrongdoing while relinquishing a certain measure of oversight to an independent monitor.\n\n\nColumbia will pay a further $21 million to Jewish faculty and staff members to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Administration officials called it the largest such settlement ever for victims of antisemitism, and the largest in almost 20 years for any form of discrimination or harassment.\n\n\nThe deal that the Trump administration struck with Columbia on Wednesday is a blueprint for negotiations with other universities, a White House official said\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-columbia-trump-white-house-fines-payment-deal-settlement-d61aa9c6?st=kpHHY1&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nThe administration is in talks with several universities, including Cornell, Duke, Northwestern and Brown, the person familiar with the talks said, though it sees striking a deal with Harvard, America’s oldest university, as a key target.

Says\n\n(Yup, believe it or not)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/george-mason-president-discriminated-against-white-people-after-george-floyd-protests-justice-dept-says\n\nThe Justice Department on Thursday launched an investigation into George Mason University and its president, Gregory Washington, to determine if administrators discriminated against white male faculty and job applicants on the basis of race and sex in the aftermath of the George Floyd protests.\n\n\nIn a June 2020 email, when universities across the country were responding to the murder of George Floyd by looking for ways to address historic racial disparities on their campuses, Washington said he would make changes to the promotion and tenure processes that “recognize the invisible and uncredited emotional labor that people of color expend to learn, teach, discover, and work on campus.”\n\n\nThe department also cited a June 2022 post from Washington’s X account that celebrated DEI in the hiring process.\n\n\nNYTimes: In Virginia, the Attack on University Presidents Widens\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/us/virginia-university-presidents-dei-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nTrump administration widens probes into Virginia’s largest public university\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/22/justice-department-george-mason-investigation-dei/\n\nThe Plot to Oust the President of George Mason University – This campaign is not about policy. It’s about power.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-plot-to-oust-the-president-of-george-mason-university\n\nChristopher F. Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the mastermind behind the moral panic over “critical race theory,” has cemented his reputation as a relentless opponent of diversity, equity, and inclusion in higher education.\n\n\nHis hostility to DEI is matched by his influence among GOP decision-makers. He has organized campaigns against Claudine Gay, Harvard University’s first Black president, as well as several other Black administrators and faculty members at Harvard and other elite institutions. He helped oust Patricia Okker as president of New College of Florida and advocated for dismantling its Office of Outreach & Inclusive Excellence. Most recently, he led a successful campaign against Santa J. Ono, who was running to be the next president of the University of Florida.\n\n\nRufo’s playbook is now being used against Virginia’s public universities, with Gov. Glenn A. Youngkin, a Republican, setting the table for a federal takedown. Youngkin’s strategy has two main parts. First, he has appointed political ideologues to university governing boards and encouraged them to impose their ideology to remake higher education in Virginia. Second, alongside the attorney general, he has weakened public universities’ ability to respond to federal investigations that threaten the very mission of their institutions.\n\n\nWe recently watched this play out at the University of Virginia, where Youngkin-appointed board members and conservative alumni groups demanded the removal of all traces of DEI programs from the campus. Then came the Department of Justice investigation led by Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for the civil-rights division, and her deputy, Gregory W. Brown, both of whom are graduates of UVa. With the board unwilling to defend him and the threat that the university would lose millions of federal dollars, UVa’s president, James E. Ryan, resigned. Existential terror, indeed.\n\n\nFirst, over the past three years, George Mason has faced significant criticism from the staff of the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Education Policy, which has been led by Lindsey M. Burke for over eight years. Recently, Burke was appointed to the U.S. Department of Education. When she was chair of the George Mason board’s Academic Affairs Committee, Burke leveraged criticism from her colleagues at Heritage to justify her ongoing attacks on the university’s curriculum and its commitment to DEI.\n\n\nThe same strategy was employed to incorporate the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism into George Mason’s nondiscrimination policy without knowledge or input from faculty members. George Mason adopted this contentious definition, which critics argue conflates antisemitism with criticism of the State of Israel, under the influence of Kenneth Marcus, a former member of the university’s Board of Visitors who was appointed by Youngkin. (Marcus’s appointment has since been denied by the Democratic-controlled Virginia Legislature.) Marcus is also credited with facilitating the adoption of the IHRA definition at Harvard and Columbia. His overarching goal is to embed the IHRA definition in university discrimination policies nationwide, silencing criticism of Israel and suppressing speech in support of the Palestinian people.\n\n\nOn that same day, July 2, City Journal, a publication of the Manhattan Institute, published a column by Ian Kingsbury, a senior fellow at the Educational Freedom Institute, titled “George Mason University’s Disastrous President.” Citing a debunked Heritage-authored anti-DEI study and the Education Department’s threadbare allegations of antisemitism on campus, Kingsbury called for Washington’s ouster.\n\n\nThe interconnections among the players in this little piece of political theater boggle the mind. For example, the Heritage Foundation’s Jay P. Greene wrote the report, since debunked by George Mason administrators, on “DEI bloat” that Kingsbury cited in his City Journal hit piece. It turns out that Jay Greene was a member of Kingsbury’s doctoral committee, and they frequently collaborate on articles. Greene is also a fellow at the Education Freedom Institute, where Lindsey Burke once served as a board member. Until recently, Greene also worked for Burke at the Heritage Foundation. Around and around we go.\n\n\nOn July 3, the right-wing site Liberty Unyielding published a critique of George Mason … On July 4, National Review published a piece by George Leef, director of external affairs at the conservative James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal, referencing the Liberty Unyielding story … Based on this circular, self-referential discourse, Bacon’s Rebellion, a conservative political blog run by James A. Bacon, then posted an article predicting that George Mason could be the next university to be investigated by the Department of Justice\n\n\nAll of this is part of the strategy Rufo laid bare in an interview with Politico — publish relentless character assassination attacks in right-wing media until mainstream outlets feel they can no longer ignore the allegations, however specious or trivial.\n\n\nLet’s be clear: This campaign against George Mason and its president isn’t about antisemitism or so-called reverse racism. It’s about political control — plain and simple. … They don’t want independent thought — they seek obedience.\n\n\nThis is the Rufo doctrine in action: fabricate a crisis, flood the zone with misinformation, start coordinated media attacks, trigger federal investigations, and force institutions to collapse under the weight of bad-faith pressure. It worked at UVa. They want it to work at George Mason. If we allow it to happen again, we’re not just losing a president — we’re handing over the keys of public higher education to a political movement that views knowledge as a threat and diversity as a sin.",

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed this month, eliminates funding for SNAP-Ed, effective September 30, leaving Durgan and hundreds of researchers and educators scrambling to figure out what these cuts mean for their institutions, and the communities they serve.\n\n\nThe University of Minnesota announced July 7 that it would not renew the contracts of 59 educators who work in its extension. The federal program isn’t the extension’s only source of funds, but Durgan said she expects more layoffs as the fall approaches. “We served over 173,000 individuals last year with this program and most of it will be ending at the end of September,” Durgan said. “It just will.”\n\n\nJennifer McCaffrey, assistant dean for the family and consumer sciences programs at the University of Illinois Extension, said she expects many partner organizations to suffer because of the cuts to SNAP-Ed. In Illinois, for example, she said SNAP-Ed is the primary distributor of venison. In the most recent hunting season, it sent 25,000 pounds of the game meat to food pantries statewide, feeding nearly 50,000 families. No other organization has the capacity to carry out such a service, she said, meaning a likely increase in both food waste and hunger across the state.\n\n\nBeyond the partner organizations themselves, McCaffrey said the state’s overall nutrition and health will suffer as well. The extension used SNAP-Ed funding to carry out initiatives named in the state’s health improvement plan, she added. “So we’re unsure where we’re turning to.”\n\n\nKamaljeet Khaira, director of the University of California CalFresh Healthy Living program, said losing SNAP-Ed came as a shock given the Trump administration’s stated goal of improving Americans’ health.",

We demand that the UC name these demands as what they are: efforts to erode the strength of American higher education. Each university that falters legitimates the Trump administration’s attacks on all of our institutions of higher education and we must stand up now.

Does her training somehow give her a pass?)\n\nMs. Mailman, a 37-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer, is the most important, least-known person behind the administration’s relentless pursuit of the nation’s premier universities. The extraordinary effort has found seemingly endless ways to pressure schools into submission, including federal funding, student visas and civil rights investigations.\n\n\nThe aggressive tactics could have far-reaching implications for the future of academic freedom, the admissions practices at the most competitive colleges and the global reputations for some of the crown jewels of the nation’s university system.\n\n\nMs. Mailman wrote the executive orders Mr. Trump signed on his first day in office that redefined the federal government’s stance on sex to acknowledge only two genders and dismantled policies aimed at promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n\nShe had a direct hand in the effort to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students, which unnerved the university’s leadership and student body and which a court has temporarily halted.\n\n\n“If you normalize the use of federal power like this, then academic freedom is just a memory and universities become political footballs and no longer useful instruments in the search for truth,” said Adam Goldstein, the vice president of strategic initiatives at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free speech group.\n\n\nMs. Mailman’s work with the group [Independent Women’s Law Center], where she is returning after leaving the White House, landed her on the “hate and extremism” section of the website for GLAAD, one of the country’s leading L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy groups.\n\n\nThe Elite-University Presidents Who Despise One Another Inside the civil war between the Ivy League and the South\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/08/trump-university-presidents/683803/?gift=h1dV60W2A3Fojj_roXuAogWNo-lbRL6rAgNsbk4Qj-o&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share\n(Thanks BE!)\n\nPrinceton has largely escaped the president’s wrath, even though Eisgruber has become a leader of what you might call the academic resistance: a group of university leaders who believe that Trump’s criticisms of the sector are a pretext for eliminating academic freedom. And, in part because Eisgruber is one of the longest-serving Ivy League presidents and has a supportive board behind him, he has become vocally, if diplomatically, critical of other university presidents who he believes go too far to meet Trump’s demands.\n\n\nThose other university officials—led by Washington University’s Andrew Martin and Vanderbilt’s Daniel Diermeier, the chancellors who sparred with Eisgruber on the panel—make up the reformist camp. They accept some of Trump’s complaints and believe that the best path forward for higher education is to publicly commit to a kind of voluntary, modified de-wokeification. They argue that some campuses (in, say, Cambridge and Morningside Heights) and departments (much of the humanities) have leaned too far into leftist ideology and allowed anti-Semitism to fester under the guise of protesting Israeli policies. They want the American public to know that they are different from the Ivies. And they think that higher education needs new representation if it’s going to regain the country’s trust.\n\n\nThe divide between the reformer and resistance camps is not merely about strategy; it’s about the nature of the threat to higher education. Members of the resistance group conceive of Trump as a unique—and ultimately passing—problem: If they can survive his presidency, they’ll be safe. This seems to have led them to resist making deep, lasting changes.\n\n\nThe reformers think the resistance presidents are delusional for believing that their problems will go away when Trump does. They see the president’s attacks as symptomatic of a larger issue. Polling shows that confidence in American higher education has cratered in recent years, especially among Republicans. “The fundamental fact here is that we have never been in worse shape in my lifetime,” Diermeier told me. The reformer presidents, who tend to be in red or purple states, think the resistance leaders are trapped in liberal echo chambers. “It’s clear that the bipartisan support has eroded,” Martin told me. “It’s really misguided to think that what’s happening in higher education is a blip and that we’re going to return to where we were before.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas State U System Lets Law End Faculty Senates, for Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/11/texas-state-u-system-lets-law-end-faculty-senates-now\n\nFaculty senates across the seven Texas State University system institutions will dissolve Sept. 1, but the system’s Board of Regents plans to approve new ones, a system spokesperson says.\n\n\nUnder a new Texas law, only a public college or university’s governing board, such as the Board of Regents, can create a faculty council or senate. If a board keeps one, Senate Bill 37 further says the university president gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary” and prescribe how the senate conducts meetings.\n\n\nAlso, unless the board decides otherwise, faculty senates must shrink to no more than 60 members. Those 60 must include at least two representatives from each of the colleges and schools that comprise the university—including what the law describes vaguely as “one member appointed by the president or chief executive officer of the institution,” with the rest elected by the faculty of the particular school or college. This could mean half of a senate would be chosen by the president, barring an exemption by the board.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Freedom under attack:\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/08/12/shocking-cancellation-special-journal-issue-opinion\n(Thanks to BE for this)\n\nThe Harvard Educational Review was set to release a special issue this summer focusing on education and Palestine. The topic, commissioned in early 2024, was timely in the wake of Israel’s onslaught on Gaza, which rights groups and other experts have concluded is a genocide, and aligned with the journal’s commitment to publishing research that tackles the most pressing issues facing education. The articles had been accepted, edited and contracted. The special issue had already been promoted at major education conferences and on the back cover of the spring issue of the HER. But suddenly, Harvard pulled the plug.\n\n\nAs recently reported in The Guardian, the Harvard Education Publishing Group (HEPG), which publishes the Review, abruptly and unilaterally decided to cancel the forthcoming special issue.\n\n\n… the scrapping of this special issue marks a worrying escalation. It suggests that even those universities that are outspoken about their liberal values are ready to stifle academics’ legitimate criticism of Israeli policies and practices. Make no mistake: Anticipatory censorship of this kind is a hallmark of the governmental overreach that authoritarian regimes around the world are known for. As a growing number of higher education institutions adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism, we fear we will see more and more examples of the suppression of academic freedom.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/22/harvard-educational-review-palestine-issue-cancelled\n\n“The field of education has an important role to play in supporting students, educators, and policymakers in contextualizing what has been happening in Gaza with histories and continuing impacts of occupation, genocide, and political contestations,” the journal’s editors wrote in their call for abstracts.\n\n\nBut on 9 June, the Harvard Education Publishing Group, the journal’s publisher, abruptly canceled the release. In an email to the issue’s contributors, the publisher cited “a number of complex issues”, shocking authors and editors alike, the Guardian has learned.\n\n\n…the cancellation of an entire issue of an academic journal, which has not been previously reported, is a remarkable new development in a mounting list of examples of censorship of pro-Palestinian speech.\n\n\n“If the universities – or in this case a university press – are not willing to stand up for what is core to their mission, I don’t know what they’re doing. What’s the point?” said Thea Abu El-Haj, a Palestinian-American anthropologist of education at Barnard College, the women’s school affiliated with Columbia University, who was one of the solicited authors.\n\n\n\n\nJudge Keeps Alabama’s Anti-DEI Law in Place for Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/15/judge-keeps-alabamas-anti-dei-law-place-now\n\nRuling in part that professors lack First Amendment protections in the classroom, a federal judge denied an effort from college faculty and students in Alabama to block a 2024 state law that banned diversity, equity and inclusion programs as well as the teaching of so-called divisive concepts.\n\n\nFor instance, he ruled that the professors aren’t protected by the First Amendment because their “in-class instruction constitutes government speech.”\n\n\nFurthermore, Proctor wrote, based on other rulings in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, “when there is a dispute about what is taught in the classroom, the university’s interests outweigh those of a professor, and the professor’s interest in academic freedom and free speech do not displace the university’s interest inside the classroom.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump “Chipping Away” at DACA and Other Protections\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/08/14/trump-chipping-away-daca-and-other-protections\n\nTricia McLaughlin, assistant press secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, recently told the undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children known as Dreamers, who have for years participated in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, to self-deport.\n\n\nHer comments contradict those made by President-elect Donald Trump in a December interview with Meet the Press. He said then that he’d willingly work with Democrats on a plan to keep Dreamers in the country.\n\n\nThis conflicting rhetoric is emblematic of the tenuous position Dreamers, including thousands of college students, have occupied for years, uncertain whether past protections and legal promises will hold. Today, most of the country’s roughly 400,800 undocumented students don’t have DACA status. But the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration estimates about 119,000 are eligible for the program based on 2022 data.\n\n\nEarlier this year, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit unanimously affirmed a 2023 district court order that deemed DACA unlawful, but the judges also issued a stay, leaving the status quo unchanged for now\n\n\nPacheco said that now the government is doing a “very methodical, surgical” unwinding of Dreamers’ rights. For example, the administration revoked DACA recipients’ eligibility for Affordable Care Act health insurance. Some Dreamers with DACA status, including students, have been detained by law enforcement.\n\n\nDiego Sánchez, director of policy and strategy at the Presidents’ Alliance, said in a recent webinar that he worries the administration’s coordinated attack on DACA, and Dreamers over all, could signal a larger-scale war on the policy. He believes it’s a “very real concern right now” that the Trump administration could try to end DACA through the formal rule-making process—posting a proposed rule for public feedback, then issuing a regulation to phase out the program.\n\n\nPacheco believes higher ed institutions over all are “one of the biggest lines of defense for students.” College officials can have plans in place for potential ICE visits and insist that law enforcement show warrants if they come looking for undocumented students, she said, and the fact of being a student, if they’re detained, can elicit public sympathy. And campuses have networks of alumni who can “rally around” them.\n\n\n“One of the safest places where they can be is in a classroom, in an institution of higher learning,” Pacheco said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew executive order puts all grants under political control - Ars Technica\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/science/2025/08/new-executive-order-puts-all-grants-under-political-control/\n\nThe order also instructs agencies to formalize the ability to cancel previously awarded grants at any time if they’re considered to “no longer advance agency priorities.” Until a system is in place to enforce the new rules, agencies are forbidden from starting new funding programs.\n\n\nIn short, the new rules would mean that all federal science research would need to be approved by a political appointee who may have no expertise in the relevant areas, and the research can be canceled at any time if the political winds change. It would mark the end of a system that has enabled US scientific leadership for roughly 70 years.\n\n\nThe head of OMB, Russell Vought, has been heavily involved in trying to cut science funding, including a recent attempt to block all grants made by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\nAnother expectation? That grants will go to people who adhere to the administration’s vision of “gold standard science,” something the administration itself has abandoned when it was inconvenient.\n\n\nAn optimistic view would be that the panels of experts that evaluate grants will end up being left with the final say over funding. However, the order specifically calls on appointees not to defer to peer review. “Senior appointees and their designees shall not ministerially ratify or routinely defer to the recommendations of others in reviewing funding opportunity announcements or discretionary awards, but shall instead use their independent judgment,” it reads. “Nothing in this order shall be construed to discourage or prevent the use of peer review methods to evaluate proposals for discretionary awards or otherwise inform agency decision making, provided that peer review recommendations remain advisory and are not ministerially ratified, routinely deferred to, or otherwise treated as de facto binding by senior appointees or their designees.”\n\n(also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/08/13/trump-order-puts-politics-above-peer-review\n\nThe executive order says senior appointees must review grants, and it demands awards be easier to terminate. Research groups say it undermines science.\n\n\n\n\nNIH Guide: Weekly Index for August 15, 2025\n\nhttps://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/WeeklyIndexMobile.cfm?WeekEnding=2025-15-08\n(MP points out that the week prior had … no new funding opportunities; just a notice of early termination)\n\nGender Data Would Be Off-Limits Under Proposed NIH Policy\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/gender-data-would-be-off-limits-under-proposed-nih-policy?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=campaign_14569808_nl_Academe-Today_date_20250813\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is moving to prohibit scientists from collecting data about gender, according to a draft policy obtained by The Chronicle, as part of President Trump’s order to end federal recognition of transgender people and others who identify as a gender that doesn’t align with their sex assigned at birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Lawmakers Create Overseer to Ensure Colleges Follow Laws\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/state-oversight/2025/08/11/texas-lawmakers-create-overseer-make-colleges-follow\n\nTexas Republicans, like those in other red states in recent years, have overhauled aspects of public higher education in ways that have raised concerns about the future of academic freedom for faculty and institutional autonomy for colleges and universities. They’ve banned diversity, equity and inclusion efforts; reduced the faculty’s role in university decision-making; and mandated curriculum reviews, among other changes.\n\n\nBut Senate Bill 37, which Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law in June, added something the other states’ laws lack: It created an ombudsman position tasked with ensuring institutions follow SB 37 and the earlier DEI ban, which took effect in 2024.\n\n\n“The ombudsman shall serve as the director of compliance and monitoring,” the law says.\n\n\nFurther, students and employees can complain about violations of certain provisions of SB 37 itself. These provisions include, among others, the requirements that institutions regularly review their general ed curricula, that institutional presidents pick the presiding officers of faculty senates, that faculty elected to senates only serve two years in a row and then must take at least two years off, that only top university leaders or their designees can “be involved in decisionmaking” regarding faculty grievances and faculty discipline, and that faculty can’t have “final decisionmaking authority” on hiring other faculty or administrative leaders.\n\n\nIf the ombudsman concludes that an institution is violating such provisions, and the university doesn’t make changes that satisfy the official, the ombudsman can recommend that the Legislature bar the institution from spending state money “until the institution’s governing board certifies compliance and the state auditor confirms.”\n\n\n“The governor now has a thought police he controls,” Evans [Brian Evans, president of the Texas American Association of University Professors] added. He said the ombudsman has “the ability to compel anybody they want to be interrogated and investigated … This is really incredible power.”\n\n\nEmily Berman, vice president of the Texas AAUP-AFT’s University of Houston chapter, expects the ombudsman to “dig and dig and dig and dig—whether or not there’s anything to find there.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity College Accreditor Adopts ROI Metric\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/12/community-college-accreditor-adopts-roi-metric\n\nThe Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges is launching new tools to give members of the public more insights into student outcomes at the institutions under its purview.\n\n\nThose tools include dashboards with different student achievement data points as well as a new metric to gauge return on investment.

It must be broken down by race and sex and include students’ high school GPA, test scores, time of application (early decision, early access or regular decision) and financial aid status, among other things.\n\n\nHowever, the new survey component, which the Department of Education is calling the Admissions and Consumer Transparency Supplement, will not affect all colleges and universities—just four-year institutions that use “selective college admissions,” as they “have an elevated risk of noncompliance with the civil rights laws,” officials wrote in the notice.\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive: Harvard patents targeted by Trump administration | Reuters\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/legal/government/harvard-patents-targeted-by-trump-administration-2025-08-08/\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday ordered a comprehensive review of Harvard University’s federally funded research programs, and threatened to take title to or grant licenses from the school’s lucrative portfolio of patents.\n\n\nIn a letter to University President Alan Garber and obtained by Reuters, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick accused Harvard of breaching its legal and contractual requirements tied to the research programs and patents.\n\n\nAs of July 1, 2024, Harvard held more than 5,800 patents, opens new tab, and had more than 900 technology licenses with over 650 industry partners, according to a university website.\n\n\nTrump is not happy with the judge hearing Harvard’s lawsuits : NPR\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/08/08/nx-s1-5495486/trump-harvard-judge-lawsuits\n(Would you believe this:)\n\nShortly after Burroughs presided over a July hearing for Harvard’s lawsuit over federal funding cuts, the president took to Truth Social and called her a “Trump-hating Judge,” adding that she’s “a TOTAL DISASTER.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard and White House Move Toward Potential Landmark Settlement\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/11/us/trump-harvard-settlement-negotiations.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(I still hope this reporting by Blider, Schmidt, and Bender based on four people familiar is just spin put out by the govt. side of this shakedown)\n\nHarvard University and the Trump administration are nearing a potentially landmark legal settlement that would see Harvard agree to spend $500 million in exchange for the restoration of billions of dollars in federal research funding, according to four people familiar with the deliberations.\n\n\nBut under the framework coming together, Harvard would agree to spend $500 million on vocational and educational programs and research, three of the people said. That figure, currently penciled in to be paid out over years, would meet a demand from President Trump that Harvard spend more than double what Columbia University agreed last month to pay. It would also satisfy Harvard’s wish that it not pay the government directly, as Columbia is doing.\n\n\nHarvard would also make commitments to continue its efforts to combat antisemitism on campus, two of the people said.\n\n\nIn return, Harvard — one of the largest recipients in higher education of federal research money — would see its research funding restored and avoid the appointment of a monitor, a condition the school has demanded as a way to preserve its academic independence, according to two of the people.\n\n\nThe Trump administration would also end its widening number of investigations into the university, including ones conducted by the Justice Department and another inquiry that the Commerce Department announced on Friday. The deal would also stop attempts by the Trump administration to block Harvard from enrolling thousands of international students, according to three of the people.\n\n\nA settlement between the White House and the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university would reverberate throughout academia and could shape how other schools respond to Mr. Trump’s tactics.\n\n\nBut with the beginning of the school year approaching, negotiators have accepted that they will have to pay $500 million to strike a deal, and instead focused on how payments would be structured.\n\n\nMay Mailman, a White House adviser driving the negotiations with top universities, suggested in a recent interview that Harvard’s inclination to provide data surrounding its consideration of race in admissions would be a factor in the government’s willingness to sign off on a deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere Is Columbia’s $200-Million Settlement Going, Exactly?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/where-is-columbias-200-million-settlement-going-exactly\n(Still waiting for procurement to give access here…)\n\nCommunity College Research Collateral Damage in Columbia Fight\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/community-colleges/2025/08/13/community-college-research-collateral-damage\n\nThe Community College Research Center, an independent organization based at Columbia University’s Teachers College, found out in March that four of its grants totaling at about $12 million were immediately cancelled, despite being multiple years into their grant cycles. The remaining grant money expected from the Institute of Education Sciences amounted to at least $3.5 million. Four half-completed research projects relied on the funding. Now CCRC leaders are scrambling to find ways to continue the work.\n\n\nThe canceled grants funded two efforts focused on pandemic recovery, including a study into a program at Virginia community colleges to support adults earning short-term credentials in high-demand fields. CCRC researchers were also using IES money to evaluate the Federal Work-Study program and for a fellowship that placed doctoral students in apprenticeships at education agencies and nonprofits. Teachers College has agreed to take over funding for the fellowship program for at least the upcoming academic year.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Wants U.C.L.A. to Pay $1 Billion to Restore Its Research Funding - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/us/trump-ucla-research-funding-deal.html\n\nThe Trump administration is seeking more than $1 billion from the University of California, Los Angeles, to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research funding that the government halted, according to a draft of a settlement agreement reviewed by The New York Times.\n\n\nThe proposal calls for the university to make a $1 billion payment to the U.S. government and to contribute $172 million to a claims fund that would compensate victims of civil rights violations.\n\n\nThe University of California’s president, James B. Milliken, said in a statement on Friday that the university had “just received a document from the Department of Justice and is reviewing it.” He added, “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources, and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”\n\n\nMr. Newsom suggested the University of California would not bow to the federal government. “I will fight like hell to make sure that doesn’t happen,” said Mr. Newsom, an ex officio member of the university’s board of regents. “There’s principles. There’s right and wrong, and we’ll do the right thing, and what President Trump is doing is wrong, and everybody knows it.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/politics/ucla-trump-administration-settlement\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-08/trump-seeking-1-billion-fine-from-ucla-over-antisemitism-allegations\n\nUCLA should not bend ‘on their knees’ to Trump in grant talks, Newsom says - Los Angeles Times\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-07/newsom-ucla-trump-grant-freeze-negotiations-antisemitism\n\n‘Extortion’: Newsom Threatens to Sue After Trump Fines UCLA $1 Billion | KQED\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/news/12051521/extortion-newsom-threatens-to-sue-after-trump-fines-ucla-1-billion\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Violated Order on U.C.L.A.

Lin ordered the National Science Foundation to restore grants awarded to the university, which she said had been suspended in defiance of the court.\n\n\n“N.S.F. claims that it could simply turn around the day after the preliminary injunction” and freeze “funding on every grant that had been ordered reinstated, so long as that action was labeled as a ‘suspension’ rather than a ‘termination,’” she wrote. “This is not a reasonable interpretation.”\n\n\nJudge Lin said that the Trump administration’s freezing of university grants appeared designed more to suspend research the Trump administration has associated with liberal causes than to sincerely address concerns about racism or antisemitism.\n\n\nIn a related case focused on grants from the National Institutes of Health, a federal judge in Massachusetts described the cancellations of those grants as discriminatory toward racial and sexual minorities and driven by animus toward vulnerable groups. He similarly ordered that funding restored in an impassioned ruling from the bench in June.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/08/14/federal-judge-orders-nsf-reinstate-suspended-ucla-grants\n\n\n\n\n\nDOJ Claims George Washington U Violated Federal Civil Rights Law\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/13/doj-george-washington-u-violated-federal-civil-rights-law\n\nThe four-page letter signals that George Washington could be the next university in the Trump administration’s crosshairs.\n\n\nHarmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for the civil rights division, wrote in the letter that the department plans to enforce its findings unless the university agrees to a voluntary resolution agreement to address the agency’s concerns. She didn’t detail what such an agreement would entail or what enforcement might look like.\n\n\n\n\nUChicago Reducing, Freezing Ph.D. Admissions for Multiple Humanities Programs\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/business/academic-programs/2025/08/14/uchicago-freezing-phd-admissions-multiple-programs\n\nIn a Tuesday email that Inside Higher Ed obtained, Arts and Humanities dean Deborah Nelson told faculty, staff and Ph.D. students, “We will accept a smaller overall Ph.D. cohort across seven departments: Art History, Cinema and Media Studies, East Asian Languages and Civilizations, English Language and Literature, Linguistics, Music (composition), and Philosophy.” The university didn’t tell Inside Higher Ed how many fewer Ph.D. students would be accepted across those departments.\n\n\n“Other departments will pause admissions,” Nelson wrote.\n\n\nUChicago, which faces debt issues, has become yet another example of well-known universities freezing or scaling back Ph.D. admissions and programs amid financial pressures and other factors. In November, before Trump retook the presidency, Boston University said it was pausing accepting new Ph.D. students in a dozen humanities and social sciences programs, including philosophy, English and history. In February, the Universities of Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh announced pauses, following other institutions.\n\n\nBut UChicago’s reductions for language programs also reflect a broader trend of universities scaling back foreign language education offerings. In 2023, West Virginia University became infamous in academe for its leaders’ decision to eliminate all foreign language degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: As Trump Pushes International Students Away, Asian Schools Scoop Them Up\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/business/us-international-students-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIt’s a quandary facing many young people around the world. According to the United Nations, 6.9 million people studied outside their home country in 2022. The United States has long attracted the most foreign students, 1.1 million in the 2023-24 academic year.\n\n\nMajor international education search platforms, including IDP and Keystone Education Group, have detected a marked decline in student interest in American programs. Among academic administrators polled by the Institute of International Education this spring, more than usual reported drops in international applications for the coming year.\n\n\nThese are not the first signs that American higher education is losing its dominant position. For years, countries in Asia have been strengthening their universities and marketing them to students around the world. With more appealing alternatives, the Trump administration’s hostile stance may hasten the decline in U.S. higher education pre-eminence.\n\n\nSouth Korea’s latest target was set in 2023: 300,000 international students by 2027. For 2026, Seoul was named the top city for international students in the closely followed Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings.\n\n\nThey took guidance from a similar effort in Japan, which had about 337,000 foreign students last year and is aiming for 400,000 by 2033.\n\n\nU.S. scientists are seeing their research upended\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/14/scientists-cuts-grants-trump-research/\n\nThe reality is more troubling than headlines might suggest. Since the start of the second Trump administration, I have heard from colleagues in the medical research community about their experiences. Many are afraid to speak openly but want the public to understand the effects of these policy decisions on the future of science. I am sharing some of their stories here, while respecting their wishes to omit details that would identify them.\n\n\nA microbiologist at a major Midwestern university told me about supervising a postdoctoral researcher whose NIH funding was terminated in the spring. A court later ordered the money to be reinstated, but the postdoc has yet to receive it.\n\n\n“I am supporting her for now so that she can pay her bills and keep her health insurance,” the supervisor told me. “My postdoc is trying to hold out hope that her career can be salvaged, but it has caused an extreme amount of stress.”\n\n\nA graduate of a respected MD-PhD program and a competitive residency and research fellowship told me a similar story. They were on track to successfully launching a lab and supervising graduate students and postdocs. However, in response to diminished funding, many universities have instituted hiring freezes, and deeper cuts are expected. Some have even rescinded offers to prospective researchers. “Nobody is hiring, and who knows how long in the future this will extend?” the person said.\n\n\nIn addition, the NIH institute this scientist typically relies on for funding might vanish altogether under a proposed reorganization that would consolidate the agency’s 27 institutes and centers into just eight. “There’s so much uncertainty, it’s just devastating,” said the scientist, who is now actively applying for jobs in the private sector.\n\n\nOnly one of the scientists I talked with agreed to be named: Natoshia Cunningham, a clinical psychologist and associate professor in the department of family medicine at Michigan State University. Her husband, who was a senior scientist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, saw his research group decimated and has gone to work for a family construction business.\n\n\nCunningham describes the situation in academic research as “walking through a battlefield and there’s just all these bombs that are going off at all times all around me.” She recently learned that her study on lupus, an autoimmune condition, will not be funded next year. A colleague’s work on birth outcomes among Black mothers already has been terminated.\n\n\nEveryone I spoke with lamented the politicization of science and research. The HIV researcher, like so many other scientists, was working to improve lives. “And now ‘science’ has become a bad word,” this person said. “People talk about research as if it’s some kind of corrupt waste of money as opposed to a path forward for all of us to be healthier.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking Key Lawsuits Against the Trump Administration\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/08/12/tracking-key-lawsuits-against-trump-administration\n\nOf the 41 included in our searchable database, judges have ruled against the administration in two-thirds of the cases so far.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline Learning: Past the Tipping Point\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/tech-innovation/teaching-learning/2025/08/13/surveys-are-wake-call-colleges-improve-online-ed\n\nThis year is primed to be a pivotal one for online learning, with the number of undergraduates studying fully online surpassing that of peers studying fully in person for the first time.\n\n\nAI integration lacks strategic coordination, with few institutions represented having a unified or coordinated plan. This echoes findings from Inside Higher Ed’s 2025 Survey of Campus Chief Technology/Information Officers. Some 57 percent of chief online learning officers in the new CHLOE survey also reported that uneven access to AI tools is affecting at least some learners.\n\n\nAt same time, the report found that the online education marketplace is increasingly competitive, especially among private four-year institutions and community colleges.\n\n\n“As more institutions enter the space, differentiation and program quality are becoming strategic imperatives,” the authors wrote. (On revenue-sharing, they found models directing funds to “both academic units and central offices are best positioned to incentivize growth and sustain support infrastructure.”)\n\n\nIn a related finding, institutional investment in nondegree offerings such as certificates and microcredentials has surged, with 65 percent of respondents reporting some or major investment in these products—up from 29 percent in 2018–19. This is especially true for community colleges, where online strategies center on nondegree pathways, according to the survey.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls. The shortened wapo links are gift articles; the Chronicle links should be available through a CUNY library–BUT they currently aren’t (procurement issues). I have online access to the WSJ articles through CUNY.\nThese digests are now archived at\nhttps://cunytracker.github.io/CUNYTracker/",

Does her training somehow give her a pass?)\n\nMs. Mailman, a 37-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer, is the most important, least-known person behind the administration’s relentless pursuit of the nation’s premier universities. The extraordinary effort has found seemingly endless ways to pressure schools into submission, including federal funding, student visas and civil rights investigations.\n\n\nThe aggressive tactics could have far-reaching implications for the future of academic freedom, the admissions practices at the most competitive colleges and the global reputations for some of the crown jewels of the nation’s university system.\n\n\nMs. Mailman wrote the executive orders Mr. Trump signed on his first day in office that redefined the federal government’s stance on sex to acknowledge only two genders and dismantled policies aimed at promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n\nShe had a direct hand in the effort to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students, which unnerved the university’s leadership and student body and which a court has temporarily halted.\n\n\n“If you normalize the use of federal power like this, then academic freedom is just a memory and universities become political footballs and no longer useful instruments in the search for truth,” said Adam Goldstein, the vice president of strategic initiatives at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free speech group.\n\n\nMs. Mailman’s work with the group [Independent Women’s Law Center], where she is returning after leaving the White House, landed her on the “hate and extremism” section of the website for GLAAD, one of the country’s leading L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy groups.\n\n\nThe Elite-University Presidents Who Despise One Another Inside the civil war between the Ivy League and the South\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/08/trump-university-presidents/683803/?gift=h1dV60W2A3Fojj_roXuAogWNo-lbRL6rAgNsbk4Qj-o&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share\n(Thanks BE!)\n\nPrinceton has largely escaped the president’s wrath, even though Eisgruber has become a leader of what you might call the academic resistance: a group of university leaders who believe that Trump’s criticisms of the sector are a pretext for eliminating academic freedom. And, in part because Eisgruber is one of the longest-serving Ivy League presidents and has a supportive board behind him, he has become vocally, if diplomatically, critical of other university presidents who he believes go too far to meet Trump’s demands.\n\n\nThose other university officials—led by Washington University’s Andrew Martin and Vanderbilt’s Daniel Diermeier, the chancellors who sparred with Eisgruber on the panel—make up the reformist camp. They accept some of Trump’s complaints and believe that the best path forward for higher education is to publicly commit to a kind of voluntary, modified de-wokeification. They argue that some campuses (in, say, Cambridge and Morningside Heights) and departments (much of the humanities) have leaned too far into leftist ideology and allowed anti-Semitism to fester under the guise of protesting Israeli policies. They want the American public to know that they are different from the Ivies. And they think that higher education needs new representation if it’s going to regain the country’s trust.\n\n\nThe divide between the reformer and resistance camps is not merely about strategy; it’s about the nature of the threat to higher education. Members of the resistance group conceive of Trump as a unique—and ultimately passing—problem: If they can survive his presidency, they’ll be safe. This seems to have led them to resist making deep, lasting changes.\n\n\nThe reformers think the resistance presidents are delusional for believing that their problems will go away when Trump does. They see the president’s attacks as symptomatic of a larger issue. Polling shows that confidence in American higher education has cratered in recent years, especially among Republicans. “The fundamental fact here is that we have never been in worse shape in my lifetime,” Diermeier told me. The reformer presidents, who tend to be in red or purple states, think the resistance leaders are trapped in liberal echo chambers. “It’s clear that the bipartisan support has eroded,” Martin told me. “It’s really misguided to think that what’s happening in higher education is a blip and that we’re going to return to where we were before.”",

If a board keeps one, Senate Bill 37 further says the university president gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary” and prescribe how the senate conducts meetings.\n\n\nAlso, unless the board decides otherwise, faculty senates must shrink to no more than 60 members. Those 60 must include at least two representatives from each of the colleges and schools that comprise the university—including what the law describes vaguely as “one member appointed by the president or chief executive officer of the institution,” with the rest elected by the faculty of the particular school or college. This could mean half of a senate would be chosen by the president, barring an exemption by the board.",

    "text": "Academic Freedom under attack:\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/08/12/shocking-cancellation-special-journal-issue-opinion\n(Thanks to BE for this)\n\nThe Harvard Educational Review was set to release a special issue this summer focusing on education and Palestine. The topic, commissioned in early 2024, was timely in the wake of Israel’s onslaught on Gaza, which rights groups and other experts have concluded is a genocide, and aligned with the journal’s commitment to publishing research that tackles the most pressing issues facing education. The articles had been accepted, edited and contracted. The special issue had already been promoted at major education conferences and on the back cover of the spring issue of the HER. But suddenly, Harvard pulled the plug.\n\n\nAs recently reported in The Guardian, the Harvard Education Publishing Group (HEPG), which publishes the Review, abruptly and unilaterally decided to cancel the forthcoming special issue.\n\n\n… the scrapping of this special issue marks a worrying escalation. It suggests that even those universities that are outspoken about their liberal values are ready to stifle academics’ legitimate criticism of Israeli policies and practices. Make no mistake: Anticipatory censorship of this kind is a hallmark of the governmental overreach that authoritarian regimes around the world are known for. As a growing number of higher education institutions adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism, we fear we will see more and more examples of the suppression of academic freedom.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/22/harvard-educational-review-palestine-issue-cancelled\n\n“The field of education has an important role to play in supporting students, educators, and policymakers in contextualizing what has been happening in Gaza with histories and continuing impacts of occupation, genocide, and political contestations,” the journal’s editors wrote in their call for abstracts.\n\n\nBut on 9 June, the Harvard Education Publishing Group, the journal’s publisher, abruptly canceled the release. In an email to the issue’s contributors, the publisher cited “a number of complex issues”, shocking authors and editors alike, the Guardian has learned.\n\n\n…the cancellation of an entire issue of an academic journal, which has not been previously reported, is a remarkable new development in a mounting list of examples of censorship of pro-Palestinian speech.\n\n\n“If the universities – or in this case a university press – are not willing to stand up for what is core to their mission, I don’t know what they’re doing. What’s the point?” said Thea Abu El-Haj, a Palestinian-American anthropologist of education at Barnard College, the women’s school affiliated with Columbia University, who was one of the solicited authors.\n\n\n\n\nJudge Keeps Alabama’s Anti-DEI Law in Place for Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/15/judge-keeps-alabamas-anti-dei-law-place-now\n\nRuling in part that professors lack First Amendment protections in the classroom, a federal judge denied an effort from college faculty and students in Alabama to block a 2024 state law that banned diversity, equity and inclusion programs as well as the teaching of so-called divisive concepts.\n\n\nFor instance, he ruled that the professors aren’t protected by the First Amendment because their “in-class instruction constitutes government speech.”\n\n\nFurthermore, Proctor wrote, based on other rulings in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, “when there is a dispute about what is taught in the classroom, the university’s interests outweigh those of a professor, and the professor’s interest in academic freedom and free speech do not displace the university’s interest inside the classroom.”",

He said then that he’d willingly work with Democrats on a plan to keep Dreamers in the country.\n\n\nThis conflicting rhetoric is emblematic of the tenuous position Dreamers, including thousands of college students, have occupied for years, uncertain whether past protections and legal promises will hold. Today, most of the country’s roughly 400,800 undocumented students don’t have DACA status. But the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration estimates about 119,000 are eligible for the program based on 2022 data.\n\n\nEarlier this year, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit unanimously affirmed a 2023 district court order that deemed DACA unlawful, but the judges also issued a stay, leaving the status quo unchanged for now\n\n\nPacheco said that now the government is doing a “very methodical, surgical” unwinding of Dreamers’ rights. For example, the administration revoked DACA recipients’ eligibility for Affordable Care Act health insurance. Some Dreamers with DACA status, including students, have been detained by law enforcement.\n\n\nDiego Sánchez, director of policy and strategy at the Presidents’ Alliance, said in a recent webinar that he worries the administration’s coordinated attack on DACA, and Dreamers over all, could signal a larger-scale war on the policy. He believes it’s a “very real concern right now” that the Trump administration could try to end DACA through the formal rule-making process—posting a proposed rule for public feedback, then issuing a regulation to phase out the program.\n\n\nPacheco believes higher ed institutions over all are “one of the biggest lines of defense for students.” College officials can have plans in place for potential ICE visits and insist that law enforcement show warrants if they come looking for undocumented students, she said, and the fact of being a student, if they’re detained, can elicit public sympathy. And campuses have networks of alumni who can “rally around” them.\n\n\n“One of the safest places where they can be is in a classroom, in an institution of higher learning,” Pacheco said.",

It would mark the end of a system that has enabled US scientific leadership for roughly 70 years.\n\n\nThe head of OMB, Russell Vought, has been heavily involved in trying to cut science funding, including a recent attempt to block all grants made by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\nAnother expectation? That grants will go to people who adhere to the administration’s vision of “gold standard science,” something the administration itself has abandoned when it was inconvenient.\n\n\nAn optimistic view would be that the panels of experts that evaluate grants will end up being left with the final say over funding. However, the order specifically calls on appointees not to defer to peer review. “Senior appointees and their designees shall not ministerially ratify or routinely defer to the recommendations of others in reviewing funding opportunity announcements or discretionary awards, but shall instead use their independent judgment,” it reads. “Nothing in this order shall be construed to discourage or prevent the use of peer review methods to evaluate proposals for discretionary awards or otherwise inform agency decision making, provided that peer review recommendations remain advisory and are not ministerially ratified, routinely deferred to, or otherwise treated as de facto binding by senior appointees or their designees.”\n\n(also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/08/13/trump-order-puts-politics-above-peer-review\n\nThe executive order says senior appointees must review grants, and it demands awards be easier to terminate.

They’ve banned diversity, equity and inclusion efforts; reduced the faculty’s role in university decision-making; and mandated curriculum reviews, among other changes.\n\n\nBut Senate Bill 37, which Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law in June, added something the other states’ laws lack: It created an ombudsman position tasked with ensuring institutions follow SB 37 and the earlier DEI ban, which took effect in 2024.\n\n\n“The ombudsman shall serve as the director of compliance and monitoring,” the law says.\n\n\nFurther, students and employees can complain about violations of certain provisions of SB 37 itself. These provisions include, among others, the requirements that institutions regularly review their general ed curricula, that institutional presidents pick the presiding officers of faculty senates, that faculty elected to senates only serve two years in a row and then must take at least two years off, that only top university leaders or their designees can “be involved in decisionmaking” regarding faculty grievances and faculty discipline, and that faculty can’t have “final decisionmaking authority” on hiring other faculty or administrative leaders.\n\n\nIf the ombudsman concludes that an institution is violating such provisions, and the university doesn’t make changes that satisfy the official, the ombudsman can recommend that the Legislature bar the institution from spending state money “until the institution’s governing board certifies compliance and the state auditor confirms.”\n\n\n“The governor now has a thought police he controls,” Evans [Brian Evans, president of the Texas American Association of University Professors] added. He said the ombudsman has “the ability to compel anybody they want to be interrogated and investigated … This is really incredible power.”\n\n\nEmily Berman, vice president of the Texas AAUP-AFT’s University of Houston chapter, expects the ombudsman to “dig and dig and dig and dig—whether or not there’s anything to find there.”",

Like the Western Association of Schools and Colleges Senior College and University Commission, ACCJC is planning to measure ROI using price–to–earnings premium. Developed in part by Third Way and the College Futures Foundation, the earnings premium tracks how long it takes for graduates from different programs to recover educational costs.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Escalates a Fight Over How to Measure Merit in American Education\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/us/trump-merit-affirmative-action-colleges.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nColleges will face even more intense scrutiny over their admissions practices as the administration pushes them to rely more heavily on quantitative measures, which experts say could result in wealthier, less diverse student populations at elite universities.\n\n\nUnder the new order, the information will be reported publicly in a federal database called the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, or IPEDS.\n\n\nDept. of Ed Clarifies What Race-Based Data Must Be Reported\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/14/dept-ed-clarifies-what-race-based-data-must-be-reported\n\nA draft of the proposal, which will officially be published Friday on the Federal Register, states that certain institutions will be required to collect and report comprehensive data about their admissions decisions going back five years. It must be broken down by race and sex and include students’ high school GPA, test scores, time of application (early decision, early access or regular decision) and financial aid status, among other things.\n\n\nHowever, the new survey component, which the Department of Education is calling the Admissions and Consumer Transparency Supplement, will not affect all colleges and universities—just four-year institutions that use “selective college admissions,” as they “have an elevated risk of noncompliance with the civil rights laws,” officials wrote in the notice.\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive: Harvard patents targeted by Trump administration | Reuters\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/legal/government/harvard-patents-targeted-by-trump-administration-2025-08-08/\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday ordered a comprehensive review of Harvard University’s federally funded research programs, and threatened to take title to or grant licenses from the school’s lucrative portfolio of patents.\n\n\nIn a letter to University President Alan Garber and obtained by Reuters, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick accused Harvard of breaching its legal and contractual requirements tied to the research programs and patents.\n\n\nAs of July 1, 2024, Harvard held more than 5,800 patents, opens new tab, and had more than 900 technology licenses with over 650 industry partners, according to a university website.\n\n\nTrump is not happy with the judge hearing Harvard’s lawsuits : NPR\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/08/08/nx-s1-5495486/trump-harvard-judge-lawsuits\n(Would you believe this:)\n\nShortly after Burroughs presided over a July hearing for Harvard’s lawsuit over federal funding cuts, the president took to Truth Social and called her a “Trump-hating Judge,” adding that she’s “a TOTAL DISASTER.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard and White House Move Toward Potential Landmark Settlement\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/11/us/trump-harvard-settlement-negotiations.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(I still hope this reporting by Blider, Schmidt, and Bender based on four people familiar is just spin put out by the govt. side of this shakedown)\n\nHarvard University and the Trump administration are nearing a potentially landmark legal settlement that would see Harvard agree to spend $500 million in exchange for the restoration of billions of dollars in federal research funding, according to four people familiar with the deliberations.\n\n\nBut under the framework coming together, Harvard would agree to spend $500 million on vocational and educational programs and research, three of the people said. That figure, currently penciled in to be paid out over years, would meet a demand from President Trump that Harvard spend more than double what Columbia University agreed last month to pay. It would also satisfy Harvard’s wish that it not pay the government directly, as Columbia is doing.\n\n\nHarvard would also make commitments to continue its efforts to combat antisemitism on campus, two of the people said.\n\n\nIn return, Harvard — one of the largest recipients in higher education of federal research money — would see its research funding restored and avoid the appointment of a monitor, a condition the school has demanded as a way to preserve its academic independence, according to two of the people.\n\n\nThe Trump administration would also end its widening number of investigations into the university, including ones conducted by the Justice Department and another inquiry that the Commerce Department announced on Friday. The deal would also stop attempts by the Trump administration to block Harvard from enrolling thousands of international students, according to three of the people.\n\n\nA settlement between the White House and the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university would reverberate throughout academia and could shape how other schools respond to Mr. Trump’s tactics.\n\n\nBut with the beginning of the school year approaching, negotiators have accepted that they will have to pay $500 million to strike a deal, and instead focused on how payments would be structured.\n\n\nMay Mailman, a White House adviser driving the negotiations with top universities, suggested in a recent interview that Harvard’s inclination to provide data surrounding its consideration of race in admissions would be a factor in the government’s willingness to sign off on a deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere Is Columbia’s $200-Million Settlement Going, Exactly?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/where-is-columbias-200-million-settlement-going-exactly\n(Still waiting for procurement to give access here…)\n\nCommunity College Research Collateral Damage in Columbia Fight\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/community-colleges/2025/08/13/community-college-research-collateral-damage\n\nThe Community College Research Center, an independent organization based at Columbia University’s Teachers College, found out in March that four of its grants totaling at about $12 million were immediately cancelled, despite being multiple years into their grant cycles. The remaining grant money expected from the Institute of Education Sciences amounted to at least $3.5 million. Four half-completed research projects relied on the funding. Now CCRC leaders are scrambling to find ways to continue the work.\n\n\nThe canceled grants funded two efforts focused on pandemic recovery, including a study into a program at Virginia community colleges to support adults earning short-term credentials in high-demand fields. CCRC researchers were also using IES money to evaluate the Federal Work-Study program and for a fellowship that placed doctoral students in apprenticeships at education agencies and nonprofits. Teachers College has agreed to take over funding for the fellowship program for at least the upcoming academic year.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Wants U.C.L.A. to Pay $1 Billion to Restore Its Research Funding - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/us/trump-ucla-research-funding-deal.html\n\nThe Trump administration is seeking more than $1 billion from the University of California, Los Angeles, to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research funding that the government halted, according to a draft of a settlement agreement reviewed by The New York Times.\n\n\nThe proposal calls for the university to make a $1 billion payment to the U.S. government and to contribute $172 million to a claims fund that would compensate victims of civil rights violations.\n\n\nThe University of California’s president, James B. Milliken, said in a statement on Friday that the university had “just received a document from the Department of Justice and is reviewing it.” He added, “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources, and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”\n\n\nMr. Newsom suggested the University of California would not bow to the federal government. “I will fight like hell to make sure that doesn’t happen,” said Mr. Newsom, an ex officio member of the university’s board of regents. “There’s principles. There’s right and wrong, and we’ll do the right thing, and what President Trump is doing is wrong, and everybody knows it.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/politics/ucla-trump-administration-settlement\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-08/trump-seeking-1-billion-fine-from-ucla-over-antisemitism-allegations\n\nUCLA should not bend ‘on their knees’ to Trump in grant talks, Newsom says - Los Angeles Times\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-07/newsom-ucla-trump-grant-freeze-negotiations-antisemitism\n\n‘Extortion’: Newsom Threatens to Sue After Trump Fines UCLA $1 Billion | KQED\n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/news/12051521/extortion-newsom-threatens-to-sue-after-trump-fines-ucla-1-billion\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Violated Order on U.C.L.A. Grant Terminations, Judge Says\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/12/us/politics/ucla-grant-nsf-science-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nJudge Rita F. Lin ordered the National Science Foundation to restore grants awarded to the university, which she said had been suspended in defiance of the court.\n\n\n“N.S.F. claims that it could simply turn around the day after the preliminary injunction” and freeze “funding on every grant that had been ordered reinstated, so long as that action was labeled as a ‘suspension’ rather than a ‘termination,’” she wrote. “This is not a reasonable interpretation.”\n\n\nJudge Lin said that the Trump administration’s freezing of university grants appeared designed more to suspend research the Trump administration has associated with liberal causes than to sincerely address concerns about racism or antisemitism.\n\n\nIn a related case focused on grants from the National Institutes of Health, a federal judge in Massachusetts described the cancellations of those grants as discriminatory toward racial and sexual minorities and driven by animus toward vulnerable groups. He similarly ordered that funding restored in an impassioned ruling from the bench in June.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/08/14/federal-judge-orders-nsf-reinstate-suspended-ucla-grants",

She didn’t detail what such an agreement would entail or what enforcement might look like.\n\n\n\n\nUChicago Reducing, Freezing Ph.D. Admissions for Multiple Humanities Programs\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/business/academic-programs/2025/08/14/uchicago-freezing-phd-admissions-multiple-programs\n\nIn a Tuesday email that Inside Higher Ed obtained, Arts and Humanities dean Deborah Nelson told faculty, staff and Ph.D. students, “We will accept a smaller overall Ph.D. cohort across seven departments: Art History, Cinema and Media Studies, East Asian Languages and Civilizations, English Language and Literature, Linguistics, Music (composition), and Philosophy.” The university didn’t tell Inside Higher Ed how many fewer Ph.D. students would be accepted across those departments.\n\n\n“Other departments will pause admissions,” Nelson wrote.\n\n\nUChicago, which faces debt issues, has become yet another example of well-known universities freezing or scaling back Ph.D. admissions and programs amid financial pressures and other factors. In November, before Trump retook the presidency, Boston University said it was pausing accepting new Ph.D. students in a dozen humanities and social sciences programs, including philosophy, English and history. In February, the Universities of Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh announced pauses, following other institutions.\n\n\nBut UChicago’s reductions for language programs also reflect a broader trend of universities scaling back foreign language education offerings.

According to the United Nations, 6.9 million people studied outside their home country in 2022. The United States has long attracted the most foreign students, 1.1 million in the 2023-24 academic year.\n\n\nMajor international education search platforms, including IDP and Keystone Education Group, have detected a marked decline in student interest in American programs. Among academic administrators polled by the Institute of International Education this spring, more than usual reported drops in international applications for the coming year.\n\n\nThese are not the first signs that American higher education is losing its dominant position. For years, countries in Asia have been strengthening their universities and marketing them to students around the world. With more appealing alternatives, the Trump administration’s hostile stance may hasten the decline in U.S. higher education pre-eminence.\n\n\nSouth Korea’s latest target was set in 2023: 300,000 international students by 2027. For 2026, Seoul was named the top city for international students in the closely followed Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings.\n\n\nThey took guidance from a similar effort in Japan, which had about 337,000 foreign students last year and is aiming for 400,000 by 2033.\n\n\nU.S. scientists are seeing their research upended\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/14/scientists-cuts-grants-trump-research/\n\nThe reality is more troubling than headlines might suggest. Since the start of the second Trump administration, I have heard from colleagues in the medical research community about their experiences. Many are afraid to speak openly but want the public to understand the effects of these policy decisions on the future of science. I am sharing some of their stories here, while respecting their wishes to omit details that would identify them.\n\n\nA microbiologist at a major Midwestern university told me about supervising a postdoctoral researcher whose NIH funding was terminated in the spring. A court later ordered the money to be reinstated, but the postdoc has yet to receive it.\n\n\n“I am supporting her for now so that she can pay her bills and keep her health insurance,” the supervisor told me. “My postdoc is trying to hold out hope that her career can be salvaged, but it has caused an extreme amount of stress.”\n\n\nA graduate of a respected MD-PhD program and a competitive residency and research fellowship told me a similar story. They were on track to successfully launching a lab and supervising graduate students and postdocs. However, in response to diminished funding, many universities have instituted hiring freezes, and deeper cuts are expected. Some have even rescinded offers to prospective researchers. “Nobody is hiring, and who knows how long in the future this will extend?” the person said.\n\n\nIn addition, the NIH institute this scientist typically relies on for funding might vanish altogether under a proposed reorganization that would consolidate the agency’s 27 institutes and centers into just eight. “There’s so much uncertainty, it’s just devastating,” said the scientist, who is now actively applying for jobs in the private sector.\n\n\nOnly one of the scientists I talked with agreed to be named: Natoshia Cunningham, a clinical psychologist and associate professor in the department of family medicine at Michigan State University. Her husband, who was a senior scientist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, saw his research group decimated and has gone to work for a family construction business.\n\n\nCunningham describes the situation in academic research as “walking through a battlefield and there’s just all these bombs that are going off at all times all around me.” She recently learned that her study on lupus, an autoimmune condition, will not be funded next year. A colleague’s work on birth outcomes among Black mothers already has been terminated.\n\n\nEveryone I spoke with lamented the politicization of science and research. The HIV researcher, like so many other scientists, was working to improve lives. “And now ‘science’ has become a bad word,” this person said. “People talk about research as if it’s some kind of corrupt waste of money as opposed to a path forward for all of us to be healthier.”",

This echoes findings from Inside Higher Ed’s 2025 Survey of Campus Chief Technology/Information Officers. Some 57 percent of chief online learning officers in the new CHLOE survey also reported that uneven access to AI tools is affecting at least some learners.\n\n\nAt same time, the report found that the online education marketplace is increasingly competitive, especially among private four-year institutions and community colleges.\n\n\n“As more institutions enter the space, differentiation and program quality are becoming strategic imperatives,” the authors wrote. (On revenue-sharing, they found models directing funds to “both academic units and central offices are best positioned to incentivize growth and sustain support infrastructure.”)\n\n\nIn a related finding, institutional investment in nondegree offerings such as certificates and microcredentials has surged, with 65 percent of respondents reporting some or major investment in these products—up from 29 percent in 2018–19.

The end game is clear: Charter schools, religious schools and private schools will benefit from a much greater share of public education dollars with less accountability.

    "text": "Dear All,\nPlease find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.\nThanks to BE and KB, for contributions this week.\n\n\n\nMADCs Tracker (U Mass Amherst)\n\nhttps://www.umass.edu/senate/madcs-tracker\n(Lots of CUNY campuses noted herein)\n\n\n\n\nOne military ethics professor has resigned from teaching in protest, telling @RadioFreeTom that staying would have been both morally and practically untenable after chilling orders from Donald Trump and Pete Hegseth went into effect.\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/06/academic-freedom-naval-war-college/683309/?gift=h1dV60W2A3Fojj_roXuAolYWcUkZgtqTyh3LGmPuw9Y\n(Thanks BE)\n\n\n\n\nMore Americans Trust Public Universities Than Private Ones\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/23/more-americans-trust-public-universities-private-ones\n(Thanks BE)\n\nWhile nearly half of respondents (46 percent) indicated they have “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in public institutions, only 30 percent reported the same for private institutions. Despite the public’s declining confidence in institutions of higher education, 76 percent of Americans think a college education is very or somewhat important for success. Ninety percent of Democrats, 71 percent of Republicans and 72 percent of Independents agree that a college education is at least somewhat important.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Republican Plot to Un-Educate America | The New Republic\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/197017/budget-bill-kill-higher-education\n\nTrump’s “big, beautiful bill” is an extinction-level event for higher education that would annihilate the country’s intellectual potential.\n\n\nFor colleges and universities, the potential fallout is hard to overstate. Whatever schools survive are likely to be drained of working- and middle-class families, instead populated only by society’s most wealthy. As it is, millions of people rightly consider universities to be a costly endeavor that is irrelevant to their everyday life. But rather than remaking higher ed into a vibrant and more democratic institution, this bill threatens to do the opposite. It will cement the stereotype of higher education as an elite institution into an ironclad reality. On June 25, student debtors and their allies will be protesting these devastating cuts in Washington, D.C. But so far, very few elected officials are sounding the alarm on these issues with the fever pitch they deserve, let alone doing the work required to slow down and obstruct their passage into law.\n\n\nIn the words of influential conservative activist Christopher Rufo, “Reforming the student loan programs could put the whole university sector into a significant recession” and state of “existential terror.” The goal is to use economic policy to impose an unpopular and stifling ideological agenda, exacted by punitive student debt.\n\n\nThese cuts won’t just harm students who rely on loans to afford college; they will take the doors off colleges’ and universities’ capacity to expand minds and redistribute opportunity. Lost revenue will encourage schools to close programs, squeeze staff, and perhaps shutter entirely. A proposed endowment tax for colleges and universities has prompted fury among higher education lobbyists, but those players have said very little about the bill’s vigorous imposition of debt as a tool of social control.\n\n\nContemporary Republicans are even more brazen. Consider a recent report released by the Heritage Foundation that recommends terminating higher education “subsidies” and student loan cancellation in order to “increase the married birthrate.” What does this goulash mean in plain English?\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Freedom Was Already Limited at U.S. Service Academies. Then Came Trump.\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/06/23/academic-freedom-service-academies-dissipates-under\n(Thanks BE for sharing)\n\nOfficials are restricting education about diversity and criticism of the U.S. It’s an erosion of rights within the institutions training America’s future military officers.\n\n\nA week into his second presidential term, Donald Trump issued an executive order banning service academies under the Defense Department—the U.S Military Academy at West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Air Force Academy—from “promoting, advancing, or otherwise inculcating the following un-American, divisive, discriminatory, radical, extremist, and irrational theories.” The theories listed were “divisive concepts,” “gender ideology,” race or sex “stereotyping” and “scapegoating,” and the idea “that America’s founding documents are racist or sexist.”\n\n\nThe Times also reported that Christopher Barth, West Point’s senior librarian, is resigning after 14 years amid demands that he identify books that might violate Hegseth’s order. West Point didn’t answer most questions that Inside Higher Ed posed to it, including whether books have actually been removed.\n\n\nAt the Naval Academy, Tom McCarthy resigned from his role as history department chair this month, The Baltimore Sun reported. The Naval Academy confirmed his resignation letter to Inside Higher Ed.\n\n\n‘A Banner Year for Censorship’: More States Are Restricting Classroom Discussions on Race and Gender\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-banner-year-for-censorship-more-states-are-restricting-classroom-discussions-on-race-and-gender\n\nTeaching social work in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Cassandra E. Simon often assigns readings that describe how the families her students might one day serve have been impacted by more than a century of housing, employment, and education discrimination. The associate professor has encouraged her students to engage in spirited discussions about race, even assigning a project in which they advocate for or against a social-justice issue.\n\n\nDoing any of those things today, she argues in a federal lawsuit, could get her fired from the state flagship, where she’s taught for 25 years. Last year, the state’s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, signed into law a sweeping bill that restricts what professors can teach about race. If any of their lessons veer into what conservative politicians have deemed “divisive concepts,” faculty members risk being reported, investigated, and potentially fired.\n\n\nBut over the past two years, more than a dozen laws have been enacted that either limit which classes can be taught or imposed restrictions on what professors can say in the classroom, according to a Chronicle analysis of state legislation and a compilation of what PEN America calls “educational gag orders.”\n\n\nThis year especially “has been a banner year for censorship at a state level across the country,” said Amy B. Reid, senior manager at PEN America’s Freedom to Learn program. “The point of a lot of these restrictions is to put people on guard, worried that anything or everything could be prohibited so you really have to watch what you say.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas looks to enact restrictions on when and how students can protest\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/20/texas-campus-speech-law-palestine-protests/\n\nSenate Bill 2972 prohibits protesting between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m., or during the last two weeks of the semester; and bans students from camping or erecting tents on campus, or wearing a disguise to conceal their identity. It also bars the use of microphones and drums.\n\n\nRepublicans in Texas say the proposal will prevent campus disruption and intimidation seen during last year’s pro-Palestinian protests. But critics across the political spectrum, such as the free speech advocacy group Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, say the proposal is too broad and threatens all forms of expressive activity.\n\n\n“Wearing a MAGA hat or a Bernie [Sanders] T-shirt would be prohibited between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. because the political apparel is an expressive act, and therefore covered as an expressive activity,” said Tyler Coward, FIRE’s lead counsel for government affairs.\n\n\nUnder the proposed law, universities could bar a guest speaker from campus if school officials believe there will be a large protest, Coward said.\n\n\nTexas Governor Signs Bill to Limit Expressive Activity on Campuses\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/free-speech/2025/06/23/texas-passes-bill-limiting-expressive-activity-campus\n\nTexas governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial bill that would restrict expressive activities on college campuses, reversing some of the rights afforded by a 2019 bill intended to protect Texans’ ability to protest on campuses.\n\n\nTexas Governor Signs Law Giving Presidents Control of Faculty Senates\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/24/texas-passes-law-presidents-control-faculty-senates\n(These were highlighted in an earlier digest, but worth repeating…)\n\nSenate Bill 37 says that only an institution’s governing board can create a faculty council or senate. If a board decides to keep one, the college or university president gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary” and prescribe how the body conducts meetings.\n\n\nUnless the institution’s board decides otherwise, faculty governing bodies must shrink to no more than 60 members. The Texas A&M University Faculty Senate currently has 122.\n\n\nThe 60 members must include at least two representatives from each of the colleges and schools that comprise the institution—including what the law describes vaguely as “one member appointed by the president or chief executive officer of the institution,” with the rest elected by the faculty of the particular school or college. This could mean that half of a faculty senate would be chosen by the president, barring an exemption by the institution’s board.\n\n\nSB 37 also says an institution’s provost can recommend to the president that members be “immediately removed” for failing to attend meetings or not conducting their “responsibilities within the council’s or senate’s parameters,” or for “similar misconduct.”\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Says He Wants to Fund More Trade Schools. Just Not These.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/21/business/job-corps-trump-trade-schools.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n“The program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve,” Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement announcing the shutdown.\n\n\nThe abrupt decision reignited a longstanding debate over the program’s merits and effectiveness. It also created a new point of contention in President Trump’s efforts to cut costs by dismantling elements of the social safety net. As Congress debates a budget bill that would reduce funding for federal anti-poverty programs such as Medicaid and food benefits, the White House is also proposing that the Job Corps, with its nearly $1.8 billion budget, be eliminated.\n\n\nTrump DEI Purge Made Black Women in Federal Jobs an “Easy Target” — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/trump-dei-black-women-minorities-careers-jobs-dismissed\n\nHer experience is part of a largely untold story unfolding as Trump dismantles civil rights and inclusion programs across government: Many of those being forced out, like Crowner, are Black women who spent decades building a career of government service, only to see those careers shattered in a sudden purge.\n\n\nNYTimes: How Trump Treats Black History Differently Than Other Parts of America’s Past\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/politics/trump-black-history-federal-holidays.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nChad Williams, a historian and professor of African American and Black diaspora studies at Boston University, said Mr. Trump’s actions, taken as a whole, showed that the administration was seeking to craft a “propaganda version of history.”\n\n\n“They’re trying to erase the history of Black struggle and Black resistance by denying the realities of racism and white supremacy,” Mr. Williams said. “They’re crafting a history that romanticizes the past at the expense of a true telling of the complexities and nuances of the American experience.”\n\n\nHBCUs Reel as Trump Cuts Black-Focused Grants: ‘This Is Our Existence’\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/hbcus-reel-as-trump-cuts-black-focused-grants-this-is-our-existence\n\nIn less than three years, Quick [Tennessee State University’s Quincy Quick] helped raise $100 million in research grants, launch an AI research center, and bring Tennessee State significantly closer to becoming the second historically Black college and university to receive Research I status. But many of those grants focused on serving Black students and Black communities, a core part of the land-grant institution’s mission.\n\n\nAs the VPs fretted over how they would retain vital research grants, one administrator quipped, “HBCUs won’t be affected because they don’t look at HBCUs as DEI.”\n\n\nQuick, the only HBCU administrator in attendance, recalled thinking, “That’s ridiculous, and it’s absolutely naïve. We absolutely would get hit. … And that’s exactly what has happened.”\n\n\nIn total, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation have canceled more than $140 million in grants at HBCUs since March, according to a Chronicle analysis of two databases tracking grant cancellations.\n\n\nThe NIH in March said that plans to enhance diversity are no longer required in training-grant applications, and “those included in applications under review will not be evaluated or considered in funding decisions.”\n\n\nThe NSF said in April that research supported by the federal government must “aim to create opportunities for all Americans everywhere.” Federally supported research on protected groups must be open to all nonprotected groups.\n\n\nThe agency has not provided guidance on what initiatives are considered DEI.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Justice Dept. Pressuring University of Virginia President to Resign\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/us/politics/university-of-virginia-president-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration has privately demanded that the University of Virginia oust its president to help resolve a Justice Department investigation into the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, according to three people briefed on the matter.\n\n\nThe extraordinary condition the Justice Department has put on the school demonstrates that President Trump’s bid to shift the ideological tilt of the higher education system, which he views as hostile to conservatives, is more far-reaching than previously understood.\n\n\nJustice Department officials have told University of Virginia officials that hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding are at risk because of what the department says is the school’s disregard for civil rights law over its diversity practices, according to two of the people.\n\n\nThe demand to remove Mr. Ryan was made over the past month on several occasions by Gregory Brown, the deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights\n\n\nHarmeet K. Dhillon, the Justice Department’s top civil rights lawyer, has also been involved in negotiations with the university.\n\n\nBefore becoming the University of Virginia’s president, Mr. Ryan served as the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he was praised for his commitment to D.E.I. programs.\n\n\nThe administration’s attempt to assert federal influence over state university leadership decisions is also illustrative of how Mr. Trump’s political appointees continue to wield the Justice Department’s investigative powers to achieve policy goals long sought by a top Trump adviser, Stephen Miller.\n\n\nBut Mr. Ryan has been singled out by the Trump administration as his steps toward compliance have been criticized by conservative groups as insufficient. America First Legal, a nonprofit started by Mr. Miller, last month accused the University of Virginia of paying lip service to Mr. Trump’s orders by simply running the same diversity programs under a different name. The group issued a news release last month that called on the Justice Department to “hold UVA accountable.”\n\n(also here)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda\n\nNYTimes: How Trump Upended 60 Years of Civil Rights in Two Months\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/27/magazine/trump-civil-rights-law-discrimination.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast year, a little-known office in the U.S. Department of Labor helped Black workers at a Texas medical center recover $900,000 in back wages, and Black workers at a Caterpillar manufacturing plant in Illinois recover $800,000, each time over allegations that those applicants lost out on jobs because of their race. Called the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, this division investigates and fights employment discrimination for one-fifth of the U.S. labor force. It was created in 1965 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an executive order strengthening the provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned racial discrimination by employers.\n\n\nOn his second day in office, President Donald Trump labeled O.F.C.C.P.’s efforts to enforce the 1964 Civil Rights Act illegal and discriminatory — presumably against white people. He signed his own executive order revoking Johnson’s on behalf of, as he put it, “hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American dream.”\n\n\nYet in the opening months of his second term, Trump has capitalized on the unpopularity of equality efforts among some Americans, glibly wielding the language of D.E.I. to initiate the broadest and most significant assault on civil rights and racial integration in this country in more than a century.\n\n\nConservatives have spent decades chipping away both at civil rights protections and the national will to address racial inequality. Since the racial reckoning of 2020, Republicans have toppled affirmative action in college admissions and waged an enormously successful campaign to make the language of equity and inclusion anathema, to label books and lessons about the nation’s history “anti-white” and “divisive” and to prohibit everything from Black studies to university diversity offices. And earlier this month, the Supreme Court, which over the years has made it increasingly challenging for Black Americans to prove discrimination, has now made it easier for straight white people to do so.\n\n\nThe Education Department sent a letter to all educational institutions receiving federal funds asserting without evidence that they were engaging in “pervasive and repugnant race-based” discrimination against white and Asian students. Federal data shows that Black students are disproportionately concentrated in schools with fewer resources and less funding, and experience significant academic disparities. And yet the letter told public schools and universities that they had 14 days to purge all diversity and equity efforts — which include programs that try to help diversify teaching staffs and help Black students close the achievement gaps they suffer from nationwide — or lose access to federal funds.\n\n\nBut probably the starkest change is the redirecting of the Department of Justice away from fighting anti-Black discrimination and toward eliminating integration efforts. Harmeet Dhillon, the new head of the department’s Civil Rights Division, sent a memo to the staff making it clear the mandate going forward would be to enforce Trump’s executive orders targeting diversity programs.\n\n(A long, well written and researched article, very much worth clicking through)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNSF Indirect Cost Cap Unlawful, Judge Rules\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/24/federal-judge-vacates-nsf-indirect-cost-cap\n\nfederal judge tossed out the National Science Foundation’s policy capping reimbursements for costs indirectly related to research, finding “severe” deficiencies in the agency’s reasoning for the plan as well as “errors of law.”\n\n\nThe ruling from Judge Indira Talwani of the District of Massachusetts is the first final judgment against the 15 percent cap, which three other federal agencies have also sought to implement. Judges have temporarily blocked those caps, but in this lawsuit, the plaintiffs sought summary judgement, which allows the judge to reach a final decision without a trial.\n\n\nThirteen universities along with the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and the American Council on Education sued the NSF in May to block the cap, arguing the policy would cut funding to institutions and risk the country’s standing “as a world leader in scientific discovery.” The government’s lawyers said in court filings that the cap would have meant a cut of $432.3 million for colleges and universities in fiscal year 2024.\n\n\nTrump Administration Ousts National Science Foundation from Headquarters Building\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administration-ousts-national-science-foundation-from-headquarters/\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development is expected to announce Wednesday that it’s moving into the headquarters of the National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia, according to the union representing NSF employees.\n\n\nThe union, Soriano wrote, “understands that there is no planning except that the HUD secretary may take over the 18th and 19th floors” and start planning the HUD move over the next two years. “There is no planning for NSF, no identified future location, appropriation for a new building or a move,” he wrote.\n\n(A bluesky post lists HUD secretaries designs to take over the 19th floor for him; build out an executive dining room, reserve 5 personal parking spaces, have exclusive use of 1 elevator, have all assistants on the 18th floor)\nAlso\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/06/25/housing-hud-relocation/\n\nThe move will displace about 1,800 employees at the National Science Foundation, which has faced massive spending cuts under the Trump administration. Administration officials on Wednesday did not say where those NSF workers would end up, but Peters said the search for a new location would aim to minimize disruption to those employees’ lives and work.\n\n\nThe frustration added to broader discontent at HUD, the backbone of the federal government’s housing policy. Since Trump’s inauguration, the department has sought to slash funding for fair housing efforts, rental assistance, housing vouchers and homelessness prevention. So many staffers took the second-round buyout offer that officials are trying to get people to voluntarily move into vacant roles.\n\n\n“This callous disregard for taxpayer dollars and NSF employees comes after the Administration already cut NSF’s budget, staff and science grants and forced NSF employees back into the office,” the union said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump admin curtails colleges’ defense research\n\n[Politico Weekly Education email]\n\nFUNDING CUTS: The Department of Defense is shrinking research funding at various colleges and universities, a move that academics say curtails projects that keep U.S. troops safe.\n\n\nEarlier this month, the administration notified universities it would cut facility and administrative reimbursements to 15 percent for all DOD research grants focused on protecting military service members and strengthening national defense. These rates are negotiated between individual institutions and the government, but often fall between 50 percent and 65 percent.\n\n\nSeparate from the lawsuit, Cornell received 75 stop-work orders from DOD, which affected research pertaining to national defense, cybersecurity, and health.\n\nhttps://statements.cornell.edu/2025/20250408-federal-research-funding.cfm\n\n\n\n\nThe Education Department is paying us millions not to work\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/23/education-department-layoffs-doge-afge/\n\nNearly two million student loan borrowers are at risk of having their wages garnished this summer\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/student-loan-wage-garnishment-07fc4d2a?st=wKEnzN&reflink=article_gmail_share\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/financial-aid/2025/06/24/federal-cuts-could-lead-reduced-financial-aid-offers\n\n\n\n\n\nCongress Eyes Cap on Parent PLUS Loans\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/financial-aid/2025/06/25/advocates-say-parent-plus-caps-will-reduce-college-access\n\nBoth House and Senate Republicans want to cap how much parents can borrow via the Parent PLUS loan program, though they disagree about the amount. The House plan limits parents to $50,000 total, while the Senate plan would allow them to borrow up to $65,000 per dependent. Currently, the loans are uncapped, so parents can borrow as much as they need.\n\n\n(Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said at a recent hearing that about 34 percent of those with Parent PLUS loans borrow above the House’s proposed cap of $50,000.)\n\n\nThe proposed caps are just one of many cuts to student aid that Congress has included in recent proposals as part of the process known as reconciliation. The House version of the bill, which includes steeper cuts and restrictions across the board, passed in late May, while the Senate continues to finalize its proposal and is planning to vote on it as soon as this week. President Donald Trump has said he wants to sign what he’s dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by July 4.\n\n\nBut college-accessibility advocates have warned that the legislation will inevitably make college less affordable and loans more difficult to pay off for millions of Americans.\n\n\nTransUnion: 5M Borrowers Could Default by September\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/25/transunion-5m-borrowers-could-default-september\n\nThe TransUnion analysis found that as of April 2025, nearly one-third of borrowers were more than 90 days past due on their loans—a roughly 10-percentage-point jump compared to February 2025. Before the government paused payments in spring 2020 because of the pandemic, just 11.7 percent of borrowers fell into this category.\n\n\nBorrowers default when they are 270 days behind on their payments. TransUnion expects about 1.8 million borrowers to default in July, followed by another million in August and then another two million in September.\n\n\nThe Education Department resumed debt collections in May—the first time in more than three years that borrowers who defaulted on their loans faced the harshest consequences. Since that announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and other officials have worked to spread the word about the consequences of default and defended the restart as necessary to shore up the student loan system. They’ve encouraged borrowers to get in touch with their student loan servicer and urged colleges to get involved as well.\n\n\nThe Trump administration did plan to withhold some federal benefits such as tax returns and Social Security checks, but officials later backed off that part of that plan.\n\n\nBut so far, the department has held off on restarting its automatic wage garnishment system, in which they can dock up to 15 percent of a defaulted borrower’s paycheck. The agency plans to resume that system this summer.\n\n\nGraduate Programs Face a Federal Reckoning\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/graduate/2025/06/26/can-graduate-programs-survive-federal-loan-caps\n\nCongress wants to significantly cut back on federal loans for grad students. That could decimate the highly profitable graduate degree market—and limit who has access to it.\n\n\nThe Senate version of the reconciliation bill, which President Donald Trump has urged Congress to pass as early as next week, would cap professional degree loans at $200,000 and all other graduate loans at $100,000. Both the House and the Senate also proposed completely eliminating Grad PLUS, an unsubsidized federal loan with no borrowing limit that has helped students from modest backgrounds pay for graduate degrees since 2006.\n\n(This doesn’t seem to have an impact on CUNY students)\n\nEducation Department Outlines Plan to Change Debt-Relief Program for Public Servants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/06/26/education-department-outlines-plan-change-pslf-rules\n(This is a bit misplaced, but this would impact CUNY students)\n\nCritics worry that the changes could derail debt relief for borrowers and allow the administration to block funds from reaching public servants who work in fields or for employers that the president disagrees with.\n\n\n“The law does not empower the Secretary of Education to opine on the supposed illegality of a public service employer’s mission—an unprecedented exercise of executive power that extends far beyond the Higher Education Act,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, which shared a copy of the issue paper with Inside Higher Ed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard and Trump Restart Talks to Potentially End Bitter Dispute\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/politics/harvard-federal-funding-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIt is unclear how close both sides are to a potential deal and the exact terms any final agreement would entail. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said it was “very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so.”\n\n\nHarvard has been widely praised by Democrats, academics, its alumni and democracy advocates for fighting the Trump administration. But top Harvard officials, according to two people briefed on the matter, have become increasingly convinced in recent weeks that the school has little choice but to try to strike a deal with the White House.\n\n\nThe Harvard officials believe that if the university remains at odds with the administration that it is likely to become far smaller and less ambitious as Mr. Trump tries to keep pummeling it with funding cuts, federal investigations and limits on visas for international students.\n\n\nIn exchange, Harvard would agree to take even more aggressive action than it already has to address issues such as antisemitism, race, and viewpoint diversity. The White House has pushed Harvard to make new commitments to change its admissions and hiring practices, one of the people close to the negotiations said.\n\n\nThe White House, according to one person briefed on the negotiations, hopes that an agreement with Harvard might serve as a framework for other elite colleges to strike deals with Mr. Trump. Other schools have been in discussions with the Trump administration about making deals that would keep their federal funding intact and avoid the president’s ire, two of the people said.\n\n\nAmong other conditions, the administration wanted Harvard to establish “merit based” hiring and admissions policies, and to see the influence of its faculty curbed. It sought a review for “viewpoint diversity,” the shutdown of any programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, and an outside review to examine “those programs and departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.”\n\n\nThe government also asked for Harvard to adjust its “recruitment, screening and admissions of international students,” audits of university data and reports “at least until the end of 2028” about the university’s compliance with the Trump administration’s conditions.\n\n\nUntil recently, though, Harvard’s top board resisted talks. The members directed the school’s battalion of lawyers, many of them fixtures of conservative legal circles, not to engage with the government.\n\n\nThe calculus has since shifted, in parallel with a handful of courtroom successes for Harvard and Mr. Trump’s public venting that the university had drawn a favorable judge.\n\n(Anyways, if Harvard bends it will be a gigantic blow to higher education.

It does not address President Donald Trump’s executive proclamation from earlier this month banning the State Department from issuing visas to international students and researchers attending Harvard; a temporary restriction on that ban expired June 20.\n\n\nNYTimes: ‘Are We Past Peak Harvard?’: 3 Writers Mull Higher Education’s Woes\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/opinion/trump-higher-education-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLarry Summers: Maybe, but there are countervailing forces. Harvard’s relative prestige rises with the square of the distance from Cambridge, and so a global talent competition helps it. The greatest universities are drivers of progress. The 21st century will be a center of the life sciences, and because of Harvard, M.I.T. and their affiliates, Boston and Cambridge are ground zero, creating a flywheel effect with Stanford and digital technology. If anything, the trend is toward a higher fraction of government, business, artistic elites coming from elite schools as they get better at drawing talent.\n\n\nSummers: The trend could break if Trump stays super-destructive, courts are super-tolerant and the universities don’t adapt and settle. That is a real worry. My best guess, though, is that the need for universities as economic engines, the enforcement of law and the fact that there is low-hanging fruit for cultural correction in the universities will carry the day. I don’t think there is yet evidence of leading universities losing their appeal. Yes, there is a need to walk back from crazy, as there was after the 1960s. My guess is this will happen. You will see versions of Stanford’s Hoover Institution on many campuses, more emphasis on nonideological science and a big walk back on identity politics.\n\n\nBruni: Ross, it’s clear that Trump and his allies actually don’t want sweeping protections for free speech. They correctly called out intolerance on the left but are now replacing it with intolerance from the right. When you’re essentially banning any mention of D.E.I., detaining students for political viewpoints they’ve articulated, putting institutions on notice that you’ll punish them for any deviation from just-two-genders orthodoxy, well, Trump is swapping one cancel culture for another.

Bollinger, a former president of Columbia University and the University of Michigan, said that Harvard stood at a critical juncture in the history of American academia.\n\n\n“How you conduct yourself in these moments will say a lot over the future,” he said.\n\n\nHe warned that allowing the government a say in hiring was a perilous threat to “a core, core academic freedom principle.”\n\n\nMany around academia are wary of the White House’s record. …\n\n\nWith stakes high, White House pushes negotiations with Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/24/with-stakes-high-white-house-pushes-negotiations-with-harvard/\n\nThe Trump administration is ramping up negotiations with Harvard University in an effort to reach an end to its months-long battle with the elite school, two senior White House officials have said, as Harvard has been racking up legal wins in court.\n\n\nThe administration expects a deal to land by the end of the month, one official said, and hopes the agreement would make a big enough splash to “basically be a blueprint for the rest of higher education.” The White House officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\n\nHarvard declined to comment.\n\n\nHarvard allies, free-speech advocates and others have feared that the Trump administration would use its attacks on Harvard to exert control over universities nationwide and dismantle academic freedom. Whatever the outcome, the case will create a significant precedent, said higher education attorney Sarah Hartley.\n\n\n“This is the playbook to be used with other universities by the government going forward,” said Hartley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm BCLP. “It, in many ways, is being used as a test of democracy and what the government can force on private institutions.”\n\n\nThe government may have more motivation to come to a settlement outside of court than Harvard does, said higher education attorney Jodie Ferise, who believes Harvard has a stronger legal case.\n\n\n“The White House has every incentive to want to reach some kind of compromise, because I don’t think they’ll win this case,” she said.\n\n\n“The government cannot attempt a hostile takeover of any private institution, much less a private college or university, in order to impose its preferred vision of ideological balance,” the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in a brief filed with seven other organizations, including the right-leaning Cato Institute and Rutherford Institute.\n\n\nHarvard scientist accused of smuggling frog embryos faces new charges\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/26/harvard-researcher-frog-embryos-ice/\n\nIf convicted on the felony smuggling charge, Petrova could face up to 20 years in prison and be fined as much as $250,000.

One of the laws requires public colleges and universities to eliminate programs with low numbers of degrees averaged over a three-year period. The cutoff is 15 graduates for a bachelor’s degree, seven for a master’s and three for a doctorate.\n\n\nSo far, most faculty don’t know what to expect. President-elect of the Bloomington Faculty Council Heather Akou said she hasn’t heard anything from the university but that it’s “aggressively” moving to get in line with the law. “There are going to be big changes for this university, and the pace at which this is being pushed through is not designed for positive outcomes,” she said. “I have to say that my faculty colleagues are in panic to a degree that I have never seen before.”\n\n\nMost of the degrees with low numbers of recipients are in the humanities and languages. Jewish Studies, Classical Studies and multiple language departments could lose their main offerings. From 2020 to 2022, IU Bloomington conferred more humanities doctorates than any other university in the country, according to data from Carnegie Classifications. It also ranks first for number of languages taught, for now.\n\n\n“Even tenured faculty are wondering, am I going to have a job in two months?” Akou said. “We’re scheduled to teach classes. Will I be allowed to teach the classes I’m scheduled to teach this fall? I don’t know. That’s really the level of chaos and confusion that’s going on right now.” The university declined an interview, but spokesperson Mark Bode wrote in an email that “IU is working with campus leaders to comply with the process mandated by state law.”\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Dept. says it is investigating Univ. of California hiring practices\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/26/university-california-trump-dei-investigation-hiring-justice/\n\nIn a letter to University of California President Michael Drake dated Thursday, the Justice Department claimed a strategic growth plan created by the UC system that mentions diversity in hiring suggests that the educational institution “may be engaged” in discriminatory employment practices based on race or sex.\n\n(May be the only people who take a strategic plan so seriously; ours is here https://www.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/about/chancellor/strategic-roadmap/CUNY_Lifting_New_York.pdf )\n\nThe antisemitism probe at the UC system is supposed to determine whether a “hostile work environment” has existed for Jewish employees on its campuses. The investigation announced Monday, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, will similarly seek to determine whether discrimination has existed in UC hiring.\n\n\n“It is important to note that we have not reached any conclusions about the subject matter of the investigation. We intend to consider all relevant information,” Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said in her letter to Drake.\n\n\nDhillon’s letter did not detail specific allegations of instances of hiring discrimination. She cited the University of California 2030 Capacity Plan as having “precipitated unlawful action,” specifically employment practices that may have discriminated against “employees, job applicants and training program participants based on race and sex.”\n\n\nIn its strategic plan, the University of California says it is “committed to increasing the diversity of its faculty, both underrepresented minorities and female faculty.” The plan discusses efforts to diversify the faculty so that campuses better reflect the population of California, a goal partially rooted in helping populations who are less likely to graduate from college earn degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Budget Cuts and a Loss of Trust Threaten Higher Ed’s Workforce\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/career-development/2025/06/23/budget-cuts-loss-trust-threaten-higher-eds\n\nThe consequences of the sector’s financial instability and ongoing government attacks include anxiety among faculty and staff feeling the strain of hiring freezes, uncertainty about internal grant opportunities and even questions about having enough staff on hand to continue delivering basic services, said Kevin McClure, a professor of higher education and chair of the Department of Educational Leadership at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.\n\n\nHe added that leaders who have compromised their institutional values in response to political pressure have eroded the trust of their campus communities.\n\n\nFIU Donor Pulls Funds Over President’s Politics\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/26/fiu-donor-pulls-funds-over-presidents-politics\n\nA Miami businessman has walked back a $1 million donation to Florida International University after lawmakers repealed in-state tuition for undocumented students, The Miami Herald reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nNSF Grant Terminations 2025\n\nhttps://grant-watch.us/\n\nGrant Watch is a project to track the termination of grants of scientific research agencies under the Trump administration in 2025.

    "text": "The Republican Plot to Un-Educate America | The New Republic\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/197017/budget-bill-kill-higher-education\n\nTrump’s “big, beautiful bill” is an extinction-level event for higher education that would annihilate the country’s intellectual potential.\n\n\nFor colleges and universities, the potential fallout is hard to overstate. Whatever schools survive are likely to be drained of working- and middle-class families, instead populated only by society’s most wealthy. As it is, millions of people rightly consider universities to be a costly endeavor that is irrelevant to their everyday life. But rather than remaking higher ed into a vibrant and more democratic institution, this bill threatens to do the opposite. It will cement the stereotype of higher education as an elite institution into an ironclad reality. On June 25, student debtors and their allies will be protesting these devastating cuts in Washington, D.C. But so far, very few elected officials are sounding the alarm on these issues with the fever pitch they deserve, let alone doing the work required to slow down and obstruct their passage into law.\n\n\nIn the words of influential conservative activist Christopher Rufo, “Reforming the student loan programs could put the whole university sector into a significant recession” and state of “existential terror.” The goal is to use economic policy to impose an unpopular and stifling ideological agenda, exacted by punitive student debt.\n\n\nThese cuts won’t just harm students who rely on loans to afford college; they will take the doors off colleges’ and universities’ capacity to expand minds and redistribute opportunity. Lost revenue will encourage schools to close programs, squeeze staff, and perhaps shutter entirely. A proposed endowment tax for colleges and universities has prompted fury among higher education lobbyists, but those players have said very little about the bill’s vigorous imposition of debt as a tool of social control.\n\n\nContemporary Republicans are even more brazen. Consider a recent report released by the Heritage Foundation that recommends terminating higher education “subsidies” and student loan cancellation in order to “increase the married birthrate.” What does this goulash mean in plain English?",

West Point didn’t answer most questions that Inside Higher Ed posed to it, including whether books have actually been removed.\n\n\nAt the Naval Academy, Tom McCarthy resigned from his role as history department chair this month, The Baltimore Sun reported.

Simon often assigns readings that describe how the families her students might one day serve have been impacted by more than a century of housing, employment, and education discrimination. The associate professor has encouraged her students to engage in spirited discussions about race, even assigning a project in which they advocate for or against a social-justice issue.\n\n\nDoing any of those things today, she argues in a federal lawsuit, could get her fired from the state flagship, where she’s taught for 25 years. Last year, the state’s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, signed into law a sweeping bill that restricts what professors can teach about race. If any of their lessons veer into what conservative politicians have deemed “divisive concepts,” faculty members risk being reported, investigated, and potentially fired.\n\n\nBut over the past two years, more than a dozen laws have been enacted that either limit which classes can be taught or imposed restrictions on what professors can say in the classroom, according to a Chronicle analysis of state legislation and a compilation of what PEN America calls “educational gag orders.”\n\n\nThis year especially “has been a banner year for censorship at a state level across the country,” said Amy B. Reid, senior manager at PEN America’s Freedom to Learn program. “The point of a lot of these restrictions is to put people on guard, worried that anything or everything could be prohibited so you really have to watch what you say.”",

It also bars the use of microphones and drums.\n\n\nRepublicans in Texas say the proposal will prevent campus disruption and intimidation seen during last year’s pro-Palestinian protests. But critics across the political spectrum, such as the free speech advocacy group Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, say the proposal is too broad and threatens all forms of expressive activity.\n\n\n“Wearing a MAGA hat or a Bernie [Sanders] T-shirt would be prohibited between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. because the political apparel is an expressive act, and therefore covered as an expressive activity,” said Tyler Coward, FIRE’s lead counsel for government affairs.\n\n\nUnder the proposed law, universities could bar a guest speaker from campus if school officials believe there will be a large protest, Coward said.\n\n\nTexas Governor Signs Bill to Limit Expressive Activity on Campuses\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/free-speech/2025/06/23/texas-passes-bill-limiting-expressive-activity-campus\n\nTexas governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial bill that would restrict expressive activities on college campuses, reversing some of the rights afforded by a 2019 bill intended to protect Texans’ ability to protest on campuses.\n\n\nTexas Governor Signs Law Giving Presidents Control of Faculty Senates\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/24/texas-passes-law-presidents-control-faculty-senates\n(These were highlighted in an earlier digest, but worth repeating…)\n\nSenate Bill 37 says that only an institution’s governing board can create a faculty council or senate. If a board decides to keep one, the college or university president gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary” and prescribe how the body conducts meetings.\n\n\nUnless the institution’s board decides otherwise, faculty governing bodies must shrink to no more than 60 members. The Texas A&M University Faculty Senate currently has 122.\n\n\nThe 60 members must include at least two representatives from each of the colleges and schools that comprise the institution—including what the law describes vaguely as “one member appointed by the president or chief executive officer of the institution,” with the rest elected by the faculty of the particular school or college. This could mean that half of a faculty senate would be chosen by the president, barring an exemption by the institution’s board.\n\n\nSB 37 also says an institution’s provost can recommend to the president that members be “immediately removed” for failing to attend meetings or not conducting their “responsibilities within the council’s or senate’s parameters,” or for “similar misconduct.”\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Says He Wants to Fund More Trade Schools.

But many of those grants focused on serving Black students and Black communities, a core part of the land-grant institution’s mission.\n\n\nAs the VPs fretted over how they would retain vital research grants, one administrator quipped, “HBCUs won’t be affected because they don’t look at HBCUs as DEI.”\n\n\nQuick, the only HBCU administrator in attendance, recalled thinking, “That’s ridiculous, and it’s absolutely naïve. We absolutely would get hit. … And that’s exactly what has happened.”\n\n\nIn total, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation have canceled more than $140 million in grants at HBCUs since March, according to a Chronicle analysis of two databases tracking grant cancellations.\n\n\nThe NIH in March said that plans to enhance diversity are no longer required in training-grant applications, and “those included in applications under review will not be evaluated or considered in funding decisions.”\n\n\nThe NSF said in April that research supported by the federal government must “aim to create opportunities for all Americans everywhere.” Federally supported research on protected groups must be open to all nonprotected groups.\n\n\nThe agency has not provided guidance on what initiatives are considered DEI.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Justice Dept.

Dhillon, the Justice Department’s top civil rights lawyer, has also been involved in negotiations with the university.\n\n\nBefore becoming the University of Virginia’s president, Mr. Ryan served as the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he was praised for his commitment to D.E.I. programs.\n\n\nThe administration’s attempt to assert federal influence over state university leadership decisions is also illustrative of how Mr. Trump’s political appointees continue to wield the Justice Department’s investigative powers to achieve policy goals long sought by a top Trump adviser, Stephen Miller.\n\n\nBut Mr. Ryan has been singled out by the Trump administration as his steps toward compliance have been criticized by conservative groups as insufficient. America First Legal, a nonprofit started by Mr. Miller, last month accused the University of Virginia of paying lip service to Mr. Trump’s orders by simply running the same diversity programs under a different name. The group issued a news release last month that called on the Justice Department to “hold UVA accountable.”\n\n(also here)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda\n\nNYTimes: How Trump Upended 60 Years of Civil Rights in Two Months\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/27/magazine/trump-civil-rights-law-discrimination.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast year, a little-known office in the U.S. Department of Labor helped Black workers at a Texas medical center recover $900,000 in back wages, and Black workers at a Caterpillar manufacturing plant in Illinois recover $800,000, each time over allegations that those applicants lost out on jobs because of their race. Called the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, this division investigates and fights employment discrimination for one-fifth of the U.S. labor force. It was created in 1965 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an executive order strengthening the provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned racial discrimination by employers.\n\n\nOn his second day in office, President Donald Trump labeled O.F.C.C.P.’s efforts to enforce the 1964 Civil Rights Act illegal and discriminatory — presumably against white people. He signed his own executive order revoking Johnson’s on behalf of, as he put it, “hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American dream.”\n\n\nYet in the opening months of his second term, Trump has capitalized on the unpopularity of equality efforts among some Americans, glibly wielding the language of D.E.I. to initiate the broadest and most significant assault on civil rights and racial integration in this country in more than a century.\n\n\nConservatives have spent decades chipping away both at civil rights protections and the national will to address racial inequality. Since the racial reckoning of 2020, Republicans have toppled affirmative action in college admissions and waged an enormously successful campaign to make the language of equity and inclusion anathema, to label books and lessons about the nation’s history “anti-white” and “divisive” and to prohibit everything from Black studies to university diversity offices. And earlier this month, the Supreme Court, which over the years has made it increasingly challenging for Black Americans to prove discrimination, has now made it easier for straight white people to do so.\n\n\nThe Education Department sent a letter to all educational institutions receiving federal funds asserting without evidence that they were engaging in “pervasive and repugnant race-based” discrimination against white and Asian students. Federal data shows that Black students are disproportionately concentrated in schools with fewer resources and less funding, and experience significant academic disparities. And yet the letter told public schools and universities that they had 14 days to purge all diversity and equity efforts — which include programs that try to help diversify teaching staffs and help Black students close the achievement gaps they suffer from nationwide — or lose access to federal funds.\n\n\nBut probably the starkest change is the redirecting of the Department of Justice away from fighting anti-Black discrimination and toward eliminating integration efforts. Harmeet Dhillon, the new head of the department’s Civil Rights Division, sent a memo to the staff making it clear the mandate going forward would be to enforce Trump’s executive orders targeting diversity programs.\n\n(A long, well written and researched article, very much worth clicking through)",

    "text": "NSF Indirect Cost Cap Unlawful, Judge Rules\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/24/federal-judge-vacates-nsf-indirect-cost-cap\n\nfederal judge tossed out the National Science Foundation’s policy capping reimbursements for costs indirectly related to research, finding “severe” deficiencies in the agency’s reasoning for the plan as well as “errors of law.”\n\n\nThe ruling from Judge Indira Talwani of the District of Massachusetts is the first final judgment against the 15 percent cap, which three other federal agencies have also sought to implement. Judges have temporarily blocked those caps, but in this lawsuit, the plaintiffs sought summary judgement, which allows the judge to reach a final decision without a trial.\n\n\nThirteen universities along with the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and the American Council on Education sued the NSF in May to block the cap, arguing the policy would cut funding to institutions and risk the country’s standing “as a world leader in scientific discovery.” The government’s lawyers said in court filings that the cap would have meant a cut of $432.3 million for colleges and universities in fiscal year 2024.\n\n\nTrump Administration Ousts National Science Foundation from Headquarters Building\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administration-ousts-national-science-foundation-from-headquarters/\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development is expected to announce Wednesday that it’s moving into the headquarters of the National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia, according to the union representing NSF employees.\n\n\nThe union, Soriano wrote, “understands that there is no planning except that the HUD secretary may take over the 18th and 19th floors” and start planning the HUD move over the next two years. “There is no planning for NSF, no identified future location, appropriation for a new building or a move,” he wrote.\n\n(A bluesky post lists HUD secretaries designs to take over the 19th floor for him; build out an executive dining room, reserve 5 personal parking spaces, have exclusive use of 1 elevator, have all assistants on the 18th floor)\nAlso\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/06/25/housing-hud-relocation/\n\nThe move will displace about 1,800 employees at the National Science Foundation, which has faced massive spending cuts under the Trump administration. Administration officials on Wednesday did not say where those NSF workers would end up, but Peters said the search for a new location would aim to minimize disruption to those employees’ lives and work.\n\n\nThe frustration added to broader discontent at HUD, the backbone of the federal government’s housing policy. Since Trump’s inauguration, the department has sought to slash funding for fair housing efforts, rental assistance, housing vouchers and homelessness prevention. So many staffers took the second-round buyout offer that officials are trying to get people to voluntarily move into vacant roles.\n\n\n“This callous disregard for taxpayer dollars and NSF employees comes after the Administration already cut NSF’s budget, staff and science grants and forced NSF employees back into the office,” the union said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump admin curtails colleges’ defense research\n\n[Politico Weekly Education email]\n\nFUNDING CUTS: The Department of Defense is shrinking research funding at various colleges and universities, a move that academics say curtails projects that keep U.S. troops safe.\n\n\nEarlier this month, the administration notified universities it would cut facility and administrative reimbursements to 15 percent for all DOD research grants focused on protecting military service members and strengthening national defense. These rates are negotiated between individual institutions and the government, but often fall between 50 percent and 65 percent.\n\n\nSeparate from the lawsuit, Cornell received 75 stop-work orders from DOD, which affected research pertaining to national defense, cybersecurity, and health.\n\nhttps://statements.cornell.edu/2025/20250408-federal-research-funding.cfm\n\n\n\n\nThe Education Department is paying us millions not to work\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/23/education-department-layoffs-doge-afge/\n\nNearly two million student loan borrowers are at risk of having their wages garnished this summer\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/student-loan-wage-garnishment-07fc4d2a?st=wKEnzN&reflink=article_gmail_share\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/financial-aid/2025/06/24/federal-cuts-could-lead-reduced-financial-aid-offers",

    "text": "Congress Eyes Cap on Parent PLUS Loans\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/financial-aid/2025/06/25/advocates-say-parent-plus-caps-will-reduce-college-access\n\nBoth House and Senate Republicans want to cap how much parents can borrow via the Parent PLUS loan program, though they disagree about the amount. The House plan limits parents to $50,000 total, while the Senate plan would allow them to borrow up to $65,000 per dependent. Currently, the loans are uncapped, so parents can borrow as much as they need.\n\n\n(Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said at a recent hearing that about 34 percent of those with Parent PLUS loans borrow above the House’s proposed cap of $50,000.)\n\n\nThe proposed caps are just one of many cuts to student aid that Congress has included in recent proposals as part of the process known as reconciliation. The House version of the bill, which includes steeper cuts and restrictions across the board, passed in late May, while the Senate continues to finalize its proposal and is planning to vote on it as soon as this week. President Donald Trump has said he wants to sign what he’s dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by July 4.\n\n\nBut college-accessibility advocates have warned that the legislation will inevitably make college less affordable and loans more difficult to pay off for millions of Americans.\n\n\nTransUnion: 5M Borrowers Could Default by September\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/25/transunion-5m-borrowers-could-default-september\n\nThe TransUnion analysis found that as of April 2025, nearly one-third of borrowers were more than 90 days past due on their loans—a roughly 10-percentage-point jump compared to February 2025. Before the government paused payments in spring 2020 because of the pandemic, just 11.7 percent of borrowers fell into this category.\n\n\nBorrowers default when they are 270 days behind on their payments. TransUnion expects about 1.8 million borrowers to default in July, followed by another million in August and then another two million in September.\n\n\nThe Education Department resumed debt collections in May—the first time in more than three years that borrowers who defaulted on their loans faced the harshest consequences. Since that announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and other officials have worked to spread the word about the consequences of default and defended the restart as necessary to shore up the student loan system. They’ve encouraged borrowers to get in touch with their student loan servicer and urged colleges to get involved as well.\n\n\nThe Trump administration did plan to withhold some federal benefits such as tax returns and Social Security checks, but officials later backed off that part of that plan.\n\n\nBut so far, the department has held off on restarting its automatic wage garnishment system, in which they can dock up to 15 percent of a defaulted borrower’s paycheck. The agency plans to resume that system this summer.\n\n\nGraduate Programs Face a Federal Reckoning\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/graduate/2025/06/26/can-graduate-programs-survive-federal-loan-caps\n\nCongress wants to significantly cut back on federal loans for grad students. That could decimate the highly profitable graduate degree market—and limit who has access to it.\n\n\nThe Senate version of the reconciliation bill, which President Donald Trump has urged Congress to pass as early as next week, would cap professional degree loans at $200,000 and all other graduate loans at $100,000. Both the House and the Senate also proposed completely eliminating Grad PLUS, an unsubsidized federal loan with no borrowing limit that has helped students from modest backgrounds pay for graduate degrees since 2006.\n\n(This doesn’t seem to have an impact on CUNY students)\n\nEducation Department Outlines Plan to Change Debt-Relief Program for Public Servants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/06/26/education-department-outlines-plan-change-pslf-rules\n(This is a bit misplaced, but this would impact CUNY students)\n\nCritics worry that the changes could derail debt relief for borrowers and allow the administration to block funds from reaching public servants who work in fields or for employers that the president disagrees with.\n\n\n“The law does not empower the Secretary of Education to opine on the supposed illegality of a public service employer’s mission—an unprecedented exercise of executive power that extends far beyond the Higher Education Act,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, which shared a copy of the issue paper with Inside Higher Ed.",

    "text": "NYTimes: Harvard and Trump Restart Talks to Potentially End Bitter Dispute\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/politics/harvard-federal-funding-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIt is unclear how close both sides are to a potential deal and the exact terms any final agreement would entail. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said it was “very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so.”\n\n\nHarvard has been widely praised by Democrats, academics, its alumni and democracy advocates for fighting the Trump administration. But top Harvard officials, according to two people briefed on the matter, have become increasingly convinced in recent weeks that the school has little choice but to try to strike a deal with the White House.\n\n\nThe Harvard officials believe that if the university remains at odds with the administration that it is likely to become far smaller and less ambitious as Mr. Trump tries to keep pummeling it with funding cuts, federal investigations and limits on visas for international students.\n\n\nIn exchange, Harvard would agree to take even more aggressive action than it already has to address issues such as antisemitism, race, and viewpoint diversity. The White House has pushed Harvard to make new commitments to change its admissions and hiring practices, one of the people close to the negotiations said.\n\n\nThe White House, according to one person briefed on the negotiations, hopes that an agreement with Harvard might serve as a framework for other elite colleges to strike deals with Mr. Trump. Other schools have been in discussions with the Trump administration about making deals that would keep their federal funding intact and avoid the president’s ire, two of the people said.\n\n\nAmong other conditions, the administration wanted Harvard to establish “merit based” hiring and admissions policies, and to see the influence of its faculty curbed. It sought a review for “viewpoint diversity,” the shutdown of any programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, and an outside review to examine “those programs and departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.”\n\n\nThe government also asked for Harvard to adjust its “recruitment, screening and admissions of international students,” audits of university data and reports “at least until the end of 2028” about the university’s compliance with the Trump administration’s conditions.\n\n\nUntil recently, though, Harvard’s top board resisted talks. The members directed the school’s battalion of lawyers, many of them fixtures of conservative legal circles, not to engage with the government.\n\n\nThe calculus has since shifted, in parallel with a handful of courtroom successes for Harvard and Mr. Trump’s public venting that the university had drawn a favorable judge.\n\n(Anyways, if Harvard bends it will be a gigantic blow to higher education. This article tries to narrow the “deal” to it impacting other top colleges, but this just opens the gates to asking for more and more and more, as the same threats can be reapplied by an administration that doesn’t honor past “deals”.)\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Live Updates: Federal Judge Blocks Efforts to Keep International Students Out of Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/20/us/trump-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nHarvard dispute: A federal judge on Friday froze the Trump administration’s effort to stop international students from enrolling at Harvard University. The preliminary injunction, from a federal court in Boston, allows about 7,000 Harvard students and recent graduates to continue to study and work legally in the United States.

It does not address President Donald Trump’s executive proclamation from earlier this month banning the State Department from issuing visas to international students and researchers attending Harvard; a temporary restriction on that ban expired June 20.\n\n\nNYTimes: ‘Are We Past Peak Harvard?’: 3 Writers Mull Higher Education’s Woes\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/opinion/trump-higher-education-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLarry Summers: Maybe, but there are countervailing forces. Harvard’s relative prestige rises with the square of the distance from Cambridge, and so a global talent competition helps it. The greatest universities are drivers of progress. The 21st century will be a center of the life sciences, and because of Harvard, M.I.T. and their affiliates, Boston and Cambridge are ground zero, creating a flywheel effect with Stanford and digital technology. If anything, the trend is toward a higher fraction of government, business, artistic elites coming from elite schools as they get better at drawing talent.\n\n\nSummers: The trend could break if Trump stays super-destructive, courts are super-tolerant and the universities don’t adapt and settle. That is a real worry. My best guess, though, is that the need for universities as economic engines, the enforcement of law and the fact that there is low-hanging fruit for cultural correction in the universities will carry the day. I don’t think there is yet evidence of leading universities losing their appeal. Yes, there is a need to walk back from crazy, as there was after the 1960s. My guess is this will happen. You will see versions of Stanford’s Hoover Institution on many campuses, more emphasis on nonideological science and a big walk back on identity politics.\n\n\nBruni: Ross, it’s clear that Trump and his allies actually don’t want sweeping protections for free speech. They correctly called out intolerance on the left but are now replacing it with intolerance from the right. When you’re essentially banning any mention of D.E.I., detaining students for political viewpoints they’ve articulated, putting institutions on notice that you’ll punish them for any deviation from just-two-genders orthodoxy, well, Trump is swapping one cancel culture for another. No?\n\n(But there is no convincing Ross Douthat and Larry Summers carries around grudges about faculty for who knows when)\n\nNYTimes: Here Is All the Science at Risk in Trump’s Clash With Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/22/upshot/harvard-funding-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe federal government annually spends billions funding research at Harvard, part of a decades-old system that is little understood by the public but essential to American science.\n\n\nThis spring, nearly every dollar of that payment was cut off by the Trump administration, endangering much of the university’s research.\n\n\nThe New York Times was able to identify more than 900 terminated grants, using court records, government databases and other internal university sources — a near-complete accounting of the cuts in the Trump administration’s escalating campaign to cripple the university.\n\n(Accompanying infographic is top notch)\n\nHarvard flouted the rules.

Bollinger, a former president of Columbia University and the University of Michigan, said that Harvard stood at a critical juncture in the history of American academia.\n\n\n“How you conduct yourself in these moments will say a lot over the future,” he said.\n\n\nHe warned that allowing the government a say in hiring was a perilous threat to “a core, core academic freedom principle.”\n\n\nMany around academia are wary of the White House’s record. …\n\n\nWith stakes high, White House pushes negotiations with Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/24/with-stakes-high-white-house-pushes-negotiations-with-harvard/\n\nThe Trump administration is ramping up negotiations with Harvard University in an effort to reach an end to its months-long battle with the elite school, two senior White House officials have said, as Harvard has been racking up legal wins in court.\n\n\nThe administration expects a deal to land by the end of the month, one official said, and hopes the agreement would make a big enough splash to “basically be a blueprint for the rest of higher education.” The White House officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\n\nHarvard declined to comment.\n\n\nHarvard allies, free-speech advocates and others have feared that the Trump administration would use its attacks on Harvard to exert control over universities nationwide and dismantle academic freedom. Whatever the outcome, the case will create a significant precedent, said higher education attorney Sarah Hartley.\n\n\n“This is the playbook to be used with other universities by the government going forward,” said Hartley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm BCLP. “It, in many ways, is being used as a test of democracy and what the government can force on private institutions.”\n\n\nThe government may have more motivation to come to a settlement outside of court than Harvard does, said higher education attorney Jodie Ferise, who believes Harvard has a stronger legal case.\n\n\n“The White House has every incentive to want to reach some kind of compromise, because I don’t think they’ll win this case,” she said.\n\n\n“The government cannot attempt a hostile takeover of any private institution, much less a private college or university, in order to impose its preferred vision of ideological balance,” the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in a brief filed with seven other organizations, including the right-leaning Cato Institute and Rutherford Institute.\n\n\nHarvard scientist accused of smuggling frog embryos faces new charges\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/26/harvard-researcher-frog-embryos-ice/\n\nIf convicted on the felony smuggling charge, Petrova could face up to 20 years in prison and be fined as much as $250,000. The new charges related to false statements are punishable by up to five years in prison and another $250,000 fine.\n\n\n\n\n\nHundreds of IU degree programs at risk of disappearing – WFIU/WTIU News\n\n(Thanks KB for sharing)\nhttps://wfiunews.wordpress.com/2025/06/24/hundreds-of-iu-degree-programs-at-risk-of-disappearing/\n\nIndiana University could lose hundreds of degree programs as part of compliance with an array of new laws affecting higher education that passed at the 11th hour of the legislative session. One of the laws requires public colleges and universities to eliminate programs with low numbers of degrees averaged over a three-year period. The cutoff is 15 graduates for a bachelor’s degree, seven for a master’s and three for a doctorate.\n\n\nSo far, most faculty don’t know what to expect. President-elect of the Bloomington Faculty Council Heather Akou said she hasn’t heard anything from the university but that it’s “aggressively” moving to get in line with the law. “There are going to be big changes for this university, and the pace at which this is being pushed through is not designed for positive outcomes,” she said. “I have to say that my faculty colleagues are in panic to a degree that I have never seen before.”\n\n\nMost of the degrees with low numbers of recipients are in the humanities and languages. Jewish Studies, Classical Studies and multiple language departments could lose their main offerings. From 2020 to 2022, IU Bloomington conferred more humanities doctorates than any other university in the country, according to data from Carnegie Classifications. It also ranks first for number of languages taught, for now.\n\n\n“Even tenured faculty are wondering, am I going to have a job in two months?” Akou said. “We’re scheduled to teach classes. Will I be allowed to teach the classes I’m scheduled to teach this fall? I don’t know. That’s really the level of chaos and confusion that’s going on right now.” The university declined an interview, but spokesperson Mark Bode wrote in an email that “IU is working with campus leaders to comply with the process mandated by state law.”\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Dept. says it is investigating Univ. of California hiring practices\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/26/university-california-trump-dei-investigation-hiring-justice/\n\nIn a letter to University of California President Michael Drake dated Thursday, the Justice Department claimed a strategic growth plan created by the UC system that mentions diversity in hiring suggests that the educational institution “may be engaged” in discriminatory employment practices based on race or sex.\n\n(May be the only people who take a strategic plan so seriously; ours is here https://www.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/about/chancellor/strategic-roadmap/CUNY_Lifting_New_York.pdf )\n\nThe antisemitism probe at the UC system is supposed to determine whether a “hostile work environment” has existed for Jewish employees on its campuses. The investigation announced Monday, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, will similarly seek to determine whether discrimination has existed in UC hiring.\n\n\n“It is important to note that we have not reached any conclusions about the subject matter of the investigation. We intend to consider all relevant information,” Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said in her letter to Drake.\n\n\nDhillon’s letter did not detail specific allegations of instances of hiring discrimination. She cited the University of California 2030 Capacity Plan as having “precipitated unlawful action,” specifically employment practices that may have discriminated against “employees, job applicants and training program participants based on race and sex.”\n\n\nIn its strategic plan, the University of California says it is “committed to increasing the diversity of its faculty, both underrepresented minorities and female faculty.” The plan discusses efforts to diversify the faculty so that campuses better reflect the population of California, a goal partially rooted in helping populations who are less likely to graduate from college earn degrees.",

It awards grants that fund research fellowships, programs at museums and historic sites, website development and documentary filmmaking, among a host of other projects related to the public humanities. But it also disburses a great chunk of its appropriation — some $65 million of an annual budget of roughly $210 million — directly to nonprofit humanities councils in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and five territories.\n\n\nStaff cuts begin at NEH, threatening humanities programs across U.S.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2025/04/10/neh-staff-cuts-reduction-in-force/\n\nTrump Presents Harvard With an Ultimatum for Federal Funds\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/04/trump-sets-demands-harvard-must-meet-regain-federal\n\nThe ultimatum came just three days after the president’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism notified the university it had been placed under review for its alleged failure to protect Jewish students and faculty from discrimination. If the case follows the precedent set at other universities, Harvard and its affiliate medical institutions could lose up to $9 billion in federal grants and contracts if they do not comply.\n\n\nSources say the move is driven less by true concern about antisemitism on campus than by the government’s desire to abolish diversity efforts and hobble higher ed institutions it deems too “woke.” This week alone, the administration has retracted funds from Brown and Princeton Universities. Before that, it targeted the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University and opened dozens of civil rights investigations at other colleges, all of which are ongoing.\n\n(Also https://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-demands-harvard-eradicate-dei-to-preserve-its-federal-funding)\n\nNYTimes: Columbia’s Former Leader Faced Contentious Interview After Resigning\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/nyregion/columbia-president-armstrong-federal-deposition.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe hearing transcript provided an inside glimpse of the tension between Columbia and representatives of the Trump administration’s multiagency antisemitism task force, which is investigating at least 10 universities in an effort to root out what it sees as disturbing antisemitic activity on campuses.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Freezes $1 Billion for Cornell and $790 Million for Northwestern, Officials Say\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/cornell-northwestern-university-funds-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe moves are the latest and largest in a rapidly escalating campaign against elite American universities that has resulted in billions in federal funds being suspended or put under review in just over a month. Other schools that have had funds threatened include Brown, Columbia, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton.\n\n\nNorthwestern, a Big Ten university, is the first non-Ivy League school to have funding from the Trump administration targeted under investigations of alleged discrimination. The university issued a “progress report” last week that highlighted its efforts to protect Jewish students, including mandatory antisemitism training for all students, faculty and staff.\n\nAlso reported on here\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-team-to-freeze-nearly-2-billion-at-cornell-and-northwestern-universities-2e13a88a?st=BJbjFN&reflink=article_gmail_share\nand elsewhere\n\nNYTimes: Trump Has Targeted These Universities. Why?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nCritics of the administration have not hesitated to point out that all of those schools are in states — or, in George Washington’s case, a federal district — that voted for the Democratic ticket in 2024.\n\n\nThrough emails and social media, colleges discover federal funds are frozen\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/11/elite-colleges-trump-federal-funding-freeze-email/\n\nNSF, NIH Slash Support for Early-Career Scientists\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/10/nsf-nih-slash-support-early-career-scientists\n\nOn Tuesday, Nature reported the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program awarded 1,000 fellowships—fewer than half of the record-setting 2,555 fellowship offers it made in 2023, and the second-smallest number of awards since 2008.\n\n\nOver the past two weeks, the NIH has also canceled numerous institutional and individual training grants, including many that support scientists from underrepresented communities, according to The Transmitter.\n\n\nNIH Freezes Millions More in Funding for Columbia\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/09/nih-freezes-millions-more-funding-columbia\n\nBut after the university agreed to enact various reforms the Trump administration demanded to address alleged antisemitism on campus, it appeared a reprieve was in order. Education Secretary Linda McMahon said last month that she believed Columbia was “on the right track” toward final negotiations to unfreeze the research funds.\n\n\nInstead, the Trump administration has gone in the opposite direction, cutting off even more research funding. According to Science, the NIH froze Columbia’s funding Monday at the direction of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH is reportedly not only blocking new funding but also ceasing payments for work on existing projects. In addition, the agency will require prior approval to tap existing disbursements.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: When Trump Is Done, What Will Remain of Public Education?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/opinion/trump-k-12-education.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nA longer piece on the history of the DOE and education in US history\n\nAmerica’s story is one of progress, which has rarely been obtained simply through good will. It has to be enforced. Fights for equality have been messy, and quite bloody at times. Understanding that history is important so as not to repeat it. Still, shortly before leaving office in 2020, Mr. Trump established the President’s Advisory 1776 Commission, in part a rebuttal to the 1619 Project, as a way for the administration to write its own version of American history.\n\n\nThe president’s vision to take a sledgehammer to the Department of Education’s ability to function will cause student suffering. The founders believed that education was critical to the full experience of citizenship; it was where students learned arts, sciences, humanities and how to engage with one another. But putting that vision into place left the nation with a system where inequities — in content and classroom composition — were left in place.\n\n\nAmerica began to undo those inequities, and the department protected that progress. Now, less than three months into Mr. Trump’s second presidency, the administration has done everything in its power, and some things beyond its authority, to ensure we are equal no more.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump cancels dozens of international student visas at UC, Stanford - Los Angeles Times\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-05/trump-administration-cancels-international-student-visas-university-of-california-stanford\n\nAt UC San Diego, Chancellor Pradeep Khosla said in a campus message late Friday that five students had their visas revoked. He said the university received the notification “without warning.” Khosla said a sixth student was “detained at the border, denied entry and deported to their home country.”\n\n\nA University of California statement said that “several” campuses had students who lost their visa status but did not offer more details.\n\n\nTrump Admin Broadens Scope of Student Visa Terminations\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/04/08/trump-admin-broadens-scope-student-visa\n\nInside Higher Ed uncovered dozens of visa terminations that have not been reported elsewhere, many of them at regional public universities and small private colleges.\n\n\nCUNY is not immune\n\nThere are reports that over 20 CUNY students have had SEVIS visa issues (Student and Exchange Visitor Program)\nhttps://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/education/2025/04/09/department-of-homeland-security-revokes-student-visas-at-cuny-and-fordham–schools-say\nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/09/trump-administration-cancels-dozens-of-student-visas-at-nyu-cuny-other-ny-schools/\n\nTracking Trump’s Actions on Student Visas\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-actions-on-student-visas\n\nWith secret moves against international students, feds spread fear\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/09/international-student-visas-revoked-trump-deportation-fears/\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Displays More Aggressive Posture in Dealing With Demonstrators\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/nyregion/columbia-security-protesters-removed.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nA new, more assertive stance was on display on Wednesday, as the university’s officers intervened to stop a daylong demonstration of students, most of whom were Jewish, who had chained themselves to the campus’s wrought-iron gates.\n\n\nMoving to end the protest, public safety officers cut or untangled the students from their chains at about 11:15 p.m., and then physically picked them up before escorting them from campus. The officers carried at least one student off the lawn, according to video posted on social media and student interviews.\n\n\nHow conservatives are using Columbia as a ‘test case’ to enforce Trump’s agenda\n\nhttps://wapo.st/43EUxWX\nThis is an important analysis of the playbook being employed and it references what appears to be another Chris Rufo type.\n\nCritical of college admissions, diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and campus protests that he lambasted as pro-Hamas, Max Eden, then a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote an outline that presaged what was to come in the new Trump administration. He singled out Columbia as the top target.\n\n\n “To scare universities straight,” Eden wrote in the Washington Examiner [https://www.aei.org/op-eds/a-comprehensive-guide-to-overhauling-higher-education/] , Education Secretary Linda McMahon “should start by taking a prize scalp. She should simply destroy Columbia University.”\n\n\nOn the day the administration canceled the federal funding to the school, a senior Trump administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, described Columbia as a “test case” for using funding to pressure colleges to comply with Trump’s ideology.\n\n\n“We’re going to bankrupt these universities,” Leo Terrell, leader of the recently formed Justice Department task force on antisemitism, said on Fox News after the cuts to Columbia were announced.\n\n\n“They are targeting private institutions of education and attempting to police and control speech, political expression and thought. And that is truly unprecedented,” said Orion Danjuma, counsel at Protect Democracy, which is representing the unions alongside the law firm Altshuler Berzon. “Columbia is the testing ground for this. It’s a canary in the coal mine.”\n\n\nOther changes are not an exact match to the administration’s demands. The university is not abolishing its judicial board that oversees disciplinary cases as requested. But it will remove students from participating and give the provost oversight. It is not putting the Middle East, South Asian and African Studies department in academic receivership for five years as the administration wanted. That academic department will undergo a review by the provost’s office.\n\n\n“This was planned,” said Reinhold Martin, president of Columbia’s chapter of the AAUP. “We’ve seen the script. The assault on Columbia is going according to that script.”\n\nAs for the Eden piece here are his talking points:\n\nCutting Off Federal Funding – Columbia was, perhaps, the worst offender in indulging the pro-Hamas campus radicals. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights should initiate a compliance review of every single decision Columbia made. To do that, OCR would need the identities of every single foreign student who supported the protests, actions the Trump administration could deem material support of a terrorist organization. Border czar Tom Homan could then revoke every single one of the foreign protesting students’ visas. If Columbia doesn’t cooperate, McMahon could cut off its research grant funding.\n\n\nRemoving Foreign Money from Higher Education – And while the Trump administration is looking into Columbia, the Justice Department should thoroughly explore indicting former Columbia President Lee Bollinger for fraud if he, through commission or omission, played a role in Columbia’s submission of inaccurate data to US News and World Report. Bollinger submitted the data to boost Columbia’s rank in the report. Once the true data were reported, Columbia’s rank fell from second to 18th. College presidents regard Bollinger as perhaps the greatest college leader of the 21st century. He should be regarded as the worst. Perhaps the college presidents could learn a valuable lesson from the sight of him in an orange jumpsuit.\n\n\nThe second target should be the University of California, Los Angeles. UCLA’s …\n\n\nEnforcing Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard; he first step should be forcing Harvard University to comply. Right after the decision was issued, Harvard all but publicly vowed to do everything in its power to violate the spirit of the Supreme Court’s ruling and the 14th Amendment on which it was based. McMahon should initiate a never-ending compliance review to ensure that Harvard follows the law. … If OCR finds a shred of evidence of racial discrimination, Harvard should lose its Title IV funds. I\n\n\nAnd so many other universities have essentially forfeited the privilege of picking their own professors.\n\n\nThe University of Washington and UIC should be forced to pay back wages to every single white applicant they declined to hire over a DEI statement and hire as many as would still like to work there. … However, it could demand all documents and correspondence on hiring in every university faculty department that implemented DEI statements. It could then train an artificial intelligence model to sort through the records and flag likely discrimination. Trump staffers could then send internal, FOIA-able correspondence regarding hot spots of likely discrimination. … Enterprising trial attorneys could team up with starving adjunct professors, and universities could be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement fees. That would teach them a painful lesson: Hiring based on race rather than academic merit comes at a very high cost.\n\n\nHow Trump can Destroy DEI on Campus – it’s all stereotyping. DEI violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment when stereotyping is institutionalized and promoted in an educational institution receiving federal funding — or so the Trump administration should hold and enforce. … To assure compliance with the 14th Amendment, McMahon could task accreditors with ensuring that students aren’t forced to take DEI-infused courses to graduate. This would, essentially, take Florida’s policy of removing DEI from general education requirements national. When students aren’t forced to take these courses, far fewer will, and the radical Marxists will lose students and influence. … McMahon could also champion college students’ First Amendment rights by forcing colleges to dismantle their so-called “Bias Reporting Systems.” More than half of colleges encourage students to snitch on each other for saying something “biased,” and students suspected of wrong speak are then hauled in front of a campus tribunal of DEI administrators.\n\n\nShaking Up College Accreditation – Trump suggested he would simply fire all the existing accreditors. That could prove prohibitively difficult. But Trump could easily decimate the worst of them: the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. … Trump could also easily expedite the approval of additional accreditors. These accreditors could provide a much more streamlined, cost-effective, outcomes-oriented paradigm than the existing set. They could also specialize in helping to launch new colleges, such as the University of Austin, and even newer ones that no one has dreamed up yet. Musk University? Thiel Technical College?\n\n\nA New Kind of Public College What about the American Academy? Experts laughed when Trump proposed launching a new, federally backed college. But former President George Washington wanted one. … At absolute minimum, the American Academy could offer a two-year, high-quality core curriculum, and sympathetic states could mandate their flagship universities accept transfer credit. The Universities of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the like could hoover up students who might otherwise have spent far bigger bucks on a private university with a similar prestige level.\n\n\nThese are just some ideas, and they’re just mine. And, of course, there’s far more the next Trump Education Department should and can do — it just wouldn’t be prudent to broadcast those ideas ahead of time, lest universities take defensive measures.\n\n\nTrump Administration Wants to Install Federal Oversight of Columbia University - The Wall Street Journal. (Thanks KB)\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-consent-decree-trump-federal-funding-2f4c4690?st=nRCE68\n\nA consent decree would be a major escalation of how the federal government normally resolves education-related civil-rights issues. Typically after federal lawyers investigate and find evidence that civil rights were violated, schools enter voluntary agreements to change their practices. The federal government has little ability to enforce such agreements. The Biden administration entered into such voluntary agreements over antisemitism concerns with Brown University and Rutgers.\n\n\nColumbia could fight the move in court; the Justice Department would need to prove that the arrangement is warranted. But a court case could take years, and Columbia would likely lose federal funding in the interim—and might ultimately lose. Opposing the move would also open the school up to required depositions and legal fact-finding, which could keep the school’s campus politics in the spotlight.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: A Playbook for Standing Up to President Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/opinion/trump-law-firms-universities.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThese institutions do not have to capitulate to Mr. Trump. They have a realistic path to defeating his intimidation.\n\n\nYes, Mr. Trump has adopted a more extreme approach to executive power in his second term. He has won some early policy victories, and he will win more. Nonetheless, he faces real constraints on his power. Indeed, the most likely path to American autocracy depends on not only a power-hungry president but also the voluntary capitulation of a cowed civil society. It depends on the mistaken belief that a president is invincible. Anybody who has dealt with a schoolyard bully should recognize this principle: The illusion of invincibility is often his greatest asset.\n\n\nNYTimes: Obama Calls for Universities to Stand Up for Core Values\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/obama-trump-college-speech.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, in a campus speech on Thursday, urged universities to resist attacks from the federal government that violate their academic freedom.\n\n\nHe also said schools and students should engage in self-reflection about speech environments on their campuses.\n\n\nEisgruber signals that Princeton will not make concessions (Thanks KB)\n\nhttps://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/04/princeton-news-adpol-eisgruber-university-concessions-bloomberg-interview\n\n“We would look at ways to potentially reallocate endowment funding, which would involve very difficult choices, but at the end of the day, what would happen here and elsewhere is that less research would get done, and that would be a bad thing,” he said.\n\n\nEisgruber also emphasized the need for universities to act together in response to governmental funding cuts.\n\n\n“I think it’s important for universities to stand shoulder to shoulder as we go forward,” he said.\n\nSee also this podcast\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-university-president-willing-to-fight-trump/id1200361736?i=1000702847509\n(which was shared by MOO to the mailing list)\n\nNYTimes: New York Warns Trump It Will Not Comply With Public School D.E.I.

He has mobilized dozens of professors from across the country to track on his website criticalrace.org hundreds of social-justice statements, staff diversity trainings, and courses he says indoctrinate students with false ideas about American racism. His site has been cited more than 170 times by mainstream-media outlets.\n\n\nThe Legal Insurrection Foundation, Jacobson’s nonprofit, collected $1.2 million in revenue from donations and grants in 2023, according to tax filings. It’s not clear who has donated to his cause.\n\n\nThis past December, Jacobson filed a complaint to OCR against the University of Rhode Island for offering more than 31 scholarships exclusively given to minority students.

From Limiting Medical Research Funding\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/nih-medical-research-funding.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nJudge Kelley had consistently agreed, ruling repeatedly that the policy appeared unnecessarily reckless and would inflict serious harm on important medical research. After initially barring the Trump administration from implementing the change in February, she extended her order twice while the lawsuit played out.\n\n\nNYTimes: The N.E.H. Does What Republicans Always Wanted. DOGE Slashed It Anyway.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/opinion/humanities-cuts-tennessee-neh-doge.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe N.E.H. is one of the least-known of the federal agencies, but its work reaches a huge number of Americans, including those in Republican districts. It awards grants that fund research fellowships, programs at museums and historic sites, website development and documentary filmmaking, among a host of other projects related to the public humanities. But it also disburses a great chunk of its appropriation — some $65 million of an annual budget of roughly $210 million — directly to nonprofit humanities councils in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and five territories.\n\n\nStaff cuts begin at NEH, threatening humanities programs across U.S.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2025/04/10/neh-staff-cuts-reduction-in-force/\n\nTrump Presents Harvard With an Ultimatum for Federal Funds\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/04/trump-sets-demands-harvard-must-meet-regain-federal\n\nThe ultimatum came just three days after the president’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism notified the university it had been placed under review for its alleged failure to protect Jewish students and faculty from discrimination. If the case follows the precedent set at other universities, Harvard and its affiliate medical institutions could lose up to $9 billion in federal grants and contracts if they do not comply.\n\n\nSources say the move is driven less by true concern about antisemitism on campus than by the government’s desire to abolish diversity efforts and hobble higher ed institutions it deems too “woke.” This week alone, the administration has retracted funds from Brown and Princeton Universities. Before that, it targeted the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University and opened dozens of civil rights investigations at other colleges, all of which are ongoing.\n\n(Also https://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-demands-harvard-eradicate-dei-to-preserve-its-federal-funding)\n\nNYTimes: Columbia’s Former Leader Faced Contentious Interview After Resigning\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/nyregion/columbia-president-armstrong-federal-deposition.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe hearing transcript provided an inside glimpse of the tension between Columbia and representatives of the Trump administration’s multiagency antisemitism task force, which is investigating at least 10 universities in an effort to root out what it sees as disturbing antisemitic activity on campuses.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Freezes $1 Billion for Cornell and $790 Million for Northwestern, Officials Say\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/cornell-northwestern-university-funds-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe moves are the latest and largest in a rapidly escalating campaign against elite American universities that has resulted in billions in federal funds being suspended or put under review in just over a month. Other schools that have had funds threatened include Brown, Columbia, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton.\n\n\nNorthwestern, a Big Ten university, is the first non-Ivy League school to have funding from the Trump administration targeted under investigations of alleged discrimination. The university issued a “progress report” last week that highlighted its efforts to protect Jewish students, including mandatory antisemitism training for all students, faculty and staff.\n\nAlso reported on here\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-team-to-freeze-nearly-2-billion-at-cornell-and-northwestern-universities-2e13a88a?st=BJbjFN&reflink=article_gmail_share\nand elsewhere\n\nNYTimes: Trump Has Targeted These Universities. Why?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nCritics of the administration have not hesitated to point out that all of those schools are in states — or, in George Washington’s case, a federal district — that voted for the Democratic ticket in 2024.\n\n\nThrough emails and social media, colleges discover federal funds are frozen\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/11/elite-colleges-trump-federal-funding-freeze-email/\n\nNSF, NIH Slash Support for Early-Career Scientists\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/10/nsf-nih-slash-support-early-career-scientists\n\nOn Tuesday, Nature reported the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program awarded 1,000 fellowships—fewer than half of the record-setting 2,555 fellowship offers it made in 2023, and the second-smallest number of awards since 2008.\n\n\nOver the past two weeks, the NIH has also canceled numerous institutional and individual training grants, including many that support scientists from underrepresented communities, according to The Transmitter.\n\n\nNIH Freezes Millions More in Funding for Columbia\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/09/nih-freezes-millions-more-funding-columbia\n\nBut after the university agreed to enact various reforms the Trump administration demanded to address alleged antisemitism on campus, it appeared a reprieve was in order. Education Secretary Linda McMahon said last month that she believed Columbia was “on the right track” toward final negotiations to unfreeze the research funds.\n\n\nInstead, the Trump administration has gone in the opposite direction, cutting off even more research funding. According to Science, the NIH froze Columbia’s funding Monday at the direction of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH is reportedly not only blocking new funding but also ceasing payments for work on existing projects. In addition, the agency will require prior approval to tap existing disbursements.",

It has to be enforced. Fights for equality have been messy, and quite bloody at times. Understanding that history is important so as not to repeat it. Still, shortly before leaving office in 2020, Mr. Trump established the President’s Advisory 1776 Commission, in part a rebuttal to the 1619 Project, as a way for the administration to write its own version of American history.\n\n\nThe president’s vision to take a sledgehammer to the Department of Education’s ability to function will cause student suffering. The founders believed that education was critical to the full experience of citizenship; it was where students learned arts, sciences, humanities and how to engage with one another. But putting that vision into place left the nation with a system where inequities — in content and classroom composition — were left in place.\n\n\nAmerica began to undo those inequities, and the department protected that progress. Now, less than three months into Mr. Trump’s second presidency, the administration has done everything in its power, and some things beyond its authority, to ensure we are equal no more.",

The officers carried at least one student off the lawn, according to video posted on social media and student interviews.\n\n\nHow conservatives are using Columbia as a ‘test case’ to enforce Trump’s agenda\n\nhttps://wapo.st/43EUxWX\nThis is an important analysis of the playbook being employed and it references what appears to be another Chris Rufo type.\n\nCritical of college admissions, diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and campus protests that he lambasted as pro-Hamas, Max Eden, then a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote an outline that presaged what was to come in the new Trump administration. He singled out Columbia as the top target.\n\n\n “To scare universities straight,” Eden wrote in the Washington Examiner [https://www.aei.org/op-eds/a-comprehensive-guide-to-overhauling-higher-education/] , Education Secretary Linda McMahon “should start by taking a prize scalp. She should simply destroy Columbia University.”\n\n\nOn the day the administration canceled the federal funding to the school, a senior Trump administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, described Columbia as a “test case” for using funding to pressure colleges to comply with Trump’s ideology.\n\n\n“We’re going to bankrupt these universities,” Leo Terrell, leader of the recently formed Justice Department task force on antisemitism, said on Fox News after the cuts to Columbia were announced.\n\n\n“They are targeting private institutions of education and attempting to police and control speech, political expression and thought. And that is truly unprecedented,” said Orion Danjuma, counsel at Protect Democracy, which is representing the unions alongside the law firm Altshuler Berzon. “Columbia is the testing ground for this. It’s a canary in the coal mine.”\n\n\nOther changes are not an exact match to the administration’s demands. The university is not abolishing its judicial board that oversees disciplinary cases as requested. But it will remove students from participating and give the provost oversight. It is not putting the Middle East, South Asian and African Studies department in academic receivership for five years as the administration wanted. That academic department will undergo a review by the provost’s office.\n\n\n“This was planned,” said Reinhold Martin, president of Columbia’s chapter of the AAUP. “We’ve seen the script. The assault on Columbia is going according to that script.”\n\nAs for the Eden piece here are his talking points:\n\nCutting Off Federal Funding – Columbia was, perhaps, the worst offender in indulging the pro-Hamas campus radicals. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights should initiate a compliance review of every single decision Columbia made. To do that, OCR would need the identities of every single foreign student who supported the protests, actions the Trump administration could deem material support of a terrorist organization. Border czar Tom Homan could then revoke every single one of the foreign protesting students’ visas. If Columbia doesn’t cooperate, McMahon could cut off its research grant funding.\n\n\nRemoving Foreign Money from Higher Education – And while the Trump administration is looking into Columbia, the Justice Department should thoroughly explore indicting former Columbia President Lee Bollinger for fraud if he, through commission or omission, played a role in Columbia’s submission of inaccurate data to US News and World Report. Bollinger submitted the data to boost Columbia’s rank in the report. Once the true data were reported, Columbia’s rank fell from second to 18th. College presidents regard Bollinger as perhaps the greatest college leader of the 21st century. He should be regarded as the worst. Perhaps the college presidents could learn a valuable lesson from the sight of him in an orange jumpsuit.\n\n\nThe second target should be the University of California, Los Angeles. UCLA’s …\n\n\nEnforcing Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard; he first step should be forcing Harvard University to comply. Right after the decision was issued, Harvard all but publicly vowed to do everything in its power to violate the spirit of the Supreme Court’s ruling and the 14th Amendment on which it was based. McMahon should initiate a never-ending compliance review to ensure that Harvard follows the law. … If OCR finds a shred of evidence of racial discrimination, Harvard should lose its Title IV funds. I\n\n\nAnd so many other universities have essentially forfeited the privilege of picking their own professors.\n\n\nThe University of Washington and UIC should be forced to pay back wages to every single white applicant they declined to hire over a DEI statement and hire as many as would still like to work there. … However, it could demand all documents and correspondence on hiring in every university faculty department that implemented DEI statements. It could then train an artificial intelligence model to sort through the records and flag likely discrimination. Trump staffers could then send internal, FOIA-able correspondence regarding hot spots of likely discrimination. … Enterprising trial attorneys could team up with starving adjunct professors, and universities could be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement fees. That would teach them a painful lesson: Hiring based on race rather than academic merit comes at a very high cost.\n\n\nHow Trump can Destroy DEI on Campus – it’s all stereotyping. DEI violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment when stereotyping is institutionalized and promoted in an educational institution receiving federal funding — or so the Trump administration should hold and enforce. … To assure compliance with the 14th Amendment, McMahon could task accreditors with ensuring that students aren’t forced to take DEI-infused courses to graduate. This would, essentially, take Florida’s policy of removing DEI from general education requirements national. When students aren’t forced to take these courses, far fewer will, and the radical Marxists will lose students and influence. … McMahon could also champion college students’ First Amendment rights by forcing colleges to dismantle their so-called “Bias Reporting Systems.” More than half of colleges encourage students to snitch on each other for saying something “biased,” and students suspected of wrong speak are then hauled in front of a campus tribunal of DEI administrators.\n\n\nShaking Up College Accreditation – Trump suggested he would simply fire all the existing accreditors. That could prove prohibitively difficult. But Trump could easily decimate the worst of them: the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. … Trump could also easily expedite the approval of additional accreditors. These accreditors could provide a much more streamlined, cost-effective, outcomes-oriented paradigm than the existing set. They could also specialize in helping to launch new colleges, such as the University of Austin, and even newer ones that no one has dreamed up yet. Musk University? Thiel Technical College?\n\n\nA New Kind of Public College What about the American Academy? Experts laughed when Trump proposed launching a new, federally backed college. But former President George Washington wanted one. … At absolute minimum, the American Academy could offer a two-year, high-quality core curriculum, and sympathetic states could mandate their flagship universities accept transfer credit. The Universities of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the like could hoover up students who might otherwise have spent far bigger bucks on a private university with a similar prestige level.\n\n\nThese are just some ideas, and they’re just mine. And, of course, there’s far more the next Trump Education Department should and can do — it just wouldn’t be prudent to broadcast those ideas ahead of time, lest universities take defensive measures.\n\n\nTrump Administration Wants to Install Federal Oversight of Columbia University - The Wall Street Journal. (Thanks KB)\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-consent-decree-trump-federal-funding-2f4c4690?st=nRCE68\n\nA consent decree would be a major escalation of how the federal government normally resolves education-related civil-rights issues. Typically after federal lawyers investigate and find evidence that civil rights were violated, schools enter voluntary agreements to change their practices. The federal government has little ability to enforce such agreements. The Biden administration entered into such voluntary agreements over antisemitism concerns with Brown University and Rutgers.\n\n\nColumbia could fight the move in court; the Justice Department would need to prove that the arrangement is warranted. But a court case could take years, and Columbia would likely lose federal funding in the interim—and might ultimately lose. Opposing the move would also open the school up to required depositions and legal fact-finding, which could keep the school’s campus politics in the spotlight.",

He has mobilized dozens of professors from across the country to track on his website criticalrace.org hundreds of social-justice statements, staff diversity trainings, and courses he says indoctrinate students with false ideas about American racism. His site has been cited more than 170 times by mainstream-media outlets.\n\n\nThe Legal Insurrection Foundation, Jacobson’s nonprofit, collected $1.2 million in revenue from donations and grants in 2023, according to tax filings. It’s not clear who has donated to his cause.\n\n\nThis past December, Jacobson filed a complaint to OCR against the University of Rhode Island for offering more than 31 scholarships exclusively given to minority students. Mentioned in the complaint was the Miya Brophy-Baermann scholarship, which provides $1,500 to speech-language-pathology students who are racial minorities, men, or the first in their families to attend college.",

    "text": "Dear All,\nPlease find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.\nThanks to JC, VAC, BE, and IA for sharing links and thoughts.\n\n\n(The testimony in front of the House Committee on Education & Workforce seems not to have dealt any serious blows to any of the three leaders, including CUNY’s Chancellor – Stefanik’s predictable demand that he be fired has not been amplified, save for in the Times of India. The rope-a-dope style where responses fall back on policies and carrying them out while admitting individual tweets or comments may be reprehensible might be smart politics, but leaves a sour taste. The rope-a-dope is meant to tire people out for a counter attack, and the latter wasn’t the intent. I felt there were more than a few missed opportunities:\nI thought Stefanik’s questioning on Abda had such a faulty premise – she had worked at CAIR so shouldn’t be employable – needed some push back. There was not a hint of suggestion that her work for CUNY has been problematic or compromised, yet people should be fired. Plus, the NYT reported her characterization of CAIR is wholly unfounded.\nHer question about CUNY clear was so poorly framed as to require a reprimand by the ranking member in his closing – people accused deserve representation and the egregious examples of this particular case are so bad something could have been said beyond they choose their own cases.\nThe Hunter College questions involved showing someone’s email–doxxing–and was essentially a call for punishment for involving the police in a police matter. [thanks EI]\nThe questions about Jewish Faculty being represented by the PSC from one congressman who tried to get the Chancellor to admit it was unfair could have had much more pushback – this case was appealed to the supreme court which declined to hear it. Basically this congressman was asking the Chancellor to go against several judge’s opinions. Maybe pointing that out shows the ridiculousness of this and other questions.\nThe PSC positions were mis-characterized; the PSC Chair was personally dragged and mis-characterized–the rope-a-dope that the union is an independent group could have been turned into a counterattack to the assault on faculty unions in general.\nIf any good came out of this, hopefully it will be the republican majority realizing these hearings have totally lost their potency. Maybe the reporting next time will pick up the consistent message of the democrats that these aren’t seriously trying to understand a problem.)\n\n3 College Presidents Went to Congress. Here’s What They Talked About.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/3-college-presidents-went-to-congress-heres-what-they-talked-about\n(Thanks BE for summarizing these links, VAC for sharing)\n\nThe congressional hearings don’t appear to pack as much punch as they once did, when it felt like college presidents’ jobs were on the line.\n\n\nThe Trump administration’s campaign is like The Wizard of Oz, he [Nosanchuk, former civil-rights official] said, because it’s “projecting an intimidating, demanding, and illusory image of action, but here the man behind the curtain cancels funds for civil-rights enforcement and cancer research.”\n\n\nRep. Virginia Foxx, a Republican of North Carolina, mentioned the fact that the influential union has passed multiple BDS resolutions, and that it has been found responsible for discrimination against a Jewish faculty member by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the president of the PSC, James C. Davis, slammed Republicans’ “attempt to smear CUNY and our union as antisemitic.”\n\n\n“We do not accept the false premise that underlies today’s hearing that any campus activism in support of the Palestinian people is antisemitic, if not criminal,” Davis wrote. “As a union, we do not have a position on BDS and do not have Israel divestment policies.”\n\n\n3 More Campus Leaders Face Congress\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/16/3-more-campus-leaders-face-congress\n\nFor the fifth time since late 2023, congressional Republicans on Tuesday interrogated a group of university leaders about campus antisemitism. But unlike previous hearings, this one was short on fireworks and viral moments\n\n\nHouse Republicans Grill CUNY Chief on Campus Antisemitism Claims\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/07/15/cuny-felix-matos-rodriguez-antisemitism-house-elise-stefanik/\n(Grill was the headline choice of many others, mostly the slanted right side of reporting)\n\nSome of the toughest questioning of Matos Rodríguez again came from Stefanik, an ally of President Donald Trump who is reportedly considering a run for governor in New York after the president withdrew her nomination to be U.N. Ambassador to protect Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\n\nPSC president Davis then went on to decry what he saw as a clamp down on free speech across the university campuses.\n\n\n“CUNY administrators have investigated faculty for the terms in which they discuss the war in Gaza in their classes, limited the time, place, and manner for exercising the right to free expression on campus, invited police violence against non-violent student protestors, and even fired faculty in apparent retribution for their political activism,” Davis said. “It is still not enough to satisfy the new McCarthyites. Universities must stand against fascism, not accommodate it.”\n\n\nNYTimes: University Leaders Reject Republican Attacks on Campus Antisemitism\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/us/politics/antisemitism-hearing-uc-berkeley-georgetown-cuny.html\n\nOn Tuesday, Republicans accused the university leaders of fostering an antisemitic climate and failing to rein in professors and students the lawmakers said were antisemitic. Democrats on the committee argued the hearing was part of a crackdown on speech that attempted to scapegoat academia for a broader societal problem.\n\n\nThe university leaders, meanwhile, seemed to have learned from the past. They attempted, with apparent success, to avoid the kinds of viral moments that have characterized previous antisemitism hearings and brought down other university presidents.\n\n\nShe [Stefanik] attacked CUNY for hiring a former employee of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights organization, inaccurately suggesting that CAIR had been a “co-conspirator in a terrorist financing case.” (The group was listed as an “unindicted co-conspirator or joint venturer” in a case against a charity, the Holy Land Foundation, along with more than 200 other groups and individuals. It was not accused of a crime.)\n\n\nResponding to Ms. Stefanik’s attacks on Tuesday, CAIR’s national deputy director, Edward Ahmed Mitchell, said the “spirit of Joseph McCarthy is alive and well.” “Representing Mahmoud Khalil and others targeted by the government because they advocated for Palestinian rights is not only our prerogative as lawyers at CLEAR,” said Mr. Kassem, the CUNY law professor who founded the legal clinic, “it is also our pride and privilege.”\n\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik skewers CUNY chancellor, calls for his ouster over ‘failed’ leadership on NYC campus antisemitism\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2025/07/15/us-news/rep-elise-stefanik-skewers-cuny-chancellor-calls-for-his-ouster-over-failed-leadership-on-nyc-campus-antisemitism/\n(Cuz why? don’t ask – CUNY hired someone she didn’t like who in several years has no complaints mentioned about her work; lawyers represent people before they are proven not guilty or guilty?)\n\nThe Republican congresswoman zeroed in on Chancellor Félix Matos Rodríguez over the hiring of a chief diversity officer who previously worked for a pro-Hamas, Israel-bashing group — saying that if the CUNY boss doesn’t step down, Gov. Kathy Hochul should bounce him.\n\n\nStefanik also asked Matos Rodríguez if he knew that law professor Ramzi Kassem, the head of CUNY Law School’s legal clinic, Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility or CLEAR, was representing Mahmoud Khalil, the anti-Israel Columbia University protester who was detained by the Trump administration.\n\n\nIn a joint press conference after the hearing with Brooklyn Councilwoman Inna Vernikov in DC, Stefanik said Matos Rodríguez had to go, and claimed Hochul was part of the problem.\n\n(Just testing their powers; doubt either was packing today, but can’t vouch for that on other days.)\n(And what is wrong with the Post? In several hours of testimony they couldn’t find one unflattering photo?)\n\nConservatives Denounce Professor for ‘Symbolic Strike’ Post\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/07/18/republicans-denounce-georgetown-professor-post-iran\n\nOn June 22, the United States bombed Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities. Observers wondered whether it was the start of another lengthy, destructive American war in the Middle East.\n\n\nHours later, a conservative social media account with more than 4.3 million followers highlighted one response—allegedly from a Georgetown University professor. According to a screenshot the Libs of TikTok X account posted, Jonathan Brown, the Alwaleed bin Talal Chair of Islamic Civilization, had written on X, “I hope Iran does some symbolic strike on a base, then everyone stops.”\n\n\nWhat transpired is becoming a familiar story in U.S. higher education: Conservatives denounce a faculty member’s speech, members of Congress join in and eventually pressure a prestigious university’s president to publicly denounce and punish the scholar.\n\n\nGreg Afinogenov, an associate history professor and president of Georgetown’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said Brown has received “death threats, his family has come under attack and members of the university administration have also criticized him and disavowed him.”\n\n\nAfinogenov said the university should clarify that Brown’s post was “protected speech.”\n\n\n“This procedure of hauling members of university administrations before” a “congressional kangaroo court” harms academic freedom, he said. Administrators should push back against these “smear campaigns,” and Georgetown should articulate a policy to protect faculty and other members of the university community from retaliation for their “extramural speech,” such as on social media, he said.\n\n\nCongress attacked CUNY on falsehoods\n\nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/18/congress-attacked-cuny-on-falsehoods/\n(PSC Chair has this op-ed)\n\nPlease, provide an email to continue reading this article for free. [Sadly]\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Trump’s Bombast Reveals About His Vision for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/15/how-public-attacks-harvard-harm-all-higher-ed\n\nQ: Do you think the administration has a vision for higher education in particular?\n\n\nA: I think it’s a vision for America, and Trump has been remarkably clear on what that looks like. It’s an America defined pretty narrowly on racial, ethnic and religious terms. It’s an America that has a certain understanding of its history that aligns with those dominant religious, racial and ethnic groups. It’s an America that has doubled down on masculinity as its defining gender in terms of who should be in power and have power in public life. So when we talk about a vision for higher ed, it’s a higher ed that serves that.\n\n\nThis is what you see in these very vague pronouncements about things like DEI. Anyone who educates or does research on anything that runs counter to that celebration of a very particularistic America is suspect and un-American. Higher ed is part of a whole set of knowledge-producing institutions in society—we can think about journalists and scientists, too— as being problematic because they serve accountability functions. They hold corporations responsible for things like polluting. They hold executives responsible for violations of democratic norms. Or, you know, they hold people in power accountable for not being good custodians of public trust. I think the administration wants to weaken that accountability function that can be played by universities because it undermines, ultimately, their ability to exercise power in the service of that larger vision of what they believe America should be.\n\n\nQ: You mentioned vague pronouncements about things like DEI. What conclusions do you draw from this tactic of sowing confusion and using unclear and undefined language?\n\n\nA: Ultimately, the end goal is control. They have a few tools to do so—legal means, regulatory means—and they have a lot of funding means to get institutions that are otherwise autonomous in civil society to comply with what they want them to do. But in the absence of those levers, what do you use? Well, you use publicity to get willing compliance or anticipatory compliance.\n\n\nWhy Universities Are So Powerless in Their Fight Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/why-universities-are-so-powerless-in-their-fight-against-trump\n\nThe administration’s moves to slash federal funding are just one part of a concerted effort to force major research universities to change how they pursue their core missions. And yet the sector’s most full-throated response — an American Association of Colleges and Universities statement signed by over 600 academic leaders — makes only vague reference to “constructive reform” while rejecting coercive uses of public funding. Widely adopted faculty resolutions calling for mutual-defense pacts amount to little more than suggestions that have yet to bear fruit. The most successful instances of collective resistance to date are four lawsuits challenging agency indirect-cost policies. By my count, 23 universities have joined at least one of those suits.\n\n\nA decentralized organizational structure puts resources and decision-making authority nearer to the ground, allowing different units of the university to prioritize the things their work requires. Faculties in business, social work, or law can make curricular, hiring, and promotion decisions largely independent of each other and of colleagues in arts and sciences, each tuning their activities to their specific needs, goals, and vision. Decentralization also explains why universities rarely articulate detailed, actionable principles that unequivocally guide institutionwide decision-making — or at least why, when they do proffer strategic plans or mission statements, the results are often anodyne.\n\n\nUniversities are organized to hold contradictions, not to resolve them. Typical academic decision-making processes manage the ambiguities that multiple goals create in lieu of picking winners in the underlying conflicts. That works well in normal times, but it is disastrously bad for reaching, communicating, and acting on common priorities under threat. Yet universities’ public missions may now require them to do just that.\n\n\nProminent conservatives generally agree that hardball tactics are necessary to compel desired changes in academe. JD Vance advocated for “honestly and aggressively” attacking universities. Leo Terrell, who heads the Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, wants financial pressures “to bring these universities to their knees.” As the conservative commentator Heather Mac Donald puts it: “The concept of academic freedom should be scaled back to allow funders — especially taxpayers — a say in how universities are run, including in what is taught.” The activist Christopher F. Rufo believes “existential terror” will provide the leverage needed to make an ultimatum stick: “Reform, or lose billions in funding.” That threat is now being carried out, and the administration’s will to back it up has been on clear display. As Robert Kelchen put it, “Every revenue source is at risk.” Federal research grants and contracts are just the beginning.\n\n\nThe Columbia example shows that the decisions institutions targeted by the Trump administration face have far-reaching, complex implications that take them far outside the standard mechanisms of academic leadership. The most easily defensible choice for any institution may be to protect its interests by negotiating for the best individual deal. But, as one Harvard professor pointed out, “that might be quite bad for higher education as a whole.”\n\n\nThe Harvard case has, so far, revealed this administration’s willingness to flip every policy lever available to them to reshape universities. It suggests a more complex landscape and more wrenching decisions are in store — choices that will certainly pit a university against itself, further fragmenting and undermining coordinated responses.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Winning the Race to the Bottom\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/opinion/trump-america-china.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nPopulists are anti-intellectual. President Trump isn’t pumping research money into the universities; he’s draining it out. The administration is not tripling the National Science Foundation’s budget; it’s trying to gut it. The administration is trying to cut all federal basic research funding by a third, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. A survey by the journal Nature of 1,600 scientists in the United States found that three-quarters of them have considered leaving the country.\n\n\nAmerica’s leaders understood that a superpower rivalry is as much an intellectual contest as a military and economic one. It’s who can out-innovate whom. So they fought the Soviet threat with education, with the goal of maximizing talent on our side.\n\n\n“One reason the U.S. economy had such a good Cold War was that the American university had an ever better one,” the historian Hal Brands writes in his book “The Twilight Struggle.” Federal support for academic research rose to $1.45 billion in 1970 from $254 million in 1958. Earlier in that century, American universities lagged behind their “best” European peers, Brands observes; by the end of the Cold War, they dominated the globe.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Report on the State of Academic Governance in Community Colleges\n\n(Thanks to JC and VAC)\nhttps://www.aaup.org/news/new-report-state-academic-governance-community-colleges\n\nAt most responding institutions, and especially at responding institutions with tenure systems, faculty authority is consistent with AAUP-recommended governance standards in decision-making about programmatic, departmental, and institutional curricula; teaching assignments; salary policies; and faculty searches, evaluations, and tenure and promotion standards.\n\n\nHowever, in several decision-making areas, including budgets, buildings, provost selection, and strategic planning, community college faculty have few meaningful opportunities to participate. In these areas, community colleges deviate from the principles set forth in the AAUP’s 1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities, which emphasizes faculty involvement in personnel decisions and budget preparation.\n\n\nStatistically significant differences in the level of faculty authority between unionized and nonunionized colleges appear in only three of the twenty-six areas, a finding that mirrors that in the AAUP’s 2021 Shared Governance Survey of four-year institutions. Specifically, institutions where the faculty engages in collective bargaining have higher levels of faculty authority in areas related to salary policies teaching loads, and, in the case of community colleges, full-time non-tenure-track faculty promotion decisions.\n\n\nAcross most areas of academic and personnel decision-making, levels of faculty authority are lower at community colleges than at four-year institutions. However, faculty members at community colleges have more involvement in salary policies than those at four-year institutions; the difference is likely related to the higher prevalence of institutions with collective bargaining in the community college sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas just gutted free speech on college campuses. Is your state next?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/07/14/texas-campus-free-speech/\n\nAcross the country, state legislators have been racing to exert new influence over free expression in higher education. Now, Texas has surged to the forefront, closing its 2025 legislative session by passing two alarming laws that take effect Sept. 1.\n\n\nthe new laws amount to a stunningly aggressive legislative crackdown on campus protest (S.B. 2972) and academic shared governance (S.B. 37) at public colleges and universities. The laws will not just silence dissent and undermine faculty authority in Texas; they provide a blueprint for how to dismantle academic freedom and chill speech on campus state by state.\n\n\nNow, some of the same legislators have done an about-face. The campus protest law actually directs public colleges and universities to implement a version of free-speech zones and adopt sweeping limitations on protests. Encampments? Banned. Megaphones or speakers during “class hours”? Forbidden — if anyone claims your “expressive activity” is one that “intimidates others” or “interferes” with an employee’s duties. Even wearing a mask during a protest — something many do for safety — could land a student or employee a disciplinary hearing resulting in “sanctions.” And any expressive activity between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. is off-limits altogether.\n\n\nState law defines “expressive activity” as “any speech or expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment” — speeches, writing, art, symbolic actions, even just talking to your friends. It’s problematic enough that legislators seek to prohibit nighttime or early-morning protest activity, but the language could affect late-night art events, student journalists, and even assigned research, course or thesis work for students or faculty in the habit of burning the midnight oil. The new law is so absurdly broad it could theoretically be used to stop a group of students from discussing politics on a campus bench at night. That’s not security; it’s suppression.\n\n\nAnd this is just half the story.\n\n\nThe second new law in Texas is an outright power grab dismantling shared governance, the cornerstone of U.S. higher education. Typically, higher education institutions have democratic systems to share power and foster collaboration among administrators, governing boards and faculty. Faculty senates, whose members are typically elected by faculty, exercise authority over curricular matters, academic policies and graduation requirements. In addition, they often play a role in general institutional decisions, such as related to planning, budgeting or the evaluation of administrators.\n\n\nThe Texas legislature obliterates these traditions, stripping faculty of any meaningful decision-making role in how their institutions are run. Under this law, faculty senates at public universities and colleges can now exist only if permitted by the institutions’ governing boards — the oversight bodies whose members are politically appointed by the state governor. In mockery of democratic principles, half of the faculty senate members must be chosen by the university president, and administrators can remove faculty for not conducting their duties within vague “senate parameters.”\n\n\nTo make matters worse, the law installs a governor-appointed “ombudsman” with sweeping enforcement powers. This political appointee will be charged with monitoring compliance with state laws and can recommend that a public university or college lose all state funding unless it complies.\n\n\n\n\nTech billionaire Trump adviser Marc Andreesen says universities will ‘pay the price’ for DEI\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/07/12/marc-andreessen-private-chat-universities-diversity/\n\nThe investor described a “counterattack” against universities in his messages and called for the National Science Foundation, a federal research funding agency, to receive “the bureaucratic death penalty.”\n\n\n“The universities are at Ground Zero of the counterattack” from Trump voters, Andreessen wrote, alleging colleges favored immigrants over Americans and promoted DEI, or diversity, equity, and inclusion policies intended to increase race and gender representation.\n\n\n“The combination of DEI and immigration is politically lethal,” Andreessen wrote. “When these two forms of discrimination combine, as they have for the last 60 years and on hyperdrive for the last decade, they systematically cut most of the children of the Trump voter base out of any realistic prospect of access to higher education and corporate America.”\n\n(Yeah, right)\n\n\nNYTimes: Inside the Conservative Campaign That Took Down the U.Va. President\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/us/politics/university-virginia-president-trump-dei-jefferson-council.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFor years, the group [The Jefferson Council] had railed against the university’s president, James E. Ryan, for his robust promotion of campus diversity initiatives.\n\n\nThe Justice Department then hired a lawyer to help enforce those orders at the Office of Civil Rights: Gregory W. Brown, a University of Virginia alumnus and donor.\n\n\nThe Jefferson Council and the Office of Civil Rights separately denied in interviews that they had worked in concert. But the council had at least set the table for what came next. And in his new position, Mr. Brown helped engineer an unusual and concerted pressure campaign that would lead to Mr. Ryan’s resignation.\n\n\nAnd in his new position, Mr. Brown helped engineer an unusual and concerted pressure campaign that would lead to Mr. Ryan’s resignation.\n\n\nThat campaign showed just how far the Office of Civil Rights — which had for decades been at the center of the fight for racial equality — would go to take on universities that it views as hostile to its new agenda. By issuing a stream of demands and threats, the office essentially sped past the university board, appointed by the governor, that has oversight of its flagship public university.\n\n\n“What the Justice Department did was very similar to what President Eisenhower did,” Mr. Gardner [the Jefferson Council president] said, comparing the Trump administration’s actions to the 1957 White House decision to dispatch troops to Little Rock, Ark., to enforce the Supreme Court’s school desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education.\n\n(Uhh…)\n\nThere were other requests [In addition to the 7 letters]. The New York Times reported that the Trump administration had privately demanded Mr. Ryan’s ouster to help resolve its investigation into the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, according to three people briefed on the matter.\n\n\nMs. Dhillon, in an interview with the Times, denied that her office had pressured the university to remove its president.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState Department official defends canceling visas of pro-Palestinian academics - POLITICO\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/11/state-official-testimony-trump-deportations-00449634\n\nArmstrong insisted that no visas were revoked based on “protected speech,” but when asked if visas were sometimes pulled due to students’ “political viewpoints,” he gave a more complex answer.\n\n\nFormer Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil’s visa was canceled due to his “role in antisemitic protests and disruptive activities that foster a hostile environment towards Jewish students in the United States,\n\n\nformer Columbia student, Mohsen Mahdawi, was “involved in leadership of disruptive protests at Columbia University that included antisemitic conduct and calling for the destruction of Israel,”\n\n\nTufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk had her visa revoked as a result of “her antisemitic activities in the U.S.” and for “creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization,”\n\n(See also)\nhttps://knightcolumbia.org/cases/aaup-v-rubio\n\n\n\n\nHigher-Ed Associations Pitch an Alternative to Trump’s Cap on Research Funding\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/higher-ed-associations-pitch-an-alternative-to-trumps-cap-on-research-funding\n\nThe Joint Associations Group, or JAG, which includes the Association of American Universities (AAU), the American Council on Education (ACE), and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), announced its proposal on Friday. The coalition sees its plan as a middle ground, one that responds to long-held gripes about how indirect costs are administered while lessening the billions in lost revenue for universities under the 15-percent indirect-cost cap proposed by several federal agencies, among them the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Departments of Defense and Energy.\n\n\nThe plan’s true effect on how much universities would receive for indirect costs is unclear.

Holden Thorp, editor in chief of the Science family of journals and a former university chancellor, who is not part of JAG but has reviewed the proposal, said such a fundamental change to how universities balance their research budgets will be costly. The amount of funding received under the FAIR model “absolutely will be less,” he said, but “it won’t be as bad as it was going to be” under the Trump administration’s proposed 15-percent cap.\n\n\n\n\nHouse Appropriators Propose 23% Cut to NSF\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/15/house-appropriators-propose-23-cut-nsf\n\nHouse Republicans want to cut the National Science Foundation’s funding by about $2 billion, according to budget documents released Monday.\n\n\nStill, funding for NSF is already one point of disagreement between House and Senate appropriators. Last week, Senate Republicans indicated that they would cut only about $16 million from NSF, leaving the agency with just over $9 billion.\n\n\nThe House plan, which would give NSF about $7 billion, is just a proposal and doesn’t go as far as President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026, which cuts more than $5 billion from the agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Live Updates: Supreme Court Clears Way for Dismantling of Education Department\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/07/14/us/trump-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe order is a significant victory for the administration and could ease President Trump’s efforts to sharply curtail the federal government’s role in the nation’s schools.\n\n\nIt also represents an expansion of presidential power, allowing Mr. Trump to functionally eliminate a government department created by Congress, without legislators’ input.\n\n\nIt comes after a decision by the justices last week that cleared the way for the Trump administration to move forward with cutting thousands of jobs across a number of federal agencies, including the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, State and Treasury.\n\n\nThe order by the court was unsigned and gave no reasoning, as is typical in such emergency applications. No vote count was given, which is usual for emergency orders, but Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissent, joined by the court’s other two liberals, Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\n\nThe order is technically temporary, applying while appeals proceed through the courts. In practice, thousands of fired workers whom a Boston judge had ordered be reinstated are now again subject to removal from their jobs.\n\n(Sotamayor)\n\nThe President must take care that the laws are faithfully executed, not set out to dismantle them. That basic rule undergirds our Constitution’s separation of powers. Yet today, the majority rewards clear defiance of that core principle with emergency relief.

Here’s a guide to what is changing.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/trump-student-loans-tax-spending-bill-9dfc96eb?st=PG4sQs&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\n\n\n\nLegislatures Require Colleges to Cut Degrees in Low Demand\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/state-policy/2025/07/15/latest-legislative-directives-cut-degrees-low-demand\n\nBut at least three Republican-dominated states—Indiana, Ohio and Utah—passed specific laws this year that push institutions to eliminate degree programs that graduate few students. In a similar vein, Texas passed a law going after academic minors and certificate programs with low enrollments. It worries faculty and scholarly groups, who stress that the number of majors in a program isn’t the only or best way to gauge its worth.\n\n\n“Campuses are forced to respond to legislative mandates that have arisen from a narrow understanding of what higher education is,” said Paula Krebs, executive director of the Modern Language Association. Students who pursue public higher education will be “getting a reduced version of what a degree should be,” she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: How Trump’s crackdown on universities is affecting the world\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/07/13/us/2025-06-06-int-science-reaction-index.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUniversities are an easy target for right-wing populists. Polls show that a lot of Americans consider them too liberal, too expensive and too elitist, and not entirely without reason.\n\n(Why the lede needs to add that last bit is beyond me…)\n\nToday, the biggest beneficiary could be China and Chinese universities, which have been trying to recruit world-class scientific talent for years. Now Mr. Trump is doing their work for them. One indication of the success of China’s campaign to attract the best and brightest is Africa, the world’s youngest continent. Africans are learning Mandarin in growing numbers. Nearly twice as many study in China as in America.\n\n\nCould America gamble away its scientific supremacy in the service of ideology? It has happened before. Under the Nazis, Germany lost its scientific edge to America in the space of a few years. As a German, my brain may wander too readily to the lessons of the 1930s, but in this case the analogy feels instructive. Several of my colleagues covering the fallout from the crackdown on international students and researchers pointed to Hitler’s silencing of scientists and intellectuals.\n\n\nI don’t sense a big change in the mood in India yet. The United States still holds a lot of soft power and remains very attractive to Indians. In fact, many Indians are seeing something that is pretty familiar to them. They’re saying, “Welcome to the world as we have experienced it for the past few years.” The government under Narendra Modi has definitely cracked down on free speech. It has tried to quash dissenting voices, and it has also leaned on academics and has tried to squeeze certain research institutions that it considers too liberal. And there has been a demonization of the Muslim minority, which make up about 15 percent of the population. There are a lot of similarities to Trump’s America. Everyone in the world is just trying to understand what Trump’s actions mean for their own countries. So India’s experience can be instructive in making sense of this moment. [Anupreeta Das is a South Asia correspondent for the Times,]\n\n\nChina really wants to become a center for international education, because it sees that as a key ingredient for building its reputation as a global superpower. American universities have long been a source of American soft power. China wants Chinese universities to be a source of Chinese soft power. And now Trump is doing their work for them. You can see that in China’s rhetoric and messaging. It’s trying to portray itself as open and international, everything that the Trump administration is turning away from. [Vivian Wang is a correspondent for the Times in Beijing]\n\n\n\n\nTrump wields his ‘secret weapon’: College accreditation\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/12/trump-college-accreditation-political-influence/\n(“his” What about just saying weaponizing …)\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his allies are using a little-known but powerful corner of higher education — college accreditation — to exert pressure on colleges and universities, an effort that threatens the independence of accreditors and the stability of the institutions they approve.\n\n\nThis week, the Education and Health and Human Services departments encouraged Harvard University’s accreditor to take action against the Ivy League school for allegedly violating the civil rights of Jewish students. The New England Commission of Higher Education, which accredits Harvard, said it has given the university until Aug. 15 to respond and will take up the matter at a previously scheduled meeting in September.\n\n\nThe administration took a similar step in early June over Columbia University’s alleged civil rights violations. By the end of June, Columbia’s accreditor, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, issued the school a noncompliance warning. Middle States did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n“It’s unusual for [the Office of Civil Rights] to directly involve itself in accrediting matters,” said John R. Przypyszny, a lawyer who specializes in accreditation.\n\n\nWhile the Trump administration has no direct control over whether the schools remain accredited, it could punish accreditors for failing to act by stripping them of the authority needed to operate. And a recent move by the Education Department is raising questions about whether the administration is dangling that possibility over Harvard and Columbia’s accreditors.\n\n\nA day after notifying Columbia’s accreditor of the Ivy League school’s alleged violations in June, the Education Department postponed a meeting of the federal advisory committee that oversees accreditors from July to October. The 18-member committee was scheduled to vote this summer on whether Middle States and the New England Commission should remain certified to accredit colleges.\n\n\nBy the time the committee meets this fall, the terms of six of its members will have expired. The House, Senate and education secretary take turns appointing members, and this time the secretary will fill all six seats. That gives the Trump administration a chance to select people who are aligned with its ideology on higher education.\n\n\n“It seems like they’re trying to fix the vote,” said Robert Shireman, a member of the committee who is also a senior fellow at the left-leaning Century Foundation.\n\n\nSeveral committee members said the Education Department flouted the rules of the panel, which says only the chair can set a meeting schedule. When Zakiya Smith Ellis, who assumed the role of chair in February, pointed that out, she said the department told her it did not recognize her as chair because she took over the position when the previous chair resigned.\n\n\nDespite Reservations, Florida Approves New Accreditor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/state-policy/2025/07/11/despite-reservations-florida-bog-approves-new-accreditor\n\nThe decision came after about an hour of heated discussion between board members and the State University System of Florida’s chancellor regarding details of the plan.\n\n\nChancellor Raymond Rodriguez argued that the new accreditor, called the Commission for Public Higher Education, would eliminate the bureaucracy that comes with existing accrediting agencies and focus specifically on the needs of public universities.\n\n\n“The Commission for Public Higher Education will offer an accreditation model that prioritizes academic excellence and student success while removing ideological bias and unnecessary financial burdens,” he said. “Through the CPHE, public colleges and universities across the country will have access to an accreditation process that is focused on quality, rooted in accountability and committed to continuous improvement.”\n\n\nBut before voting in favor of the motion, board members repeatedly pushed back, arguing that the plans for starting an accreditor from scratch were half-baked.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: As Harvard and Trump Head to Court, the Government Piles on the Pressure\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/us/harvard-trump-head-to-trial.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement served subpoenas to Harvard with sprawling demands that included payroll records, years of disciplinary files and any videos Harvard had of international students protesting on campus since 2020, according to two people familiar with the subpoenas, some of which were reviewed by The New York Times. The agency gave the university a breakneck one-week deadline for compliance.\n\n\nAlso this month, the administration formally accused the school of civil rights violations, arguing that Harvard had failed to protect Jewish people on campus. The government also complained to the university’s accreditor, which could eventually jeopardize Harvard students’ access to federal financial aid.\n\n\nHarvard leaders are well aware that a long fight with the government is perilous, threatening jobs, projects, reputations and academic independence. Some inside the university have feared that civil inquiries could become criminal matters.\n\n\nBefore the lawsuit, the administration sent Harvard an extraordinary list of conditions, including new policies on hiring, admissions and faculty influence, compulsory reports to the government and audits of academic programs and departments. Since then, although officials acknowledged that sending the letter was a mistake, the government has barely budged from the demands.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia and Trump Near a Deal, With School Possibly Paying Millions\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/11/nyregion/columbia-university-trump-deal-antisemitism.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe existence of a potential deal was confirmed by a third person, who, like the others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive negotiations.\n\n(Methinks this may be a planted story to put pressure on Columbia, but what do I know.)\n\nA university spokeswoman on Friday night did not confirm details of the deal or the potential White House meeting. “The university is focused on advancing the discussions with the federal government. There is no resolution at this time,” the spokeswoman, Virginia Lam Abrams, said.\n\n\nThe deal could include $200 million or more in compensation paid by Columbia for alleged civil rights violations. Columbia officials are expected to meet with Trump aides next week at the White House to finalize the deal, said one of the people familiar with the discussions.\n\n\nAnd Harvard, despite its litigation, has also restarted talks with the Trump administration regarding the return of billions of dollars in federal research funding that have been cut.\n\n\nThe current draft of the deal, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and The Free Beacon, does not go as far in exerting federal authority over the university as an earlier version that was circulated in April.\n\n\nThe negotiations with Columbia have been directed out of the White House by a team led by a Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, with additional involvement of an interagency task force on antisemitism.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-columbia-civil-rights-settlement-86f64531\nhttps://freebeacon.com/campus/columbia-nears-deal-with-trump-administration-university-will-pay-discrimination-victims-reveal-more-admissions-and-hiring-data-but-will-dodge-harsher-measures-like-governance-shakeup/\n(From Wikipedia “The New York Times credited the Free Beacon with breaking, together with Chris Rufo,[23] and subsequently expanding, reportage on the plagiarism accusations against Harvard President Claudine Gay” which is about the nicest way to say they made mountains out of mole hills)\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Expands Efforts to Fight Antisemitism as Trump Deal Seems Near\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/nyregion/columbia-plan-to-fight-antisemitism.html\n\nMs. Shipman announced that the changes would include formally incorporating the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism into the work of a recently established office at Columbia that considers complaints of discrimination and discriminatory harassment.\n\n\nIn addition, Columbia will appoint two new coordinators to oversee investigations into claims of discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Those coordinators will produce a publicly available report each year about discrimination investigations and their results.\n\n\nThe university will also institute new educational programs about antisemitism for students and faculty and staff members, including those developed by national organizations such as Project Shema, a training and support organization, and the Anti-Defamation League. And it will reaffirm that it has zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment based on protected traits, including Jewish and Israeli identity.\n\n\nJoseph Howley, a professor of classics and supporter of the pro-Palestinian movement on campus, was critical for different reasons. The definition of antisemitism being adopted by the university, he said, “is not informed by scholarly expertise or even best practice. So it’s not the best framework for confronting hate speech, and it’s not going to solve real problems of discrimination or harassment.”\n\n\nAnti-Semitism Gets the DEI Treatment - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/columbia-anti-semitism-trump/683586/\n\nTo do the same thing over and over and expect a different result is one definition of insanity. According to Robert Shibley, a special counsel of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), it’s also Columbia University’s approach to addressing anti-Semitism on campus.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Claire Shipman, Columbia’s acting president, announced in an email to the community that the university would take several steps to quell anti-Semitism on campus. Columbia will appoint Title VI and Title VII coordinators to review allegations of discrimination. It will launch new programming around anti-Jewish discrimination, send out regular messages affirming its zero-tolerance policy on hate, and use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of anti-Semitism for certain disciplinary proceedings. In her message, Shipman promised that the university would continue making reforms until it had stamped out anti-Semitism. “In a recent discussion, a faculty member and I agreed that anti-Semitism at this institution has existed, perhaps less overtly, for a long while, and the work of dismantling it, especially through education and understanding, will take time,” she wrote.\n\n\nThe message was notable for how closely it resembled the communications that university presidents have previously sent out about other forms of discrimination. Replace the references to “anti-Semitism” with “racism,” and Shipman’s message could practically have been lifted from the statements of summer 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy attack colleges? To open students’ minds or blow up institutions?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/07/16/trump-dei-george-mason-university/\n\nNow, the mission has gone off the rails: The Trump administration is coming for George Mason University, one of Virginia’s largest colleges, which has done more than almost any other campus in the country to become conservative-friendly.\n\n\nSadly, George Mason’s course will likely be determined not by its president or faculty, but by politicians in Richmond and judges in courtrooms. A Fairfax County judge is expected to rule later this month on a move by Democrats in the Virginia Senate to block approval of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s (R) nominees to the school’s board. And when Virginia voters choose a new governor this fall, they will be deciding who gets to nominate board members next year.\n\n\nThere was a time, not long ago, when governance of public universities was a bipartisan effort, devoted to building civic knowledge and advancing the skills of the next generation. Politics and culture wars weren’t the primary focus.\n\n\nwe have unthinking attacks on any and all colleges — another example of government gone wild. Trump campaigned last year on smacking down elite colleges’ “Marxist assault on our American heritage and Western civilization itself.” What’s he delivering, perversely enough, is his own reactionary assault on the institutions that transmit our heritage to the inheritors of our democracy.\n\n\nGeorge Mason President Defends Univ. Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/18/gmu-president-responds-civil-rights-investigation\n\n“I can assure you that George Mason has always operated with a commitment to equality under the law, ever since our inception,” he wrote. ”It is simply the Mason way, and in my experience, it has not discriminated based on race, color, national origin, or otherwise. Our diversity efforts are designed to expand opportunity and build inclusive excellence—not to exclude or advantage any group unlawfully.”\n\n\nHe offered a brief history of Title VI—which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in federally funded programs—and the rest of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Then, without naming any names, he essentially accused the Trump administration of willfully misinterpreting the law.\n\n\n“Today, we are seeing a profound shift in how Title VI is being applied,” he wrote. “Longstanding efforts to address inequality—such as mentoring programs, inclusive hiring practices, and support for historically underrepresented groups—are in many cases being reinterpreted as presumptively unlawful. Broad terms like ‘illegal DEI’ are now used without definition, allowing virtually any initiative that touches on identity or inclusion to be painted as discriminatory.\n\n\nTrump administration expands scrutiny of George Mason University\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/17/george-mason-doj-investigation/\n\nThe investigation [into the alleged use of race in hiring and promotions at George Mason University ] is the third launched by the administration in recent weeks into the policies and practices at the Northern Virginia university, and the first inquiry into the school led by the Justice Department.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs U-Va. president leaves, faculty say board failed to protect university\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/11/university-of-virginia-faculty-board-no-confidence-ryan/\n\nUniversity of Virginia faculty passed a vote of no confidence Friday in the school’s governing body, saying it failed to protect against “outside interference” by the Trump administration that led to the eventual resignation of President James E. Ryan.\n\n\nThe vote by the U-Va. faculty senate — which came on Ryan’s last day in office — called on the board to provide faculty with an “immediate and complete accounting” of its response to inquiries by the Justice Department in recent months.\n\n\nThe board leaders also said the Justice Department investigations were ongoing and that they would work hard to reach a voluntary settlement with the Trump administration as soon as they could.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Hiring: Title VI Coordinators\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/diversity/2025/07/14/colleges-hire-title-vi-coordinators-amid-federal-scrutiny\n\nin fiscal year 2022, before the Israel-Hamas war began, allegations of Title VI violations made up only 17.3 percent of the complaints OCR received, in comparison with Title XI (49.2 percent) and the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 (33.4 percent), which protect against disability discrimination.\n\n\nThe number of Title VI complaints increased 29.4 percent over the next two years. Complaints related to shared ancestry increased sevenfold from 2023 to 2024.\n\n\nIn other cases, it was a proactive step. In April, the State University of New York system, the largest public college system in the nation, required each of its campuses to bring on a Title VI coordinator by fall 2025.\n\n\n“We really have tried to be very thoughtful about ensuring that all of our campuses are safe and supportive environments free from harassment and discrimination. We take Title IX enforcement seriously,” said SUNY chancellor John B. King in an interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina “Will Blow Us Away” if Trump Destroys U.S. Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/07/17/china-will-blow-us-away-if-trump-destroys-us\n\nThe first Nobel Prize–winning scientist to join a White House cabinet, Steven Chu made history when he became Barack Obama’s energy secretary in 2009. But his move to Washington cost him an incredible $300 million.\n\n\n“I joined the Nvidia board in 2004, before the company took off, but I had to sell my shares in 2009 when I joined government,” Chu said about his early involvement in the microchip firm that recently became the world’s most valuable company with a $4 trillion capitalization.\n\n\nSanguine about his lost wealth, Chu’s main takeaway from Nvidia is not his own misfortune. Instead, he worries that this American success story—co-created by a Taiwanese-born Stanford graduate, employing foreign-born engineering talent—might not have been able to happen today given the double whammy faced by U.S. academia: massive cuts to federal science budgets and an immigration crackdown deterring many students, particularly from China, from applying to U.S. institutions.\n\n\nWithout America’s outstanding universities and with its foreign talent pool diminished, China’s path to global dominance will be immeasurably easier, predicted Chu. “Trump is perfectly willing to destroy institutions that any country in the world would give its eyeteeth for,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Happens After A.I. Destroys College Writing?\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/07/the-end-of-the-english-paper\n\nHe opened Claude on his laptop. I noticed a chat that mentioned abolition. “We had to read Robert Wedderburn for a class,” he explained, referring to the nineteenth-century Jamaican abolitionist. “But, obviously, I wasn’t tryin’ to read that.” He had prompted Claude for a summary, but it was too long for him to read in the ten minutes he had before class started. He told me, “I said, ‘Turn it into concise bullet points.’” He then transcribed Claude’s points in his notebook, since his professor ran a screen-free classroom.\n\n\nI teach at a small liberal-arts college, and I often joke that a student is more likely to hand in a big paper a year late (as recently happened) than to take a dishonorable shortcut.\n\n\nThere are no reliable figures for how many American students use A.I., just stories about how everyone is doing it. A 2024 Pew Research Center survey of students between the ages of thirteen and seventeen suggests that a quarter of teens currently use ChatGPT for schoolwork, double the figure from 2023. OpenAI recently released a report claiming that one in three college students uses its products. There’s good reason to believe that these are low estimates.\n\n\nCorey Robin, a writer and a professor of political science at Brooklyn College, read the early stories about ChatGPT with skepticism. Then his daughter, a sophomore in high school at the time, used it to produce an essay that was about as good as those his undergraduates wrote after a semester of work. He decided to stop assigning take-home essays. For the first time in his thirty years of teaching, he administered in-class exams.\n\n\nBarry Lam teaches in the philosophy department at the University of California, Riverside, and hosts a popular podcast, Hi-Phi Nation, which applies philosophical modes of inquiry to everyday topics. He began wondering what it would mean for A.I. to actually be a productivity tool. … If students were learning things faster, then it stood to reason that Lam could assign them “something very hard.” He wanted to test this theory, so for final exams he gave his undergraduates a Ph.D.-level question involving denotative language and the German logician Gottlob Frege which was, frankly, beyond me.\n\n\n“They fucking failed it miserably,” he said. He adjusted his grading curve accordingly.\n\n\nWhen classes were over and students were moving into their summer housing, I e-mailed with Alex, who was settling in in the East Village. He’d just finished his finals, and estimated that he’d spent between thirty minutes and an hour composing two papers for his humanities classes. Without the assistance of Claude, it might have taken him around eight or nine hours. “I didn’t retain anything,” he wrote. “I couldn’t tell you the thesis for either paper hahhahaha.” He received an A-minus and a B-plus. ♦\n\n\nNYTimes: I’m Watching the Sacrifice of College’s Soul\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/opinion/college-soul-ai-education.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAnd perhaps a certain idea of college — a certain ideal of college — is dying. I [Frank Bruni] keep coming back to that possibility, which seems more like a probability since President Trump returned to the White House and began his assault on higher education.\n\n\nWhat happened to college as a theater of intellectual betterment, character development, self-discovery? Easy A’s work against that, replacing rigor with ready affirmation. A.I. also works against that: Why spend hour upon hour synthesizing knowledge when a few keystrokes will do the trick? And measuring schools by their financial return on students’ investments … occludes higher education’s other important functions. Colleges are supposed to nurture nimble thinkers. They’re meant to produce informed and enlightened citizens who are better equipped to leaven passion with reason. There’s a deficit of those now, as ominous as any budgetary shortfall.\n\n\nZimmerman [renowned historian of education at the University of Pennsylvania] said. “We continue to tell a story about the mind-expanding purpose and qualities of a university, and no doubt some people who come here experience that mind expansion. The problem is that all of the other cultural and social signals around them are pointing them in the other direction.”\n\n\nThe moral of those two stories is that the smartest approach to college may be precisely the one that its trajectory of late has conspired against: range widely across subject offerings and focus not on a skill that could become obsolete but on intellectual dexterity and powers of judgment with better odds of enduring relevance. “A liberal arts degree is a preprofessional degree — you just don’t know what the profession is,” said Zimmerman, who teaches a seminar for first-year students at U. Penn. called “Why College?”\n\n\nBut higher education as a blessing independent of any instantly redeemable credential bucks the zeitgeist. Under Trump, blunt materialism reigns, and such concepts as human rights, diplomacy and even democracy are suspect, the precious preoccupation of idealistic chumps. Do anthropology, philosophy and history stand a chance?\n\n\nWhite House officials are preparing an executive order targeting tech companies with what they see as “woke” artificial-intelligence models, their latest effort to go after diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/white-house-prepares-executive-order-targeting-woke-ai-e68e8e24?st=eqQBGd&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(As Krugman noted in a recent newsletter: “So in modern Republican rhetoric, anything to the left of MAGA ideology is communist extremism. And here’s the thing: The answers you get from AI generally don’t adhere to the right-wing party line. … it all goes back to Stephen Colbert’s dictum, almost 20 years ago, that “reality has a well-known liberal bias.” )\n\nThe order would dictate that AI companies getting federal contracts be politically neutral and unbiased in their AI models, an effort to combat what administration officials see as liberal bias in some models, the people said.\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

Plus, the NYT reported her characterization of CAIR is wholly unfounded.\nHer question about CUNY clear was so poorly framed as to require a reprimand by the ranking member in his closing – people accused deserve representation and the egregious examples of this particular case are so bad something could have been said beyond they choose their own cases.\nThe Hunter College questions involved showing someone’s email–doxxing–and was essentially a call for punishment for involving the police in a police matter. [thanks EI]\nThe questions about Jewish Faculty being represented by the PSC from one congressman who tried to get the Chancellor to admit it was unfair could have had much more pushback – this case was appealed to the supreme court which declined to hear it. Basically this congressman was asking the Chancellor to go against several judge’s opinions. Maybe pointing that out shows the ridiculousness of this and other questions.\nThe PSC positions were mis-characterized; the PSC Chair was personally dragged and mis-characterized–the rope-a-dope that the union is an independent group could have been turned into a counterattack to the assault on faculty unions in general.\nIf any good came out of this, hopefully it will be the republican majority realizing these hearings have totally lost their potency. Maybe the reporting next time will pick up the consistent message of the democrats that these aren’t seriously trying to understand a problem.)\n\n3 College Presidents Went to Congress. Here’s What They Talked About.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/3-college-presidents-went-to-congress-heres-what-they-talked-about\n(Thanks BE for summarizing these links, VAC for sharing)\n\nThe congressional hearings don’t appear to pack as much punch as they once did, when it felt like college presidents’ jobs were on the line.\n\n\nThe Trump administration’s campaign is like The Wizard of Oz, he [Nosanchuk, former civil-rights official] said, because it’s “projecting an intimidating, demanding, and illusory image of action, but here the man behind the curtain cancels funds for civil-rights enforcement and cancer research.”\n\n\nRep. Virginia Foxx, a Republican of North Carolina, mentioned the fact that the influential union has passed multiple BDS resolutions, and that it has been found responsible for discrimination against a Jewish faculty member by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, the president of the PSC, James C. Davis, slammed Republicans’ “attempt to smear CUNY and our union as antisemitic.”\n\n\n“We do not accept the false premise that underlies today’s hearing that any campus activism in support of the Palestinian people is antisemitic, if not criminal,” Davis wrote. “As a union, we do not have a position on BDS and do not have Israel divestment policies.”\n\n\n3 More Campus Leaders Face Congress\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/16/3-more-campus-leaders-face-congress\n\nFor the fifth time since late 2023, congressional Republicans on Tuesday interrogated a group of university leaders about campus antisemitism. But unlike previous hearings, this one was short on fireworks and viral moments\n\n\nHouse Republicans Grill CUNY Chief on Campus Antisemitism Claims\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/07/15/cuny-felix-matos-rodriguez-antisemitism-house-elise-stefanik/\n(Grill was the headline choice of many others, mostly the slanted right side of reporting)\n\nSome of the toughest questioning of Matos Rodríguez again came from Stefanik, an ally of President Donald Trump who is reportedly considering a run for governor in New York after the president withdrew her nomination to be U.N. Ambassador to protect Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\n\nPSC president Davis then went on to decry what he saw as a clamp down on free speech across the university campuses.\n\n\n“CUNY administrators have investigated faculty for the terms in which they discuss the war in Gaza in their classes, limited the time, place, and manner for exercising the right to free expression on campus, invited police violence against non-violent student protestors, and even fired faculty in apparent retribution for their political activism,” Davis said. “It is still not enough to satisfy the new McCarthyites. Universities must stand against fascism, not accommodate it.”\n\n\nNYTimes: University Leaders Reject Republican Attacks on Campus Antisemitism\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/us/politics/antisemitism-hearing-uc-berkeley-georgetown-cuny.html\n\nOn Tuesday, Republicans accused the university leaders of fostering an antisemitic climate and failing to rein in professors and students the lawmakers said were antisemitic. Democrats on the committee argued the hearing was part of a crackdown on speech that attempted to scapegoat academia for a broader societal problem.\n\n\nThe university leaders, meanwhile, seemed to have learned from the past. They attempted, with apparent success, to avoid the kinds of viral moments that have characterized previous antisemitism hearings and brought down other university presidents.\n\n\nShe [Stefanik] attacked CUNY for hiring a former employee of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights organization, inaccurately suggesting that CAIR had been a “co-conspirator in a terrorist financing case.” (The group was listed as an “unindicted co-conspirator or joint venturer” in a case against a charity, the Holy Land Foundation, along with more than 200 other groups and individuals. It was not accused of a crime.)\n\n\nResponding to Ms. Stefanik’s attacks on Tuesday, CAIR’s national deputy director, Edward Ahmed Mitchell, said the “spirit of Joseph McCarthy is alive and well.” “Representing Mahmoud Khalil and others targeted by the government because they advocated for Palestinian rights is not only our prerogative as lawyers at CLEAR,” said Mr. Kassem, the CUNY law professor who founded the legal clinic, “it is also our pride and privilege.”\n\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik skewers CUNY chancellor, calls for his ouster over ‘failed’ leadership on NYC campus antisemitism\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2025/07/15/us-news/rep-elise-stefanik-skewers-cuny-chancellor-calls-for-his-ouster-over-failed-leadership-on-nyc-campus-antisemitism/\n(Cuz why? don’t ask – CUNY hired someone she didn’t like who in several years has no complaints mentioned about her work; lawyers represent people before they are proven not guilty or guilty?)\n\nThe Republican congresswoman zeroed in on Chancellor Félix Matos Rodríguez over the hiring of a chief diversity officer who previously worked for a pro-Hamas, Israel-bashing group — saying that if the CUNY boss doesn’t step down, Gov. Kathy Hochul should bounce him.\n\n\nStefanik also asked Matos Rodríguez if he knew that law professor Ramzi Kassem, the head of CUNY Law School’s legal clinic, Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility or CLEAR, was representing Mahmoud Khalil, the anti-Israel Columbia University protester who was detained by the Trump administration.\n\n\nIn a joint press conference after the hearing with Brooklyn Councilwoman Inna Vernikov in DC, Stefanik said Matos Rodríguez had to go, and claimed Hochul was part of the problem.\n\n(Just testing their powers; doubt either was packing today, but can’t vouch for that on other days.)\n(And what is wrong with the Post? In several hours of testimony they couldn’t find one unflattering photo?)\n\nConservatives Denounce Professor for ‘Symbolic Strike’ Post\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/07/18/republicans-denounce-georgetown-professor-post-iran\n\nOn June 22, the United States bombed Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities. Observers wondered whether it was the start of another lengthy, destructive American war in the Middle East.\n\n\nHours later, a conservative social media account with more than 4.3 million followers highlighted one response—allegedly from a Georgetown University professor. According to a screenshot the Libs of TikTok X account posted, Jonathan Brown, the Alwaleed bin Talal Chair of Islamic Civilization, had written on X, “I hope Iran does some symbolic strike on a base, then everyone stops.”\n\n\nWhat transpired is becoming a familiar story in U.S. higher education: Conservatives denounce a faculty member’s speech, members of Congress join in and eventually pressure a prestigious university’s president to publicly denounce and punish the scholar.\n\n\nGreg Afinogenov, an associate history professor and president of Georgetown’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said Brown has received “death threats, his family has come under attack and members of the university administration have also criticized him and disavowed him.”\n\n\nAfinogenov said the university should clarify that Brown’s post was “protected speech.”\n\n\n“This procedure of hauling members of university administrations before” a “congressional kangaroo court” harms academic freedom, he said. Administrators should push back against these “smear campaigns,” and Georgetown should articulate a policy to protect faculty and other members of the university community from retaliation for their “extramural speech,” such as on social media, he said.\n\n\nCongress attacked CUNY on falsehoods\n\nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/2025/07/18/congress-attacked-cuny-on-falsehoods/\n(PSC Chair has this op-ed)\n\nPlease, provide an email to continue reading this article for free.

    "text": "What Trump’s Bombast Reveals About His Vision for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/15/how-public-attacks-harvard-harm-all-higher-ed\n\nQ: Do you think the administration has a vision for higher education in particular?\n\n\nA: I think it’s a vision for America, and Trump has been remarkably clear on what that looks like. It’s an America defined pretty narrowly on racial, ethnic and religious terms. It’s an America that has a certain understanding of its history that aligns with those dominant religious, racial and ethnic groups. It’s an America that has doubled down on masculinity as its defining gender in terms of who should be in power and have power in public life. So when we talk about a vision for higher ed, it’s a higher ed that serves that.\n\n\nThis is what you see in these very vague pronouncements about things like DEI. Anyone who educates or does research on anything that runs counter to that celebration of a very particularistic America is suspect and un-American. Higher ed is part of a whole set of knowledge-producing institutions in society—we can think about journalists and scientists, too— as being problematic because they serve accountability functions. They hold corporations responsible for things like polluting. They hold executives responsible for violations of democratic norms. Or, you know, they hold people in power accountable for not being good custodians of public trust. I think the administration wants to weaken that accountability function that can be played by universities because it undermines, ultimately, their ability to exercise power in the service of that larger vision of what they believe America should be.\n\n\nQ: You mentioned vague pronouncements about things like DEI. What conclusions do you draw from this tactic of sowing confusion and using unclear and undefined language?\n\n\nA: Ultimately, the end goal is control. They have a few tools to do so—legal means, regulatory means—and they have a lot of funding means to get institutions that are otherwise autonomous in civil society to comply with what they want them to do. But in the absence of those levers, what do you use? Well, you use publicity to get willing compliance or anticipatory compliance.\n\n\nWhy Universities Are So Powerless in Their Fight Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/why-universities-are-so-powerless-in-their-fight-against-trump\n\nThe administration’s moves to slash federal funding are just one part of a concerted effort to force major research universities to change how they pursue their core missions. And yet the sector’s most full-throated response — an American Association of Colleges and Universities statement signed by over 600 academic leaders — makes only vague reference to “constructive reform” while rejecting coercive uses of public funding. Widely adopted faculty resolutions calling for mutual-defense pacts amount to little more than suggestions that have yet to bear fruit. The most successful instances of collective resistance to date are four lawsuits challenging agency indirect-cost policies. By my count, 23 universities have joined at least one of those suits.\n\n\nA decentralized organizational structure puts resources and decision-making authority nearer to the ground, allowing different units of the university to prioritize the things their work requires. Faculties in business, social work, or law can make curricular, hiring, and promotion decisions largely independent of each other and of colleagues in arts and sciences, each tuning their activities to their specific needs, goals, and vision. Decentralization also explains why universities rarely articulate detailed, actionable principles that unequivocally guide institutionwide decision-making — or at least why, when they do proffer strategic plans or mission statements, the results are often anodyne.\n\n\nUniversities are organized to hold contradictions, not to resolve them. Typical academic decision-making processes manage the ambiguities that multiple goals create in lieu of picking winners in the underlying conflicts. That works well in normal times, but it is disastrously bad for reaching, communicating, and acting on common priorities under threat. Yet universities’ public missions may now require them to do just that.\n\n\nProminent conservatives generally agree that hardball tactics are necessary to compel desired changes in academe. JD Vance advocated for “honestly and aggressively” attacking universities. Leo Terrell, who heads the Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, wants financial pressures “to bring these universities to their knees.” As the conservative commentator Heather Mac Donald puts it: “The concept of academic freedom should be scaled back to allow funders — especially taxpayers — a say in how universities are run, including in what is taught.” The activist Christopher F. Rufo believes “existential terror” will provide the leverage needed to make an ultimatum stick: “Reform, or lose billions in funding.” That threat is now being carried out, and the administration’s will to back it up has been on clear display. As Robert Kelchen put it, “Every revenue source is at risk.” Federal research grants and contracts are just the beginning.\n\n\nThe Columbia example shows that the decisions institutions targeted by the Trump administration face have far-reaching, complex implications that take them far outside the standard mechanisms of academic leadership. The most easily defensible choice for any institution may be to protect its interests by negotiating for the best individual deal. But, as one Harvard professor pointed out, “that might be quite bad for higher education as a whole.”\n\n\nThe Harvard case has, so far, revealed this administration’s willingness to flip every policy lever available to them to reshape universities. It suggests a more complex landscape and more wrenching decisions are in store — choices that will certainly pit a university against itself, further fragmenting and undermining coordinated responses.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Winning the Race to the Bottom\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/17/opinion/trump-america-china.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nPopulists are anti-intellectual. President Trump isn’t pumping research money into the universities; he’s draining it out. The administration is not tripling the National Science Foundation’s budget; it’s trying to gut it. The administration is trying to cut all federal basic research funding by a third, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. A survey by the journal Nature of 1,600 scientists in the United States found that three-quarters of them have considered leaving the country.\n\n\nAmerica’s leaders understood that a superpower rivalry is as much an intellectual contest as a military and economic one. It’s who can out-innovate whom. So they fought the Soviet threat with education, with the goal of maximizing talent on our side.\n\n\n“One reason the U.S. economy had such a good Cold War was that the American university had an ever better one,” the historian Hal Brands writes in his book “The Twilight Struggle.” Federal support for academic research rose to $1.45 billion in 1970 from $254 million in 1958. Earlier in that century, American universities lagged behind their “best” European peers, Brands observes; by the end of the Cold War, they dominated the globe.",

    "text": "New Report on the State of Academic Governance in Community Colleges\n\n(Thanks to JC and VAC)\nhttps://www.aaup.org/news/new-report-state-academic-governance-community-colleges\n\nAt most responding institutions, and especially at responding institutions with tenure systems, faculty authority is consistent with AAUP-recommended governance standards in decision-making about programmatic, departmental, and institutional curricula; teaching assignments; salary policies; and faculty searches, evaluations, and tenure and promotion standards.\n\n\nHowever, in several decision-making areas, including budgets, buildings, provost selection, and strategic planning, community college faculty have few meaningful opportunities to participate. In these areas, community colleges deviate from the principles set forth in the AAUP’s 1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities, which emphasizes faculty involvement in personnel decisions and budget preparation.\n\n\nStatistically significant differences in the level of faculty authority between unionized and nonunionized colleges appear in only three of the twenty-six areas, a finding that mirrors that in the AAUP’s 2021 Shared Governance Survey of four-year institutions. Specifically, institutions where the faculty engages in collective bargaining have higher levels of faculty authority in areas related to salary policies teaching loads, and, in the case of community colleges, full-time non-tenure-track faculty promotion decisions.\n\n\nAcross most areas of academic and personnel decision-making, levels of faculty authority are lower at community colleges than at four-year institutions. However, faculty members at community colleges have more involvement in salary policies than those at four-year institutions; the difference is likely related to the higher prevalence of institutions with collective bargaining in the community college sector.",

    "text": "Texas just gutted free speech on college campuses. Is your state next?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/07/14/texas-campus-free-speech/\n\nAcross the country, state legislators have been racing to exert new influence over free expression in higher education. Now, Texas has surged to the forefront, closing its 2025 legislative session by passing two alarming laws that take effect Sept. 1.\n\n\nthe new laws amount to a stunningly aggressive legislative crackdown on campus protest (S.B. 2972) and academic shared governance (S.B. 37) at public colleges and universities. The laws will not just silence dissent and undermine faculty authority in Texas; they provide a blueprint for how to dismantle academic freedom and chill speech on campus state by state.\n\n\nNow, some of the same legislators have done an about-face. The campus protest law actually directs public colleges and universities to implement a version of free-speech zones and adopt sweeping limitations on protests. Encampments? Banned. Megaphones or speakers during “class hours”? Forbidden — if anyone claims your “expressive activity” is one that “intimidates others” or “interferes” with an employee’s duties. Even wearing a mask during a protest — something many do for safety — could land a student or employee a disciplinary hearing resulting in “sanctions.” And any expressive activity between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. is off-limits altogether.\n\n\nState law defines “expressive activity” as “any speech or expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment” — speeches, writing, art, symbolic actions, even just talking to your friends. It’s problematic enough that legislators seek to prohibit nighttime or early-morning protest activity, but the language could affect late-night art events, student journalists, and even assigned research, course or thesis work for students or faculty in the habit of burning the midnight oil. The new law is so absurdly broad it could theoretically be used to stop a group of students from discussing politics on a campus bench at night. That’s not security; it’s suppression.\n\n\nAnd this is just half the story.\n\n\nThe second new law in Texas is an outright power grab dismantling shared governance, the cornerstone of U.S. higher education. Typically, higher education institutions have democratic systems to share power and foster collaboration among administrators, governing boards and faculty. Faculty senates, whose members are typically elected by faculty, exercise authority over curricular matters, academic policies and graduation requirements. In addition, they often play a role in general institutional decisions, such as related to planning, budgeting or the evaluation of administrators.\n\n\nThe Texas legislature obliterates these traditions, stripping faculty of any meaningful decision-making role in how their institutions are run. Under this law, faculty senates at public universities and colleges can now exist only if permitted by the institutions’ governing boards — the oversight bodies whose members are politically appointed by the state governor. In mockery of democratic principles, half of the faculty senate members must be chosen by the university president, and administrators can remove faculty for not conducting their duties within vague “senate parameters.”\n\n\nTo make matters worse, the law installs a governor-appointed “ombudsman” with sweeping enforcement powers. This political appointee will be charged with monitoring compliance with state laws and can recommend that a public university or college lose all state funding unless it complies.\n\n\n\n\nTech billionaire Trump adviser Marc Andreesen says universities will ‘pay the price’ for DEI\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/07/12/marc-andreessen-private-chat-universities-diversity/\n\nThe investor described a “counterattack” against universities in his messages and called for the National Science Foundation, a federal research funding agency, to receive “the bureaucratic death penalty.”\n\n\n“The universities are at Ground Zero of the counterattack” from Trump voters, Andreessen wrote, alleging colleges favored immigrants over Americans and promoted DEI, or diversity, equity, and inclusion policies intended to increase race and gender representation.\n\n\n“The combination of DEI and immigration is politically lethal,” Andreessen wrote. “When these two forms of discrimination combine, as they have for the last 60 years and on hyperdrive for the last decade, they systematically cut most of the children of the Trump voter base out of any realistic prospect of access to higher education and corporate America.”\n\n(Yeah, right)\n\n\nNYTimes: Inside the Conservative Campaign That Took Down the U.Va. President\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/us/politics/university-virginia-president-trump-dei-jefferson-council.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFor years, the group [The Jefferson Council] had railed against the university’s president, James E. Ryan, for his robust promotion of campus diversity initiatives.\n\n\nThe Justice Department then hired a lawyer to help enforce those orders at the Office of Civil Rights: Gregory W. Brown, a University of Virginia alumnus and donor.\n\n\nThe Jefferson Council and the Office of Civil Rights separately denied in interviews that they had worked in concert. But the council had at least set the table for what came next. And in his new position, Mr. Brown helped engineer an unusual and concerted pressure campaign that would lead to Mr. Ryan’s resignation.\n\n\nAnd in his new position, Mr. Brown helped engineer an unusual and concerted pressure campaign that would lead to Mr. Ryan’s resignation.\n\n\nThat campaign showed just how far the Office of Civil Rights — which had for decades been at the center of the fight for racial equality — would go to take on universities that it views as hostile to its new agenda. By issuing a stream of demands and threats, the office essentially sped past the university board, appointed by the governor, that has oversight of its flagship public university.\n\n\n“What the Justice Department did was very similar to what President Eisenhower did,” Mr. Gardner [the Jefferson Council president] said, comparing the Trump administration’s actions to the 1957 White House decision to dispatch troops to Little Rock, Ark., to enforce the Supreme Court’s school desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education.\n\n(Uhh…)\n\nThere were other requests [In addition to the 7 letters]. The New York Times reported that the Trump administration had privately demanded Mr. Ryan’s ouster to help resolve its investigation into the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, according to three people briefed on the matter.\n\n\nMs. Dhillon, in an interview with the Times, denied that her office had pressured the university to remove its president.",

    "text": "Higher-Ed Associations Pitch an Alternative to Trump’s Cap on Research Funding\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/higher-ed-associations-pitch-an-alternative-to-trumps-cap-on-research-funding\n\nThe Joint Associations Group, or JAG, which includes the Association of American Universities (AAU), the American Council on Education (ACE), and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), announced its proposal on Friday. The coalition sees its plan as a middle ground, one that responds to long-held gripes about how indirect costs are administered while lessening the billions in lost revenue for universities under the 15-percent indirect-cost cap proposed by several federal agencies, among them the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Departments of Defense and Energy.\n\n\nThe plan’s true effect on how much universities would receive for indirect costs is unclear. H. Holden Thorp, editor in chief of the Science family of journals and a former university chancellor, who is not part of JAG but has reviewed the proposal, said such a fundamental change to how universities balance their research budgets will be costly. The amount of funding received under the FAIR model “absolutely will be less,” he said, but “it won’t be as bad as it was going to be” under the Trump administration’s proposed 15-percent cap.\n\n\n\n\nHouse Appropriators Propose 23% Cut to NSF\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/15/house-appropriators-propose-23-cut-nsf\n\nHouse Republicans want to cut the National Science Foundation’s funding by about $2 billion, according to budget documents released Monday.\n\n\nStill, funding for NSF is already one point of disagreement between House and Senate appropriators. Last week, Senate Republicans indicated that they would cut only about $16 million from NSF, leaving the agency with just over $9 billion.\n\n\nThe House plan, which would give NSF about $7 billion, is just a proposal and doesn’t go as far as President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026, which cuts more than $5 billion from the agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Live Updates: Supreme Court Clears Way for Dismantling of Education Department\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/07/14/us/trump-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe order is a significant victory for the administration and could ease President Trump’s efforts to sharply curtail the federal government’s role in the nation’s schools.\n\n\nIt also represents an expansion of presidential power, allowing Mr. Trump to functionally eliminate a government department created by Congress, without legislators’ input.\n\n\nIt comes after a decision by the justices last week that cleared the way for the Trump administration to move forward with cutting thousands of jobs across a number of federal agencies, including the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, State and Treasury.\n\n\nThe order by the court was unsigned and gave no reasoning, as is typical in such emergency applications. No vote count was given, which is usual for emergency orders, but Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissent, joined by the court’s other two liberals, Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\n\nThe order is technically temporary, applying while appeals proceed through the courts. In practice, thousands of fired workers whom a Boston judge had ordered be reinstated are now again subject to removal from their jobs.\n\n(Sotamayor)\n\nThe President must take care that the laws are faithfully executed, not set out to dismantle them. That basic rule undergirds our Constitution’s separation of powers. Yet today, the majority rewards clear defiance of that core principle with emergency relief. Because I cannot condone such abuse of our equitable authority, I respectfully dissent.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/14/supreme-court-education-department-/\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/supreme-court-ruling-trump-education-department-workers-a2baa879?st=DhfBSW&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nThe Education Department Got a Green Light to Shrink.

It worries faculty and scholarly groups, who stress that the number of majors in a program isn’t the only or best way to gauge its worth.\n\n\n“Campuses are forced to respond to legislative mandates that have arisen from a narrow understanding of what higher education is,” said Paula Krebs, executive director of the Modern Language Association.

    "text": "NYTimes: How Trump’s crackdown on universities is affecting the world\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/07/13/us/2025-06-06-int-science-reaction-index.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUniversities are an easy target for right-wing populists. Polls show that a lot of Americans consider them too liberal, too expensive and too elitist, and not entirely without reason.\n\n(Why the lede needs to add that last bit is beyond me…)\n\nToday, the biggest beneficiary could be China and Chinese universities, which have been trying to recruit world-class scientific talent for years. Now Mr. Trump is doing their work for them. One indication of the success of China’s campaign to attract the best and brightest is Africa, the world’s youngest continent. Africans are learning Mandarin in growing numbers. Nearly twice as many study in China as in America.\n\n\nCould America gamble away its scientific supremacy in the service of ideology? It has happened before. Under the Nazis, Germany lost its scientific edge to America in the space of a few years. As a German, my brain may wander too readily to the lessons of the 1930s, but in this case the analogy feels instructive. Several of my colleagues covering the fallout from the crackdown on international students and researchers pointed to Hitler’s silencing of scientists and intellectuals.\n\n\nI don’t sense a big change in the mood in India yet. The United States still holds a lot of soft power and remains very attractive to Indians. In fact, many Indians are seeing something that is pretty familiar to them. They’re saying, “Welcome to the world as we have experienced it for the past few years.” The government under Narendra Modi has definitely cracked down on free speech. It has tried to quash dissenting voices, and it has also leaned on academics and has tried to squeeze certain research institutions that it considers too liberal. And there has been a demonization of the Muslim minority, which make up about 15 percent of the population. There are a lot of similarities to Trump’s America. Everyone in the world is just trying to understand what Trump’s actions mean for their own countries. So India’s experience can be instructive in making sense of this moment. [Anupreeta Das is a South Asia correspondent for the Times,]\n\n\nChina really wants to become a center for international education, because it sees that as a key ingredient for building its reputation as a global superpower. American universities have long been a source of American soft power. China wants Chinese universities to be a source of Chinese soft power. And now Trump is doing their work for them. You can see that in China’s rhetoric and messaging. It’s trying to portray itself as open and international, everything that the Trump administration is turning away from. [Vivian Wang is a correspondent for the Times in Beijing]\n\n\n\n\nTrump wields his ‘secret weapon’: College accreditation\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/12/trump-college-accreditation-political-influence/\n(“his” What about just saying weaponizing …)\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his allies are using a little-known but powerful corner of higher education — college accreditation — to exert pressure on colleges and universities, an effort that threatens the independence of accreditors and the stability of the institutions they approve.\n\n\nThis week, the Education and Health and Human Services departments encouraged Harvard University’s accreditor to take action against the Ivy League school for allegedly violating the civil rights of Jewish students. The New England Commission of Higher Education, which accredits Harvard, said it has given the university until Aug. 15 to respond and will take up the matter at a previously scheduled meeting in September.\n\n\nThe administration took a similar step in early June over Columbia University’s alleged civil rights violations. By the end of June, Columbia’s accreditor, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, issued the school a noncompliance warning. Middle States did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n“It’s unusual for [the Office of Civil Rights] to directly involve itself in accrediting matters,” said John R. Przypyszny, a lawyer who specializes in accreditation.\n\n\nWhile the Trump administration has no direct control over whether the schools remain accredited, it could punish accreditors for failing to act by stripping them of the authority needed to operate. And a recent move by the Education Department is raising questions about whether the administration is dangling that possibility over Harvard and Columbia’s accreditors.\n\n\nA day after notifying Columbia’s accreditor of the Ivy League school’s alleged violations in June, the Education Department postponed a meeting of the federal advisory committee that oversees accreditors from July to October. The 18-member committee was scheduled to vote this summer on whether Middle States and the New England Commission should remain certified to accredit colleges.\n\n\nBy the time the committee meets this fall, the terms of six of its members will have expired. The House, Senate and education secretary take turns appointing members, and this time the secretary will fill all six seats. That gives the Trump administration a chance to select people who are aligned with its ideology on higher education.\n\n\n“It seems like they’re trying to fix the vote,” said Robert Shireman, a member of the committee who is also a senior fellow at the left-leaning Century Foundation.\n\n\nSeveral committee members said the Education Department flouted the rules of the panel, which says only the chair can set a meeting schedule. When Zakiya Smith Ellis, who assumed the role of chair in February, pointed that out, she said the department told her it did not recognize her as chair because she took over the position when the previous chair resigned.\n\n\nDespite Reservations, Florida Approves New Accreditor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/state-policy/2025/07/11/despite-reservations-florida-bog-approves-new-accreditor\n\nThe decision came after about an hour of heated discussion between board members and the State University System of Florida’s chancellor regarding details of the plan.\n\n\nChancellor Raymond Rodriguez argued that the new accreditor, called the Commission for Public Higher Education, would eliminate the bureaucracy that comes with existing accrediting agencies and focus specifically on the needs of public universities.\n\n\n“The Commission for Public Higher Education will offer an accreditation model that prioritizes academic excellence and student success while removing ideological bias and unnecessary financial burdens,” he said. “Through the CPHE, public colleges and universities across the country will have access to an accreditation process that is focused on quality, rooted in accountability and committed to continuous improvement.”\n\n\nBut before voting in favor of the motion, board members repeatedly pushed back, arguing that the plans for starting an accreditor from scratch were half-baked.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: As Harvard and Trump Head to Court, the Government Piles on the Pressure\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/us/harvard-trump-head-to-trial.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement served subpoenas to Harvard with sprawling demands that included payroll records, years of disciplinary files and any videos Harvard had of international students protesting on campus since 2020, according to two people familiar with the subpoenas, some of which were reviewed by The New York Times. The agency gave the university a breakneck one-week deadline for compliance.\n\n\nAlso this month, the administration formally accused the school of civil rights violations, arguing that Harvard had failed to protect Jewish people on campus. The government also complained to the university’s accreditor, which could eventually jeopardize Harvard students’ access to federal financial aid.\n\n\nHarvard leaders are well aware that a long fight with the government is perilous, threatening jobs, projects, reputations and academic independence. Some inside the university have feared that civil inquiries could become criminal matters.\n\n\nBefore the lawsuit, the administration sent Harvard an extraordinary list of conditions, including new policies on hiring, admissions and faculty influence, compulsory reports to the government and audits of academic programs and departments. Since then, although officials acknowledged that sending the letter was a mistake, the government has barely budged from the demands.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia and Trump Near a Deal, With School Possibly Paying Millions\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/11/nyregion/columbia-university-trump-deal-antisemitism.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe existence of a potential deal was confirmed by a third person, who, like the others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive negotiations.\n\n(Methinks this may be a planted story to put pressure on Columbia, but what do I know.)\n\nA university spokeswoman on Friday night did not confirm details of the deal or the potential White House meeting. “The university is focused on advancing the discussions with the federal government. There is no resolution at this time,” the spokeswoman, Virginia Lam Abrams, said.\n\n\nThe deal could include $200 million or more in compensation paid by Columbia for alleged civil rights violations. Columbia officials are expected to meet with Trump aides next week at the White House to finalize the deal, said one of the people familiar with the discussions.\n\n\nAnd Harvard, despite its litigation, has also restarted talks with the Trump administration regarding the return of billions of dollars in federal research funding that have been cut.\n\n\nThe current draft of the deal, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and The Free Beacon, does not go as far in exerting federal authority over the university as an earlier version that was circulated in April.\n\n\nThe negotiations with Columbia have been directed out of the White House by a team led by a Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, with additional involvement of an interagency task force on antisemitism.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-columbia-civil-rights-settlement-86f64531\nhttps://freebeacon.com/campus/columbia-nears-deal-with-trump-administration-university-will-pay-discrimination-victims-reveal-more-admissions-and-hiring-data-but-will-dodge-harsher-measures-like-governance-shakeup/\n(From Wikipedia “The New York Times credited the Free Beacon with breaking, together with Chris Rufo,[23] and subsequently expanding, reportage on the plagiarism accusations against Harvard President Claudine Gay” which is about the nicest way to say they made mountains out of mole hills)\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Expands Efforts to Fight Antisemitism as Trump Deal Seems Near\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/15/nyregion/columbia-plan-to-fight-antisemitism.html\n\nMs. Shipman announced that the changes would include formally incorporating the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism into the work of a recently established office at Columbia that considers complaints of discrimination and discriminatory harassment.\n\n\nIn addition, Columbia will appoint two new coordinators to oversee investigations into claims of discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Those coordinators will produce a publicly available report each year about discrimination investigations and their results.\n\n\nThe university will also institute new educational programs about antisemitism for students and faculty and staff members, including those developed by national organizations such as Project Shema, a training and support organization, and the Anti-Defamation League. And it will reaffirm that it has zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment based on protected traits, including Jewish and Israeli identity.\n\n\nJoseph Howley, a professor of classics and supporter of the pro-Palestinian movement on campus, was critical for different reasons. The definition of antisemitism being adopted by the university, he said, “is not informed by scholarly expertise or even best practice. So it’s not the best framework for confronting hate speech, and it’s not going to solve real problems of discrimination or harassment.”\n\n\nAnti-Semitism Gets the DEI Treatment - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/07/columbia-anti-semitism-trump/683586/\n\nTo do the same thing over and over and expect a different result is one definition of insanity. According to Robert Shibley, a special counsel of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), it’s also Columbia University’s approach to addressing anti-Semitism on campus.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Claire Shipman, Columbia’s acting president, announced in an email to the community that the university would take several steps to quell anti-Semitism on campus. Columbia will appoint Title VI and Title VII coordinators to review allegations of discrimination. It will launch new programming around anti-Jewish discrimination, send out regular messages affirming its zero-tolerance policy on hate, and use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of anti-Semitism for certain disciplinary proceedings. In her message, Shipman promised that the university would continue making reforms until it had stamped out anti-Semitism. “In a recent discussion, a faculty member and I agreed that anti-Semitism at this institution has existed, perhaps less overtly, for a long while, and the work of dismantling it, especially through education and understanding, will take time,” she wrote.\n\n\nThe message was notable for how closely it resembled the communications that university presidents have previously sent out about other forms of discrimination. Replace the references to “anti-Semitism” with “racism,” and Shipman’s message could practically have been lifted from the statements of summer 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy attack colleges? To open students’ minds or blow up institutions?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/07/16/trump-dei-george-mason-university/\n\nNow, the mission has gone off the rails: The Trump administration is coming for George Mason University, one of Virginia’s largest colleges, which has done more than almost any other campus in the country to become conservative-friendly.\n\n\nSadly, George Mason’s course will likely be determined not by its president or faculty, but by politicians in Richmond and judges in courtrooms. A Fairfax County judge is expected to rule later this month on a move by Democrats in the Virginia Senate to block approval of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s (R) nominees to the school’s board. And when Virginia voters choose a new governor this fall, they will be deciding who gets to nominate board members next year.\n\n\nThere was a time, not long ago, when governance of public universities was a bipartisan effort, devoted to building civic knowledge and advancing the skills of the next generation. Politics and culture wars weren’t the primary focus.\n\n\nwe have unthinking attacks on any and all colleges — another example of government gone wild. Trump campaigned last year on smacking down elite colleges’ “Marxist assault on our American heritage and Western civilization itself.” What’s he delivering, perversely enough, is his own reactionary assault on the institutions that transmit our heritage to the inheritors of our democracy.\n\n\nGeorge Mason President Defends Univ. Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/18/gmu-president-responds-civil-rights-investigation\n\n“I can assure you that George Mason has always operated with a commitment to equality under the law, ever since our inception,” he wrote. ”It is simply the Mason way, and in my experience, it has not discriminated based on race, color, national origin, or otherwise. Our diversity efforts are designed to expand opportunity and build inclusive excellence—not to exclude or advantage any group unlawfully.”\n\n\nHe offered a brief history of Title VI—which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in federally funded programs—and the rest of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Then, without naming any names, he essentially accused the Trump administration of willfully misinterpreting the law.\n\n\n“Today, we are seeing a profound shift in how Title VI is being applied,” he wrote. “Longstanding efforts to address inequality—such as mentoring programs, inclusive hiring practices, and support for historically underrepresented groups—are in many cases being reinterpreted as presumptively unlawful. Broad terms like ‘illegal DEI’ are now used without definition, allowing virtually any initiative that touches on identity or inclusion to be painted as discriminatory.\n\n\nTrump administration expands scrutiny of George Mason University\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/17/george-mason-doj-investigation/\n\nThe investigation [into the alleged use of race in hiring and promotions at George Mason University ] is the third launched by the administration in recent weeks into the policies and practices at the Northern Virginia university, and the first inquiry into the school led by the Justice Department.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs U-Va. president leaves, faculty say board failed to protect university\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/11/university-of-virginia-faculty-board-no-confidence-ryan/\n\nUniversity of Virginia faculty passed a vote of no confidence Friday in the school’s governing body, saying it failed to protect against “outside interference” by the Trump administration that led to the eventual resignation of President James E. Ryan.\n\n\nThe vote by the U-Va. faculty senate — which came on Ryan’s last day in office — called on the board to provide faculty with an “immediate and complete accounting” of its response to inquiries by the Justice Department in recent months.\n\n\nThe board leaders also said the Justice Department investigations were ongoing and that they would work hard to reach a voluntary settlement with the Trump administration as soon as they could.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Hiring: Title VI Coordinators\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/diversity/2025/07/14/colleges-hire-title-vi-coordinators-amid-federal-scrutiny\n\nin fiscal year 2022, before the Israel-Hamas war began, allegations of Title VI violations made up only 17.3 percent of the complaints OCR received, in comparison with Title XI (49.2 percent) and the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 (33.4 percent), which protect against disability discrimination.\n\n\nThe number of Title VI complaints increased 29.4 percent over the next two years. Complaints related to shared ancestry increased sevenfold from 2023 to 2024.\n\n\nIn other cases, it was a proactive step. In April, the State University of New York system, the largest public college system in the nation, required each of its campuses to bring on a Title VI coordinator by fall 2025.\n\n\n“We really have tried to be very thoughtful about ensuring that all of our campuses are safe and supportive environments free from harassment and discrimination. We take Title IX enforcement seriously,” said SUNY chancellor John B. King in an interview.",

But his move to Washington cost him an incredible $300 million.\n\n\n“I joined the Nvidia board in 2004, before the company took off, but I had to sell my shares in 2009 when I joined government,” Chu said about his early involvement in the microchip firm that recently became the world’s most valuable company with a $4 trillion capitalization.\n\n\nSanguine about his lost wealth, Chu’s main takeaway from Nvidia is not his own misfortune. Instead, he worries that this American success story—co-created by a Taiwanese-born Stanford graduate, employing foreign-born engineering talent—might not have been able to happen today given the double whammy faced by U.S. academia: massive cuts to federal science budgets and an immigration crackdown deterring many students, particularly from China, from applying to U.S. institutions.\n\n\nWithout America’s outstanding universities and with its foreign talent pool diminished, China’s path to global dominance will be immeasurably easier, predicted Chu. “Trump is perfectly willing to destroy institutions that any country in the world would give its eyeteeth for,” he said.",

    "text": "What Happens After A.I. Destroys College Writing?\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/07/the-end-of-the-english-paper\n\nHe opened Claude on his laptop. I noticed a chat that mentioned abolition. “We had to read Robert Wedderburn for a class,” he explained, referring to the nineteenth-century Jamaican abolitionist. “But, obviously, I wasn’t tryin’ to read that.” He had prompted Claude for a summary, but it was too long for him to read in the ten minutes he had before class started. He told me, “I said, ‘Turn it into concise bullet points.’” He then transcribed Claude’s points in his notebook, since his professor ran a screen-free classroom.\n\n\nI teach at a small liberal-arts college, and I often joke that a student is more likely to hand in a big paper a year late (as recently happened) than to take a dishonorable shortcut.\n\n\nThere are no reliable figures for how many American students use A.I., just stories about how everyone is doing it. A 2024 Pew Research Center survey of students between the ages of thirteen and seventeen suggests that a quarter of teens currently use ChatGPT for schoolwork, double the figure from 2023. OpenAI recently released a report claiming that one in three college students uses its products. There’s good reason to believe that these are low estimates.\n\n\nCorey Robin, a writer and a professor of political science at Brooklyn College, read the early stories about ChatGPT with skepticism. Then his daughter, a sophomore in high school at the time, used it to produce an essay that was about as good as those his undergraduates wrote after a semester of work. He decided to stop assigning take-home essays. For the first time in his thirty years of teaching, he administered in-class exams.\n\n\nBarry Lam teaches in the philosophy department at the University of California, Riverside, and hosts a popular podcast, Hi-Phi Nation, which applies philosophical modes of inquiry to everyday topics. He began wondering what it would mean for A.I. to actually be a productivity tool. … If students were learning things faster, then it stood to reason that Lam could assign them “something very hard.” He wanted to test this theory, so for final exams he gave his undergraduates a Ph.D.-level question involving denotative language and the German logician Gottlob Frege which was, frankly, beyond me.\n\n\n“They fucking failed it miserably,” he said. He adjusted his grading curve accordingly.\n\n\nWhen classes were over and students were moving into their summer housing, I e-mailed with Alex, who was settling in in the East Village. He’d just finished his finals, and estimated that he’d spent between thirty minutes and an hour composing two papers for his humanities classes. Without the assistance of Claude, it might have taken him around eight or nine hours. “I didn’t retain anything,” he wrote. “I couldn’t tell you the thesis for either paper hahhahaha.” He received an A-minus and a B-plus. ♦\n\n\nNYTimes: I’m Watching the Sacrifice of College’s Soul\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/opinion/college-soul-ai-education.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAnd perhaps a certain idea of college — a certain ideal of college — is dying. I [Frank Bruni] keep coming back to that possibility, which seems more like a probability since President Trump returned to the White House and began his assault on higher education.\n\n\nWhat happened to college as a theater of intellectual betterment, character development, self-discovery? Easy A’s work against that, replacing rigor with ready affirmation. A.I. also works against that: Why spend hour upon hour synthesizing knowledge when a few keystrokes will do the trick? And measuring schools by their financial return on students’ investments … occludes higher education’s other important functions. Colleges are supposed to nurture nimble thinkers. They’re meant to produce informed and enlightened citizens who are better equipped to leaven passion with reason. There’s a deficit of those now, as ominous as any budgetary shortfall.\n\n\nZimmerman [renowned historian of education at the University of Pennsylvania] said. “We continue to tell a story about the mind-expanding purpose and qualities of a university, and no doubt some people who come here experience that mind expansion. The problem is that all of the other cultural and social signals around them are pointing them in the other direction.”\n\n\nThe moral of those two stories is that the smartest approach to college may be precisely the one that its trajectory of late has conspired against: range widely across subject offerings and focus not on a skill that could become obsolete but on intellectual dexterity and powers of judgment with better odds of enduring relevance. “A liberal arts degree is a preprofessional degree — you just don’t know what the profession is,” said Zimmerman, who teaches a seminar for first-year students at U. Penn. called “Why College?”\n\n\nBut higher education as a blessing independent of any instantly redeemable credential bucks the zeitgeist. Under Trump, blunt materialism reigns, and such concepts as human rights, diplomacy and even democracy are suspect, the precious preoccupation of idealistic chumps. Do anthropology, philosophy and history stand a chance?\n\n\nWhite House officials are preparing an executive order targeting tech companies with what they see as “woke” artificial-intelligence models, their latest effort to go after diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/white-house-prepares-executive-order-targeting-woke-ai-e68e8e24?st=eqQBGd&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(As Krugman noted in a recent newsletter: “So in modern Republican rhetoric, anything to the left of MAGA ideology is communist extremism. And here’s the thing: The answers you get from AI generally don’t adhere to the right-wing party line. … it all goes back to Stephen Colbert’s dictum, almost 20 years ago, that “reality has a well-known liberal bias.” )\n\nThe order would dictate that AI companies getting federal contracts be politically neutral and unbiased in their AI models, an effort to combat what administration officials see as liberal bias in some models, the people said.\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

This theory bases academic freedom not on freedom of speech—a troublesome basis for academic freedom—but on the university’s corporate rights. These corporate rights, not infrequently finding expression in constitutions, are also sometimes constitutional rights. By substituting corporate rights for freedom of speech, we turn a foundation of sand into stone.\n\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that, in spring 2025, we may have entered the nadir of American academic freedom. Austin Sarat rightfully urged us, even before then, to find new ways to guard academic freedom “against external threats.” Now, in the face of ongoing hostility from both state and federal governments, it is imperative that universities deploy the full range of arguments at their disposal, including those based on their forgotten corporate rights. In other words, it’s time for universities to invoke their corporate rights. Allow me to explain.\n\n\n“Incorporation,” David Ciepley has written, “is a powerful tool.” Corporations can sue and be sued in their own names, hold property, enter contracts, use their own seals and legislate. Importantly, the university’s corporateness bears no necessary relationship to its current autocratic constitution, whereby, according to Timothy V. Kaufman-Osborn, universities are “ruled by external lay governing boards vested with the panoply of powers customarily granted to corporations, including the power to adopt, amend, and revoke its basic rules of institutional governance.” Thus, we can use the university’s corporateness to rebuff external attacks, while also working, as Arjun Appadurai wrote recently, “to break the unilateral power of boards of trustees.”\n\n\n\n\necretly Recorded by Anti-DEI Group, ‘No Longer Employed’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/2025/06/30/secretly-recorded-anti-dei-group-now-no-longer-employed\n\nhe YouTube video is titled “CAUGHT ON TAPE: UNC Administrator Admits They Ignore DEI Ban.” Heart-pumping music plays.

But in an email on Monday, the Education Department notified state education agencies that the money would not be available.\n\n\nMany school districts also rely on federal dollars to help non-English-speaking students and families, including training teachers and hiring translators.\n\n\nA Decades-Old Government Program That Supports Hispanic Students Is Under Fresh Scrutiny\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-decades-old-government-program-for-supporting-hispanic-students-is-under-fresh-scrutiny\n\nFor 30 years, colleges enrolling a certain share of Hispanic students have been able to secure a title that opens up millions in federal funding. Hundreds of them now qualify as Hispanic-serving institutions, or HSIs.\n\n\nBut those programs are now in the line of fire.\n\n\nThe U.S. Education Department doled out about $350 million to Hispanic-serving institutions in the 2024 fiscal year across three competitive grant programs; the National Science Foundation awarded another $53.5 million. Colleges can become eligible when at least 25 percent of their undergraduate students identify as Hispanic or Latino/a.\n\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions, the group responsible for the lawsuit that ended race-conscious admissions policies at selective colleges in 2023, has brought a new complaint in Tennessee arguing that federal funding designated solely for HSIs is discriminatory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChinese Students’ Vulnerable Status Has a History — and an Impact on the Future\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/chinese-students-vulnerable-status-has-a-history-and-an-impact-on-the-future\n\n“It does seem that Chinese students are being used as bargaining chips in the trade negotiations with China,” said Jonathan Bean, a research fellow at the Independent Institute and a professor of history at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.\n\n\n“It would be devastating. You really can’t run labs without these graduate students. You really can’t run these large courses,” said Wu. “The entire model of how universities run in the U.S. is at risk if we lose the supply of international students.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDOGE loses control over government grants website, freeing up billions\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/27/doge-loses-control-federal-grants/\n\nThree months ago, DOGE employees wrested control of a key federal grants website, grants.gov, which serves as a clearinghouse for more than $500 billion in annual awards, The Post reported. For most of the program’s existence, federal agencies including the Defense Department posted their funding opportunities directly to the site, where thousands of outside organizations could see and apply for them — until April, when DOGE staffers changed the website’s permissions to give themselves power to review and approve all grants across the government.\n\n\nBut on Thursday, federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, according to emails obtained by The Post and the two people, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive situation. The decision follows fears that months of DOGE-linked delays would lead to what critics allege would be the illegal impoundment of federal funds.\n\n\nPSC, higher-ed unions slam federal research funding cuts\n\nhttps://thechiefleader.com/stories/psc-higher-ed-unions-slam-federal-research-funding-cuts,54668\n\nResearchers at the city and state’s public universities affected by cuts to federal grant funding urged the state’s congressional leaders to oppose further cuts to funding proposed in President Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”\n\n\nMembers of the Professional Staff Congress, the New York State United Teachers and other higher-education advocates rallied against the existing and proposed funding reductions outside of the Trump Building at 40 Wall St. Monday.\n\n\nAt the City University of New York, 70 grants worth $17 million in funding have been slashed, which has put 100 jobs at risk, according to the PSC. And at SUNY, there have been $50 million in grant terminations.\n\n\nThe PSC’s president, James Davis, called the cuts to SUNY and CUNY “an outrage,” adding that cuts to research could delay life-saving medical treatments.\n\n\nKathleen Cumiskey, a psychology professor at the College of Staten Island who has worked at CUNY for 22 years, said that a $700,000 National Science Foundation grant for a three-year STEM education program aimed at improving academic outcomes at Hispanic-serving institutions was terminated on May 2, just 20 months into the program’s lifespan.\n\n\n“We believe the decision to terminate our grant was unfair. Unfortunately, under the current administration, it appears that the agency has been redirected in ways that threaten our nation’s scientific discovery and the importance of broad participation in the creation of new knowledge,” Cumiskey said.\n\n\nCity Comptroller Brad Lander joined the researchers, noting that higher education contributes $35 billion to the city’s economy and employs about 140,000 people.\n\n\n\n\nStalled funding, canceled grants: How the NIH crisis is affecting Duke - The Chronicle\n\nhttps://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2025/06/duke-university-national-institutes-of-health-cut-cancel-duke-research-nih-federal-funding-grants-trump-administrations\n\nDuke receives around $1.2 billion in research grants a year, and much of it comes from the NIH. In fiscal year 2024 NIH support totaled $580 million.\n\n\n“Most of the time, that’s a point of pride, a marker of success, but it’s also a point of challenge when that fundamental model is changing. This is what we’re dealing with now,” said Mary Klotman, executive vice president for health affairs and dean of the School of Medicine\n\n\nGrant Watch contains a field for “tagged_words” — which matches words from a list that The New York Times reported could trigger an automatic review of grants — to words used in a grant’s title or abstract. Noam Ross, a computational researcher part of Grant Watch, told The Chronicle that Grant Watch doesn’t know exactly how grants are flagged for termination, but “suspect that these words are part of a search process for selecting them based on [The New York Times article] and other reporting.”\n\n\nThe 15 canceled NIH grants contained flagged words like “expression,” “disability,” “trans” and “systemic.” However, these words were not used in contexts to promote DEI initiatives, although some may have had diversity supplements including the two described below.\n\n\nThe grant that had the word “disability” in its abstract focused on identifying biomechanical and biological factors that lead to early onset osteoarthritis following a partial meniscectomy — a surgical procedure commonly done to remove damaged meniscal tissue following a tear. The grant had over $750,000 remaining in funding at the time of termination.\n\n\nFurthermore, a grant that had both “trans” and “systemic” in its abstract was working toward editing neural circuits by engineering channel proteins to control the point of contact between two neurons. It had around $1.4 million remaining in funding at the time of termination.\n\n\nIn most other cases where “trans” was flagged, the term generally referred to other words with the trans- prefix, such as disease transmission, transgenic genetic material, translational studies or signal transduction.\n\n\nMost notably, the NIH ended Duke’s Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development, which was a $129 million program and a leader in its field. The program was in its sixth year of funding out of seven and was largely expected to be renewed for an additional cycle. Associated funding has not been listed as terminated in federal databases and thus was not included in the Grant Watch data analysis.\n\n\nThe Scientific Research Lost Amid the Trump Administration’s NIH Cuts — ProPublica\n\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/nih-cuts-research-lost-trump/\n\n\n\n\nE.P.A.

The Senate legislation underwent significant changes in the week leading up to its passage, several of which softened provisions in the House bill that had raised alarms across the sector. The Senate retained the House’s broad plan to raise the endowment tax, for example, but it limited the extent of the hike and opened up loopholes for small institutions.\n\n\nSenators abandoned a House plan to eliminate subsidized federal undergraduate loans. Also out: a House provision that would have required students to take 30 credit hours per academic year to receive the maximum Pell Grant award, and 15 credit hours to be eligible for Pell Grants at all. Community colleges were particularly panicked about the provision.\n\n\nThe Senate kiboshed a controversial risk-sharing plan introduced in the House bill, which would have forced colleges to kick money into a new pot of federal aid when their students defaulted on federal-loan repayment. Instead, it offered an alternative approach with roots in the gainful-employment rule, a cornerstone of the Obama administration’s accountability efforts.\n\n\nThe Senate-passed plan would yank federal-loan eligibility from programs that fail to deliver an earnings bump to their graduates. Senators tweaked the details in the days leading up to Tuesday’s vote so colleges would be judged on the earnings of their graduates, not dropouts.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy UVA President’s Resignation Could Be a ‘Watershed Moment’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/executive-leadership/2025/06/30/uva-reels-after-president-resigns-under-pressure\n\n“I think this is a watershed moment,” said Jon Holbein, an associate professor of public policy, politics and education at UVA. “If a moderate president at a conservative–for–higher education institution who has followed the law when it comes to diversity [can be pushed out], no president is immune from the Trump administration’s ire.”\n\n\nUVA faculty, some board members, students and community say Ryan’s departure is a blow to the institution. “His loss makes us worse,” said Michael Kennedy, a UVA professor and faculty representative on the Board of Visitors, describing Ryan as a “shattering success.”\n\n\nThe Jefferson Council, a conservative alumni group that publicly called for Ryan’s resignation, called the DEI efforts exclusive, discriminatory and “the new McCarthyism.”\n\n(I think that used to be called doublespeak; this organization seems to have been founded by someone who in March had this news: Youngkin fires Bert Ellis from University of Virginia Board of Visitors))\n\nThe U. of Virginia’s President Was Targeted Over DEI. Now He’s Resigning.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/university-of-virginia-president-reportedly-resigns-under-pressure-from-trump-administration\n\nPeter McDonough, vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education, called the government’s handling of the matter “a potentially ominous effort to control a learning environment it finds objectionable.”\n\n\n“This is unprecedented,” McDonough said in an interview. “Maybe we should have seen it coming.”\n\n\nDhillon said that the department had told UVa representatives that the government “lacked confidence” in Ryan, given his “participation in groups” that had publicly opposed the Trump administration’s policies. (Ryan, along with hundreds of other college presidents, signed a letter condemning “unprecedented government overreach” in higher education.)\n\n\nNYTimes: What the University of Virginia Should Have Done\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/30/opinion/university-of-virginia-doj-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUnder investigation by the Justice Department, the university had a strong defense, if only it had the courage to assert it. Instead of fighting back against what I believe to be false accusations that the university was violating federal law, and the even more outrageous demand that Mr. Ryan resign as a remedy for those alleged violations, the university’s Board of Visitors pushed out a popular president. Instead of presenting facts and law, the board waved the white flag of surrender. Mr. Ryan’s resignation is a victory for intimidation and fear over the rule of law.\n\n\nI served as university counsel at the University of Virginia from 2018 through 2022. During that time, it was my job to defend the university from unfounded allegations and investigations. The Justice Department has alleged that the university’s actions violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which states, “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” Had I been university counsel last week, I would have advised my client to challenge what I believe to be a false allegation that the university’s policies are unlawful.\n\n\nTitle VI prohibits racial classifications, quotas or programs that are exclusive to any one race, gender or protected class. It does not prevent federal contractors, such as universities, from pursuing the goal of creating a diverse community, one that ensures all individuals can participate in the learning environment regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, national origin or political ideology. Eligibility for programs and opportunities based on those and other immutable characteristics is illegal. Programs that create a pipeline of diverse applicants are not.\n\n\nWhile the university’s compliance with Title VI is clear to me, it was challenged by the Justice Department. Informed by the advocacy of the America First Legal Foundation, an organization founded by the current White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, the department alleged that the university’s compliance efforts were insufficient, a mere relabeling of D.E.I. programs that broke the law. The department’s proposed remedy was the resignation of the university’s leader — a shocking move that reveals the personal animus behind the investigation. The administration would rather oust a leader than force compliance with a particular policy.\n\n\nWhy? By law, the university and all state agencies are represented by the attorney general of Virginia. The current attorney general has been an outspoken opponent of D.E.I. programs. He joined Virginia’s governor, Glenn Youngkin, in applauding the university’s dismantling of D.E.I. programs in March 2025. This means rather than having an advocate loyal to the university and its interests, Mr. Ryan and the university were saddled with counsel aligned with the other side.\n\n\nThe university’s governing board took a similar position. The majority of the current board was appointed by Mr. Youngkin, who has said, “D.E.I. is done at the University of Virginia.” In failing to assert these valid legal defenses, the board abdicated its responsibility to protect the university and defend it against unfounded allegations.\n\n\nMr. Ryan was known to urge the university to be both “great and good” in all its endeavors. His departure will result in a less inclusive university community, which will harm all students who choose the University of Virginia. It is a sad day for the university, which will suffer the consequences of this bad decision.\n\n\nNew York City Tech/CUNY one of the highlighted BA degree granting institutions whose faculty are increasingly integrated—race/ethnicity non-white.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-is-the-share-of-minority-instructors-at-colleges-with-the-most-full-time-faculty-members\n(VAC says: This interesting graph explains too the attacks from this fed administration on higher ed)\n\n\n\nWhat a Harvard Deal Would Mean for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-a-harvard-deal-would-mean-for-higher-ed\n\nIn the absence of more information, some faculty members within Harvard are fearful that the government isn’t negotiating in good faith, and that any agreement would only open the door to an unlawful power grab — although not everyone is so pessimistic.

Garber, on Monday, officials from four federal agencies said that the university was “in violent violation of Title VI,” a portion of federal civil rights law that bars discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin. In recent years, government officials have interpreted the provision to include “shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics” as within the law’s protections.\n\n\nIn their letter, the Trump administration officials said that Harvard’s “commitment to racial hierarchies” had “enabled antisemitism to fester” at the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university. They warned that not making “adequate changes immediately will result in the loss of all federal financial resources and continue to affect Harvard’s relationship with the federal government.”\n\n\nHarvard sharply disputed the government’s account, saying in a statement on Monday that antisemitism was “a serious problem” that the school had taken significant steps to address. The university added that it was “far from indifferent on this issue” and that it “strongly disagrees with the government’s findings.”\n\n\nBut Paula M. Stannard, the director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a separate letter on Monday that Harvard’s varied steps to combat antisemitism, such as the development of a faculty panel to investigate and discipline people in connection with certain accusations of misconduct, were “too little, too late.”\n\n\nAccording to Ms. Stannard, “Jewish and Israeli students at Harvard University were subject to severe, pervasive and objectively offensive harassment from Oct. 7, 2023, through the present.”\n\n(Add Paula M Stannard to your bingo card)\n\nThe Trump administration found Harvard violated the civil rights of Jewish and Israeli students, putting the university’s federal funding further at risk\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-violated-students-civil-rights-trump-administration-finds-4a0ed7aa?st=UNno8L&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nA formal “notice of violation” of civil-rights law generally is a step that can come before either a lawsuit from the Justice Department or a voluntary resolution with the school.

Can it survive a Trump standoff?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/01/harvard-trump-federal-funding/\n\n“With its resources and an AAA bond rating, Harvard has financial freedom and flexibility. Still, these headwinds, and there are a lot of them, are piling up all at once,” said Howard Bunsis, an accounting professor at Eastern Michigan University.\n\n\nSince the federal government began demanding the university change how it operates in April, Harvard has lost more than $2 billion in federal funding.\n\n\nBut the university has limited access to its endowment and already depends on it for a significant portion of its operating budget. And about 80 percent of Harvard’s endowment, a collection of 14,000 funds, is restricted to uses that donors stipulate, and the university cannot change the terms of those gifts — some dating back to the founding of the school — on its own.\n\n\nHarvard has about $8.2 billion in unfunded private equity commitments coming due in the near term, said Michael Markov, co-founder and chairman of the research firm Markov Processes International. Finding the money to cover those kinds of commitments could put tremendous pressure on universities with large private equity stakes, he said.\n\n\n“It’s just this perfect storm of academic freedom in the crosshairs at the same time that the universities are vulnerable because of the financial uncertainties associated with their endowments and their private equity investments,” he [Philip Casey, founder and chief executive of Institutional LPs] said.\n\n\nHarvard would face a budget shortfall of about a billion dollars a year if President Trump follows through on all of his plans and threats spanning research funding, tax policy and student enrollment\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-trump-funding-budget-cuts-1dc5bf2f?st=H5Jdr2&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(Has an excellent graphic “Harvard’s 2024 revenue and worst-case scenario losses” showing losses: -240M for endowment (of 2.4B), -700M federally funded research (max amount), -110M grad school (of 800M) )\n\nHarvard University would face a budget shortfall of about a billion dollars a year if President Trump follows through on all of his plans and threats spanning research funding, tax policy and student enrollment, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\nThat grim math helps explain why Harvard has taken steps toward negotiating with the administration after months of defiance.

The Trump administration has said that Columbia violated federal civil rights laws and is thus out of compliance with the accreditor’s standards. But only accreditors can say whether a college is in compliance. Middle States had already opened a review of Columbia before the department’s notice, conducting an on-site evaluation in April.\n\n\nMiddle States said in the warning that it doesn’t have sufficient evidence showing Columbia is complying with its standard on ethics and integrity. The criteria for that standard includes “a climate that fosters respect among students, faculty, staff, and administration from a range of diverse backgrounds, ideas, and perspectives” and “compliance with all applicable government laws and regulations.” The accreditor requested a monitoring report, due by Nov. 3, that demonstrates the university’s compliance with the standard, and will consider Columbia’s accreditation status at a March 2026 meeting. Columbia remains accredited in the meantime.\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Cyberattack Appears Politically Motivated, University Says\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/nyregion/columbia-university-hacker.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(trigger alert; graphic image accompanies article)\n\nThe cyberattack that caused a widespread shutdown of Columbia University’s computer systems last week appears to be the work of a “hacktivist” — a hacker who also stole student data with the apparent goal of furthering a political agenda, a Columbia official said on Tuesday.\n\n\nA cyber-forensics firm hired by the university reported that the hack appeared to be highly sophisticated and targeted in its theft of documents, the official said. The official added that Columbia had not yet determined the scope of the data theft and that it could take weeks to months to do so. Columbia’s websites and internal systems, however, which went down during the attack, were up and running again within a week.\n\n\nThe person who communicated with Bloomberg News provided it with 1.6 gigabytes of data representing 2.5 million student applications to Columbia dating back decades. The data included students’ and applicants’ university-issued identification numbers, their citizenship status, the decisions made on their applications and the academic programs to which they applied, among other information.\n\n\nBloomberg reported that it was able to confirm the accuracy of the data for eight Columbia students and alumni who applied to the university between 2019 and 2024.\n\n\nColumbia was attacked about a week after its chief information officer, Gaspare LoDuca, announced that he was leaving the university and joining M.I.T. as its vice president for information systems and technology.

Thanks VAC for sharing.)\n\nIndiana’s public higher education institutions plan to eliminate or consolidate over 400 programs, equaling roughly one-fifth of their degree offerings statewide, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education said Monday. The announcement came just before a new state law took effect Tuesday setting minimum requirements for how many graduates individual programs must produce at the universities and Ivy Tech Community College, or face termination.\n\n\nRepublican state legislators passed the law—a state budget bill with major higher education provisions tacked on—less than two days after revealing it in April. It says institutions can ask the commission for approval to keep offering degrees that don’t meet the threshold of average annual graduates. But the universities “voluntarily submitted” the first wave of hundreds of programs to be ended or consolidated, the commission said, meaning they didn’t ask for exemptions.\n\n\nAccording to a list posted by the commission, among the 400 degrees to be nixed or combined into others are many foreign language and teacher-education programs. The list also includes undergraduate and graduate degrees in fine arts, English, business, economics, philosophy, history, anthropology, sociology, journalism, public administration, social work, labor studies, political science, American studies, Africana studies, women’s and gender studies, religious studies, and classical studies.\n\n\nSTEM and medical disciplines aren’t being spared, either; the eliminated or consolidated degrees include some in health, biology, chemistry, math, computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. Indiana University at Bloomington, for instance, is ending its Ph.D. in astrophysics. More than half the programs to be eliminated or merged are in the IU system. Vincennes University is the only public institution in the state that didn’t “voluntarily” submit programs to be cut or combined.\n\n\nIndiana’s program slashing can be seen as another consequence of the broader push by red states’ legislatures to intervene in higher education by restricting teaching, attacking tenure and, now, dictating curricula.\n\n\nHeather Akou, the president-elect of the IU Bloomington Faculty Council, said the council didn’t get to vote on these “draconian” cuts and mergers at the flagship campus. “Not only did we not vote, we were not even consulted with,” Akou said.\n\n\nBalthaser, the IU South Bend AAUP member, said, “This was done very intentionally to essentially change the mission of the university—to shrink it, to essentially destroy what we understand as the public [land-grant] university.”\n\n\n\n\n\nUPenn Agrees to Ban Transgender Athletes in Women’s Sports, Correct Records | National Review\n\nhttps://www.nationalreview.com/news/upenn-agrees-to-ban-transgender-athletes-in-womens-sports-correct-records/\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/01/penn-agrees-trumps-demands-will-strip-trans-athletes?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed&utm_campaign=e64fe0d91e-DNU_2021_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1fcbc04421-e64fe0d91e-236791398&mc_cid=e64fe0d91e&mc_eid=7f06c26dc8#\n(From VAC)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/us/penn-title-ix-transgender-swimmer-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania said on Tuesday that it had struck a deal with the federal government that will limit how transgender people may participate in its athletic programs, bowing to the Trump administration’s new interpretation of the law that bans sex discrimination in education.\n\n\nThe agreement was tied to a civil rights investigation, conducted by the Department of Education, of a transgender woman’s participation on Penn’s women’s swim team three years ago. In April, the Education Department said that Penn’s support for the swimmer, Lia Thomas, had violated the law governing sex discrimination in most educational settings.\n\n\nPenn’s president, J. Larry Jameson, noted in a statement on Tuesday that the university had been in compliance with the interpretation of federal law that was in effect when Ms. Thomas swam there. But he said that the Trump administration’s inquiry had left Penn vulnerable to “significant and lasting implications,” a reference to the possibility of a loss of federal funding.\n\n\n\n\n\nUVirginia President resigns under pressure from Trump DOJ\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/27/us/politics/university-of-virginia-president-resigns-trump-justice-department.html\n(Thanks VAC, who is counting scalps)\n\nThe University of Virginia’s president, James E. Ryan, has told the board overseeing the school that he will resign in the face of demands by the Trump administration that he step aside to help resolve a Justice Department inquiry into the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, according to three people briefed on the matter.\n\n\nFor the leader of one of the nation’s most prominent public universities to take such an extraordinary step demonstrates President Trump’s success in harnessing the investigative powers of the federal government to accomplish his administration’s policy goals.\n\n(Harnessing = weaponizing by another name to this group: Gregory Brown, Harmeet Dhillon, Stephen Miller)\n\nThe University of Virginia has been considered among the top five public universities for more than two decades, according to U.S. News & World Report rankings, and has maintained that position during Mr. Ryan’s tenure. This year, the Princeton Review ranked the university as the second-best value among all public colleges. Last year, Time magazine ranked the college as the fourth-best public school at producing future leaders.\n\n(WSJ reporting)\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/uva-president-resigns-james-ryan-dei-trump-d02a60fe?st=Ce97ks&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(The letter Ryan sent to the University)\n\nTo the University community:\n\n\nI am writing, with a very heavy heart, to let you know that I have submitted my resignation as President of the University of Virginia. To make a long story short, I am inclined to fight for what I believe in, and I believe deeply in this University. But I cannot make a unilateral decision to fight the federal government in order to save my own job.\n\n\nTo do so would not only be quixotic but appear selfish and self-centered to the hundreds of employees who would lose their jobs, the researchers who would lose their funding, and the hundreds of students who could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld.\n\n\nThis is especially true because I had decided that next year would be my last, for reasons entirely separate from this episode-including the fact that we concluded our capital campaign and have implemented nearly all of the major initiatives in our strategic plan.\n\n\nWhile there are very important principles at play here, I would at a very practical level be fighting to keep my job for one more year while knowingly and willingly sacrificing others in this community. If this were not so distinctly tied to me personally, I may have pursued a different path. But I could not in good conscience cause real and direct harm to my colleagues and our students in order to preserve my own position.\n\n\nIt has been an honor to be your President. Thanks for the outpouring of support over the last few days and weeks.\n\n\nMy deepest gratitude to all of the faculty, staff, students, and alumni, who make this University and this community both great and good. This was an excruciatingly difficult decision, and I am heartbroken to be leaving this way.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nJim Ryan, President\n\n(The pressure was on in at least three areas: research funding, student financial aid, or student visas).\n\nThe Unexpected Trump Target\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-unexpected-trump-target\n\nRyan’s ouster has turned UVa into an unexpected battlefield in the Trump administration’s political assault on colleges. For months, officials have wielded federal power to rebalance what they see as higher ed’s extreme leftward tilt and stamp out diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.\n\n\nHarmeet K. Dhillon, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, sees things differently. Ryan “has built his entire career on what was the academic vogue, which is DEI. Now, it isn’t,” she told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “And so I think it is time for new leadership that’s willing to comply with federal law.”\n\n\nOther faculty members see Ryan’s decision as a submission to political actors who have no inclination or tendency to compromise. The professors wish that Ryan, or the university, had fought back. Deborah McDowell, a professor of English, thinks Ryan should have forced the board to fire him.\n\n\n“Capitulation is sometimes in order,” she said. “For this, I don’t think it was. This is spoken as someone who does not agree and would not represent myself as one in full agreement with the decisions Ryan has made throughout his presidency. I am not. But bullies cannot be placated. They are greedy.”\n\n\nThe targeting of UVa may seem somewhat arbitrary, the result of a random commonality in the curricula vitae of two of the nation’s top civil-rights officials. In May, The Chronicle reported a story teasing out the connections between Dhillon; her deputy, Gregory Brown, who attended UVa as an undergraduate and has sued the institution in the past over a civil-rights issue; the Jefferson Council, the conservative alumni group that has been calling on Ryan to resign for months; and the Board of Visitors.\n\n\nLetters from DOJ reveal threats to U.Va. over admissions policies, Ryan’s leadership - The Cavalier Daily - University of Virginia’s Student Newspaper\n\nhttps://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/07/letters-from-doj-reveal-threats-to-uva-over-admissions-policies-ryans-leadership\n\nBetween April 11 and June 17, the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division sent seven letters to University officials, according to documents obtained by The Cavalier Daily through a Freedom of information Act request.\n\n\nIn these letters, the Justice Department sought confirmation that the University had removed affirmative action from its admissions policies and had ended Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives. Some letters also alleged that the University had failed to protect students against antisemitism. The letters did not confirm whether or not the Justice Department’s demands had been met.\n\n\nApril 11: The first letter was sent by the Justice Department to the University April 11 and requested information regarding the University’s admissions policies. The Justice Department said it aimed to ensure the University was no longer using affirmative action, in accordance with the Supreme Court’s decision in Students for Fair Admissions vs. Harvard in 2023.\n\n\nThe letter requested, among other documents, all admissions data broken down by race and ethnicity for the past five academic years, including applicant test scores, GPA, extracurricular activities, essays and admissions outcomes. It also requested that the University verify that race was not used as a factor in determining any scholarship or financial aid awards to students.\n\n\nJune 17: The final letter turned up in the FOIA request was from June 17. “Time is running short, and the Department’s patience is wearing thin,” the letter read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEurope is wooing American researchers with funding as the Trump administration cancels grants\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/world/europe/europe-is-recruiting-academics-disenchanted-with-america-c4bae422?st=XUZ7ic&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(Now an evergreen story…)\n\nMoody’s Warns of Credit Risk for Colleges Reliant on International Enrollment\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/07/03/drops-international-student-tuition-could-pose\n(CUNY Enrollment doesn’t seem to be impacted as of now; Baruch, City, and GC are trending a bit above last year at the moment.)\n\nThose most at risk include the 11 percent of American institutions where international students make up more than 20 percent of the student body, the ratings agency said, as well as institutions that are already struggling financially. (In total, 6 percent of students at U.S. institutions come from other countries.)\n\n\n“The reduction in international students presents a credit risk for universities heavily reliant on this demographic because of potential declines in tuition income, as international students typically pay full tuition fees,” the report states. “Additionally, with declining numbers of high school students over the next several years in the U.S. leading to fewer domestic students, universities intending to fill the gap with more international students may fall short.”\n\n\nNobelist: U.S. Scientists Took Support ‘For Granted’ Before Trump Cuts\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/07/03/nobelist-scientists-took-support-granted-trump\n\nFrances Arnold, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018 for her work on engineering enzymes, told an audience of young scientists in Germany that the “utter chaos” in U.S. politics of recent months, which has seen billions of dollars removed from scientific research, might be viewed in terms of a wider failure to communicate the value of scientific discovery.\n\n\n“Never take for granted that scientific achievement is celebrated—we took it for granted, and for far too long, and we are paying the price,” Arnold told the June 29 opening ceremony of the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting, an annual conference that brings together Nobel laureates and early-career researchers.\n\n\nScientists warn US will lose a generation of talent because of Trump cuts\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/03/national-science-foundation-trump-cuts\n\nThe scientists warn that Trump’s assault on diversity in science is already eroding the quality of fundamental research funded at the NSF, the premier federal investor in basic science and engineering, which threatens to derail advances in tackling existential threats to food, water and biodiversity in the US.\n\n\n“Before Trump, the review process was based on merit and impact. Now, it’s like rolling the dice because a Doge person has the final say,” said one current program officer. “There has never in the history of NSF been anything like this. It’s disgusting what we’re being instructed to do.”\n\n\nTrump’s big, beautiful bill calls for a 56% cut to the current $9bn NSF budget, as well as a 73% reduction in staff and fellowships – with graduate students among the hardest hit.\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve estimates that government-supported research from the NSF and other agencies has had a return on investment of 150% to 300% over the past 75 years, meaning US taxpayers have gotten back between $1.50 and $3 for every dollar invested.\n\n(There is a great graphic titled “Democratic states have had more NSF grants cancelled” and the numbers are 917M in blue states; 583 in red – which is a bit misleading, because TX is the 3rd hardest hit; GA in top part)\n(There is another great graphic on cuts by institution titled “Harvard NSF grants account for 10% of all cancellations, by budget”)\n\nThe sweeping cuts to the NSF come on top of Trump’s dismantling of other key scientific research departments within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Agriculture (USDA) and US Geological Service (USGS).\n\n\nTrump’s big, beautiful bill cuts the USGS budget by 39%. This includes slashing the entire budget for the agency’s ecosystems mission area (EMA), which leads federal research on species & ecosystems and houses the climate adaptation science centers.\n\n\nNIH cuts: Red states losing out as canceled grants are reinstated:\n\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2025/07/03/nih-cuts-grant-restoration-complicated-by-limits-to-court-order-trump-dei-restrictions/\n\nAfter the first grant termination rolled into Professor Cheri Levinson’s inbox, her university told her it wasn’t worth taking the time to appeal the decision; the odds of success were too low. Ultimately, she had three National Institutes of Health grants terminated that were meant to support trainees from diverse backgrounds in her lab studying eating disorders at the University of Louisville.\n\n\nBut her state’s Republican attorney general didn’t join AGs from other states, most of them blue states, who sued the Trump administration to block the grant cancellations. So two weeks ago, when many researchers exhaled in relief as a federal judge ruled that a wide swath of the terminations were illegal, and ordered them reinstated, Levinson wasn’t one of them.\n\n(In blue states 2.1B reinstated; in red states 62M)\n\n\n\n“Disaster Looms”: Justice Jackson’s Warning for the Country – Mother Jones\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/06/injunctions-supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson/\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a president who wanted to be king. His Congress was acquiescent. The high court approved. But lower federal courts held firm to the rule of law. Time and again, they blocked the president from seizing power and violating the nation’s laws. So the president turned to the justices on the Supreme Court for a favor: please stop these meddlesome little courts from getting in my way. And then one day in June, the Supreme Court granted his wish.\n\n\nThis is what happened on Friday in a case about birthright citizenship before the United States Supreme Court. The Trump administration’s blatantly unconstitutional executive order from January denying birthright citizenship to the children of certain classes of immigrants quickly ran up against lower court judges, who prohibited the Trump administration from violating one of the country’s most sacred Constitutional rights.\n\n\n“The Court’s decision is nothing less than an open invitation for the Government to bypass the Constitution,” Sotomayor warned. “The Executive Branch can now enforce policies that flout settled law and violate countless individuals’ constitutional rights, and the federal courts will be hamstrung to stop its actions fully.”\n\n\nJackson warns, this decision has altered our system of government and, sooner or later, may destroy it. “Disaster looms,” she warns. If a court cannot command the executive to follow the law, then there exists “a zone of lawlessness within which the Executive has the prerogative to take or leave the law as it wishes, and where individuals who would otherwise be entitled to the law’s protection become subject to the Executive’s whims instead.”\n\n\n“In this country, the Executive does not stand above or outside of the law,” Jackson writes. But her dissent is also a warning that this is becoming less true. A year ago, the Republican appointees exempted the president from the dictates of criminal law. Now, it suggests that even if a court finds the administration’s actions illegal or unconstitutional, it can continue to enforce them against those who haven’t challenged the action in court, either individually or as part of a class action. As a result, the president rises beyond the bounds of the law, and individuals slip from the embrace of its protection.\n\n\n“I have no doubt that, if judges must allow the Executive to act unlawfully in some circumstances, as the Court concludes today, executive lawlessness will flourish, and from there, it is not difficult to predict how this all ends,” Jackson wrote. “Eventually, executive power will become completely uncontainable, and our beloved constitutional Republic will be no more.”\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: A.I.

    "text": "A different take on academic freedom.\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/07/02/university-autonomy-stems-corporate-rights-opinion\n(Thanks BE for sharing)\n\nRather than an individual right, academic freedom is, properly understood, what Stanley Fish called “a guild concept.” More specifically, it is a concept belonging to the incorporated guild of professors and students (and others). This theory bases academic freedom not on freedom of speech—a troublesome basis for academic freedom—but on the university’s corporate rights. These corporate rights, not infrequently finding expression in constitutions, are also sometimes constitutional rights. By substituting corporate rights for freedom of speech, we turn a foundation of sand into stone.\n\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that, in spring 2025, we may have entered the nadir of American academic freedom. Austin Sarat rightfully urged us, even before then, to find new ways to guard academic freedom “against external threats.” Now, in the face of ongoing hostility from both state and federal governments, it is imperative that universities deploy the full range of arguments at their disposal, including those based on their forgotten corporate rights. In other words, it’s time for universities to invoke their corporate rights. Allow me to explain.\n\n\n“Incorporation,” David Ciepley has written, “is a powerful tool.” Corporations can sue and be sued in their own names, hold property, enter contracts, use their own seals and legislate. Importantly, the university’s corporateness bears no necessary relationship to its current autocratic constitution, whereby, according to Timothy V. Kaufman-Osborn, universities are “ruled by external lay governing boards vested with the panoply of powers customarily granted to corporations, including the power to adopt, amend, and revoke its basic rules of institutional governance.” Thus, we can use the university’s corporateness to rebuff external attacks, while also working, as Arjun Appadurai wrote recently, “to break the unilateral power of boards of trustees.”\n\n\n\n\necretly Recorded by Anti-DEI Group, ‘No Longer Employed’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/2025/06/30/secretly-recorded-anti-dei-group-now-no-longer-employed\n\nhe YouTube video is titled “CAUGHT ON TAPE: UNC Administrator Admits They Ignore DEI Ban.” Heart-pumping music plays. A hidden camera records a Black woman—labeled in the video as Janique Sanders, a University of North Carolina at Charlotte employee—speaking to people out of frame.\n\n\nThe woman apparently didn’t know she was speaking to someone doing their own covert work: the conservative group Accuracy in Media, or AIM [which opposes the scientific consensus on climate change], conducting a sting. Now Sanders, who was assistant director of the Office of Leadership and Community Engagement, is no longer employed by UNC Charlotte.\n\n\nWhere Anti-DEI Legislation Has Been Proposed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/here-are-the-states-where-lawmakers-are-seeking-to-ban-colleges-dei-efforts\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nNYTimes: Trump Withholds Nearly $7 Billion for Schools, With Little Explanation\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/us/trump-education-funds.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(K-12, but still just reneging)\n\nThe Trump administration has declined to release nearly $7 billion in federal funding that helps pay for after-school and summer programs, support for students learning English, teacher training and other services.\n\n\nThe money was expected to be released by Tuesday. But in an email on Monday, the Education Department notified state education agencies that the money would not be available.\n\n\nMany school districts also rely on federal dollars to help non-English-speaking students and families, including training teachers and hiring translators.\n\n\nA Decades-Old Government Program That Supports Hispanic Students Is Under Fresh Scrutiny\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-decades-old-government-program-for-supporting-hispanic-students-is-under-fresh-scrutiny\n\nFor 30 years, colleges enrolling a certain share of Hispanic students have been able to secure a title that opens up millions in federal funding. Hundreds of them now qualify as Hispanic-serving institutions, or HSIs.\n\n\nBut those programs are now in the line of fire.\n\n\nThe U.S. Education Department doled out about $350 million to Hispanic-serving institutions in the 2024 fiscal year across three competitive grant programs; the National Science Foundation awarded another $53.5 million. Colleges can become eligible when at least 25 percent of their undergraduate students identify as Hispanic or Latino/a.\n\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions, the group responsible for the lawsuit that ended race-conscious admissions policies at selective colleges in 2023, has brought a new complaint in Tennessee arguing that federal funding designated solely for HSIs is discriminatory.",

For most of the program’s existence, federal agencies including the Defense Department posted their funding opportunities directly to the site, where thousands of outside organizations could see and apply for them — until April, when DOGE staffers changed the website’s permissions to give themselves power to review and approve all grants across the government.\n\n\nBut on Thursday, federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, according to emails obtained by The Post and the two people, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive situation. The decision follows fears that months of DOGE-linked delays would lead to what critics allege would be the illegal impoundment of federal funds.\n\n\nPSC, higher-ed unions slam federal research funding cuts\n\nhttps://thechiefleader.com/stories/psc-higher-ed-unions-slam-federal-research-funding-cuts,54668\n\nResearchers at the city and state’s public universities affected by cuts to federal grant funding urged the state’s congressional leaders to oppose further cuts to funding proposed in President Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”\n\n\nMembers of the Professional Staff Congress, the New York State United Teachers and other higher-education advocates rallied against the existing and proposed funding reductions outside of the Trump Building at 40 Wall St. Monday.\n\n\nAt the City University of New York, 70 grants worth $17 million in funding have been slashed, which has put 100 jobs at risk, according to the PSC. And at SUNY, there have been $50 million in grant terminations.\n\n\nThe PSC’s president, James Davis, called the cuts to SUNY and CUNY “an outrage,” adding that cuts to research could delay life-saving medical treatments.\n\n\nKathleen Cumiskey, a psychology professor at the College of Staten Island who has worked at CUNY for 22 years, said that a $700,000 National Science Foundation grant for a three-year STEM education program aimed at improving academic outcomes at Hispanic-serving institutions was terminated on May 2, just 20 months into the program’s lifespan.\n\n\n“We believe the decision to terminate our grant was unfair. Unfortunately, under the current administration, it appears that the agency has been redirected in ways that threaten our nation’s scientific discovery and the importance of broad participation in the creation of new knowledge,” Cumiskey said.\n\n\nCity Comptroller Brad Lander joined the researchers, noting that higher education contributes $35 billion to the city’s economy and employs about 140,000 people.\n\n\n\n\nStalled funding, canceled grants: How the NIH crisis is affecting Duke - The Chronicle\n\nhttps://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2025/06/duke-university-national-institutes-of-health-cut-cancel-duke-research-nih-federal-funding-grants-trump-administrations\n\nDuke receives around $1.2 billion in research grants a year, and much of it comes from the NIH. In fiscal year 2024 NIH support totaled $580 million.\n\n\n“Most of the time, that’s a point of pride, a marker of success, but it’s also a point of challenge when that fundamental model is changing. This is what we’re dealing with now,” said Mary Klotman, executive vice president for health affairs and dean of the School of Medicine\n\n\nGrant Watch contains a field for “tagged_words” — which matches words from a list that The New York Times reported could trigger an automatic review of grants — to words used in a grant’s title or abstract. Noam Ross, a computational researcher part of Grant Watch, told The Chronicle that Grant Watch doesn’t know exactly how grants are flagged for termination, but “suspect that these words are part of a search process for selecting them based on [The New York Times article] and other reporting.”\n\n\nThe 15 canceled NIH grants contained flagged words like “expression,” “disability,” “trans” and “systemic.” However, these words were not used in contexts to promote DEI initiatives, although some may have had diversity supplements including the two described below.\n\n\nThe grant that had the word “disability” in its abstract focused on identifying biomechanical and biological factors that lead to early onset osteoarthritis following a partial meniscectomy — a surgical procedure commonly done to remove damaged meniscal tissue following a tear. The grant had over $750,000 remaining in funding at the time of termination.\n\n\nFurthermore, a grant that had both “trans” and “systemic” in its abstract was working toward editing neural circuits by engineering channel proteins to control the point of contact between two neurons. It had around $1.4 million remaining in funding at the time of termination.\n\n\nIn most other cases where “trans” was flagged, the term generally referred to other words with the trans- prefix, such as disease transmission, transgenic genetic material, translational studies or signal transduction.\n\n\nMost notably, the NIH ended Duke’s Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development, which was a $129 million program and a leader in its field. The program was in its sixth year of funding out of seven and was largely expected to be renewed for an additional cycle. Associated funding has not been listed as terminated in federal databases and thus was not included in the Grant Watch data analysis.\n\n\nThe Scientific Research Lost Amid the Trump Administration’s NIH Cuts — ProPublica\n\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/nih-cuts-research-lost-trump/\n\n\n\n\nE.P.A.

The Senate legislation underwent significant changes in the week leading up to its passage, several of which softened provisions in the House bill that had raised alarms across the sector. The Senate retained the House’s broad plan to raise the endowment tax, for example, but it limited the extent of the hike and opened up loopholes for small institutions.\n\n\nSenators abandoned a House plan to eliminate subsidized federal undergraduate loans. Also out: a House provision that would have required students to take 30 credit hours per academic year to receive the maximum Pell Grant award, and 15 credit hours to be eligible for Pell Grants at all. Community colleges were particularly panicked about the provision.\n\n\nThe Senate kiboshed a controversial risk-sharing plan introduced in the House bill, which would have forced colleges to kick money into a new pot of federal aid when their students defaulted on federal-loan repayment. Instead, it offered an alternative approach with roots in the gainful-employment rule, a cornerstone of the Obama administration’s accountability efforts.\n\n\nThe Senate-passed plan would yank federal-loan eligibility from programs that fail to deliver an earnings bump to their graduates. Senators tweaked the details in the days leading up to Tuesday’s vote so colleges would be judged on the earnings of their graduates, not dropouts.",

    "text": "Why UVA President’s Resignation Could Be a ‘Watershed Moment’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/executive-leadership/2025/06/30/uva-reels-after-president-resigns-under-pressure\n\n“I think this is a watershed moment,” said Jon Holbein, an associate professor of public policy, politics and education at UVA. “If a moderate president at a conservative–for–higher education institution who has followed the law when it comes to diversity [can be pushed out], no president is immune from the Trump administration’s ire.”\n\n\nUVA faculty, some board members, students and community say Ryan’s departure is a blow to the institution. “His loss makes us worse,” said Michael Kennedy, a UVA professor and faculty representative on the Board of Visitors, describing Ryan as a “shattering success.”\n\n\nThe Jefferson Council, a conservative alumni group that publicly called for Ryan’s resignation, called the DEI efforts exclusive, discriminatory and “the new McCarthyism.”\n\n(I think that used to be called doublespeak; this organization seems to have been founded by someone who in March had this news: Youngkin fires Bert Ellis from University of Virginia Board of Visitors))\n\nThe U. of Virginia’s President Was Targeted Over DEI. Now He’s Resigning.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/university-of-virginia-president-reportedly-resigns-under-pressure-from-trump-administration\n\nPeter McDonough, vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education, called the government’s handling of the matter “a potentially ominous effort to control a learning environment it finds objectionable.”\n\n\n“This is unprecedented,” McDonough said in an interview. “Maybe we should have seen it coming.”\n\n\nDhillon said that the department had told UVa representatives that the government “lacked confidence” in Ryan, given his “participation in groups” that had publicly opposed the Trump administration’s policies. (Ryan, along with hundreds of other college presidents, signed a letter condemning “unprecedented government overreach” in higher education.)\n\n\nNYTimes: What the University of Virginia Should Have Done\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/30/opinion/university-of-virginia-doj-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUnder investigation by the Justice Department, the university had a strong defense, if only it had the courage to assert it. Instead of fighting back against what I believe to be false accusations that the university was violating federal law, and the even more outrageous demand that Mr. Ryan resign as a remedy for those alleged violations, the university’s Board of Visitors pushed out a popular president. Instead of presenting facts and law, the board waved the white flag of surrender. Mr. Ryan’s resignation is a victory for intimidation and fear over the rule of law.\n\n\nI served as university counsel at the University of Virginia from 2018 through 2022. During that time, it was my job to defend the university from unfounded allegations and investigations. The Justice Department has alleged that the university’s actions violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which states, “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” Had I been university counsel last week, I would have advised my client to challenge what I believe to be a false allegation that the university’s policies are unlawful.\n\n\nTitle VI prohibits racial classifications, quotas or programs that are exclusive to any one race, gender or protected class. It does not prevent federal contractors, such as universities, from pursuing the goal of creating a diverse community, one that ensures all individuals can participate in the learning environment regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, national origin or political ideology. Eligibility for programs and opportunities based on those and other immutable characteristics is illegal. Programs that create a pipeline of diverse applicants are not.\n\n\nWhile the university’s compliance with Title VI is clear to me, it was challenged by the Justice Department. Informed by the advocacy of the America First Legal Foundation, an organization founded by the current White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, the department alleged that the university’s compliance efforts were insufficient, a mere relabeling of D.E.I. programs that broke the law. The department’s proposed remedy was the resignation of the university’s leader — a shocking move that reveals the personal animus behind the investigation. The administration would rather oust a leader than force compliance with a particular policy.\n\n\nWhy? By law, the university and all state agencies are represented by the attorney general of Virginia. The current attorney general has been an outspoken opponent of D.E.I. programs. He joined Virginia’s governor, Glenn Youngkin, in applauding the university’s dismantling of D.E.I. programs in March 2025. This means rather than having an advocate loyal to the university and its interests, Mr. Ryan and the university were saddled with counsel aligned with the other side.\n\n\nThe university’s governing board took a similar position. The majority of the current board was appointed by Mr. Youngkin, who has said, “D.E.I. is done at the University of Virginia.” In failing to assert these valid legal defenses, the board abdicated its responsibility to protect the university and defend it against unfounded allegations.\n\n\nMr. Ryan was known to urge the university to be both “great and good” in all its endeavors. His departure will result in a less inclusive university community, which will harm all students who choose the University of Virginia. It is a sad day for the university, which will suffer the consequences of this bad decision.\n\n\nNew York City Tech/CUNY one of the highlighted BA degree granting institutions whose faculty are increasingly integrated—race/ethnicity non-white.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-is-the-share-of-minority-instructors-at-colleges-with-the-most-full-time-faculty-members\n(VAC says: This interesting graph explains too the attacks from this fed administration on higher ed)\n\n\n\nWhat a Harvard Deal Would Mean for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-a-harvard-deal-would-mean-for-higher-ed\n\nIn the absence of more information, some faculty members within Harvard are fearful that the government isn’t negotiating in good faith, and that any agreement would only open the door to an unlawful power grab — although not everyone is so pessimistic. Outside of Harvard, expert observers of higher education also range between faith in what Harvard could accomplish in a settlement, and worry that any such deal may set a dangerous precedent for the rest of the sector.\n\n\nRyan D. Enos, a professor of government, can’t envision any positive outcomes from settling with the Trump administration. “It’s shortsighted to think that anything good can come from trying to negotiate your way out of extortion with an authoritarian regime,” he says.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration “Finds” Harvard Violated Civil Rights Law\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/30/us/politics/trump-harvard-civil-rights-law.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Okay, quotes in the headline were added as this was never established beyond the walls of the white house)\n\nIn a letter to Harvard’s president, Alan M. Garber, on Monday, officials from four federal agencies said that the university was “in violent violation of Title VI,” a portion of federal civil rights law that bars discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin. In recent years, government officials have interpreted the provision to include “shared ancestry and ethnic characteristics” as within the law’s protections.\n\n\nIn their letter, the Trump administration officials said that Harvard’s “commitment to racial hierarchies” had “enabled antisemitism to fester” at the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university. They warned that not making “adequate changes immediately will result in the loss of all federal financial resources and continue to affect Harvard’s relationship with the federal government.”\n\n\nHarvard sharply disputed the government’s account, saying in a statement on Monday that antisemitism was “a serious problem” that the school had taken significant steps to address. The university added that it was “far from indifferent on this issue” and that it “strongly disagrees with the government’s findings.”\n\n\nBut Paula M. Stannard, the director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a separate letter on Monday that Harvard’s varied steps to combat antisemitism, such as the development of a faculty panel to investigate and discipline people in connection with certain accusations of misconduct, were “too little, too late.”\n\n\nAccording to Ms. Stannard, “Jewish and Israeli students at Harvard University were subject to severe, pervasive and objectively offensive harassment from Oct. 7, 2023, through the present.”\n\n(Add Paula M Stannard to your bingo card)\n\nThe Trump administration found Harvard violated the civil rights of Jewish and Israeli students, putting the university’s federal funding further at risk\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-violated-students-civil-rights-trump-administration-finds-4a0ed7aa?st=UNno8L&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nA formal “notice of violation” of civil-rights law generally is a step that can come before either a lawsuit from the Justice Department or a voluntary resolution with the school. Under past presidential administrations, civil-rights investigations at universities usually ended with voluntary resolution agreements.\n\n\nWhat a Harvard Deal Would Mean for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-a-harvard-deal-would-mean-for-higher-ed\n(Thanks VAC for sending along; this )\n\nIf Harvard reverses course, it would compromise that sense of common cause. “There will be a certain feeling of betrayal if they make a deal,” according to Levitsky [professor of Latin American studies].\n\n\nRyan D. Enos, a professor of government, can’t envision any positive outcomes from settling with the Trump administration. “It’s shortsighted to think that anything good can come from trying to negotiate your way out of extortion with an authoritarian regime,” he says.\n\n\nHarvard is the wealthiest U.S. university. Can it survive a Trump standoff?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/01/harvard-trump-federal-funding/\n\n“With its resources and an AAA bond rating, Harvard has financial freedom and flexibility. Still, these headwinds, and there are a lot of them, are piling up all at once,” said Howard Bunsis, an accounting professor at Eastern Michigan University.\n\n\nSince the federal government began demanding the university change how it operates in April, Harvard has lost more than $2 billion in federal funding.\n\n\nBut the university has limited access to its endowment and already depends on it for a significant portion of its operating budget. And about 80 percent of Harvard’s endowment, a collection of 14,000 funds, is restricted to uses that donors stipulate, and the university cannot change the terms of those gifts — some dating back to the founding of the school — on its own.\n\n\nHarvard has about $8.2 billion in unfunded private equity commitments coming due in the near term, said Michael Markov, co-founder and chairman of the research firm Markov Processes International. Finding the money to cover those kinds of commitments could put tremendous pressure on universities with large private equity stakes, he said.\n\n\n“It’s just this perfect storm of academic freedom in the crosshairs at the same time that the universities are vulnerable because of the financial uncertainties associated with their endowments and their private equity investments,” he [Philip Casey, founder and chief executive of Institutional LPs] said.\n\n\nHarvard would face a budget shortfall of about a billion dollars a year if President Trump follows through on all of his plans and threats spanning research funding, tax policy and student enrollment\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-trump-funding-budget-cuts-1dc5bf2f?st=H5Jdr2&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(Has an excellent graphic “Harvard’s 2024 revenue and worst-case scenario losses” showing losses: -240M for endowment (of 2.4B), -700M federally funded research (max amount), -110M grad school (of 800M) )\n\nHarvard University would face a budget shortfall of about a billion dollars a year if President Trump follows through on all of his plans and threats spanning research funding, tax policy and student enrollment, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\nThat grim math helps explain why Harvard has taken steps toward negotiating with the administration after months of defiance. The Journal’s estimate, based on publicly available data, is for a worst-case scenario in which Harvard loses all federal research funding, federal student aid and its ability to enroll international students, and Congress hikes its annual endowment tax to 8%.\n\n\n\n\n\nMiddle States Gives Columbia a Warning\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/02/columbia-u-gets-warning-accreditor\n\nThe Middle States Commission on Higher Education warned Columbia University that its accreditation could be in jeopardy.\n\n\nThe warning, sent June 26, comes after the Education Department pressured the accreditor in early June to take action against Columbia. The Trump administration has said that Columbia violated federal civil rights laws and is thus out of compliance with the accreditor’s standards. But only accreditors can say whether a college is in compliance. Middle States had already opened a review of Columbia before the department’s notice, conducting an on-site evaluation in April.\n\n\nMiddle States said in the warning that it doesn’t have sufficient evidence showing Columbia is complying with its standard on ethics and integrity. The criteria for that standard includes “a climate that fosters respect among students, faculty, staff, and administration from a range of diverse backgrounds, ideas, and perspectives” and “compliance with all applicable government laws and regulations.” The accreditor requested a monitoring report, due by Nov. 3, that demonstrates the university’s compliance with the standard, and will consider Columbia’s accreditation status at a March 2026 meeting. Columbia remains accredited in the meantime.\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Cyberattack Appears Politically Motivated, University Says\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/nyregion/columbia-university-hacker.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(trigger alert; graphic image accompanies article)\n\nThe cyberattack that caused a widespread shutdown of Columbia University’s computer systems last week appears to be the work of a “hacktivist” — a hacker who also stole student data with the apparent goal of furthering a political agenda, a Columbia official said on Tuesday.\n\n\nA cyber-forensics firm hired by the university reported that the hack appeared to be highly sophisticated and targeted in its theft of documents, the official said. The official added that Columbia had not yet determined the scope of the data theft and that it could take weeks to months to do so. Columbia’s websites and internal systems, however, which went down during the attack, were up and running again within a week.\n\n\nThe person who communicated with Bloomberg News provided it with 1.6 gigabytes of data representing 2.5 million student applications to Columbia dating back decades. The data included students’ and applicants’ university-issued identification numbers, their citizenship status, the decisions made on their applications and the academic programs to which they applied, among other information.\n\n\nBloomberg reported that it was able to confirm the accuracy of the data for eight Columbia students and alumni who applied to the university between 2019 and 2024.\n\n\nColumbia was attacked about a week after its chief information officer, Gaspare LoDuca, announced that he was leaving the university and joining M.I.T. as its vice president for information systems and technology. Over his 10-year tenure at Columbia, Mr. LoDuca oversaw all information technology systems, including cybersecurity, The Columbia Spectator reported.\n\n\nColumbia University plans to steal a page from the conservative playbook\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/07/02/states-climate-law-model-legislation/\n\n“States are the front line for climate action in this moment of the second Trump administration. And one of the key needs that state legislators have is legal support for writing better laws,” said Vanessa Fajans-Turner, executive director of Environmental Advocates New York, which is also funding the initiative. “We see climate legislation ending up very consistently in the courts, being challenged. And if that is going to be the case, we need to start writing legislation with the strongest possible legal basis.”\n\n\nThe acting president of Columbia University apologized Wednesday for messages in which she appeared to diminish concerns about antisemitism on campus and criticize a Jewish member of the school’s board of trustees\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-president-claire-shipman-apology-3cd70dc5?st=W8PktJ&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nStefanik tweeted out a one-word message above a picture of Claire Shipman, the school’s acting president: “Resign.”\n\n\nIn one string of messages Shipman criticized Shoshana Shendelman, an outspoken Jewish trustee, and said she should not be on the board. In a 2023 exchange, the vice chair of the board asked Shipman: “Do you believe that [Shendelman] is a mole?” Shipman said she believed she was and added that she was “so, so tired” of her.\n\n\n\n\nIndiana Public Universities to ‘Voluntarily’ End 19% of Degrees\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/curriculum/2025/07/02/ind-public-universities-voluntarily-ending-19-degrees\n(Their quotes, not mine. Thanks VAC for sharing.)\n\nIndiana’s public higher education institutions plan to eliminate or consolidate over 400 programs, equaling roughly one-fifth of their degree offerings statewide, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education said Monday. The announcement came just before a new state law took effect Tuesday setting minimum requirements for how many graduates individual programs must produce at the universities and Ivy Tech Community College, or face termination.\n\n\nRepublican state legislators passed the law—a state budget bill with major higher education provisions tacked on—less than two days after revealing it in April. It says institutions can ask the commission for approval to keep offering degrees that don’t meet the threshold of average annual graduates. But the universities “voluntarily submitted” the first wave of hundreds of programs to be ended or consolidated, the commission said, meaning they didn’t ask for exemptions.\n\n\nAccording to a list posted by the commission, among the 400 degrees to be nixed or combined into others are many foreign language and teacher-education programs. The list also includes undergraduate and graduate degrees in fine arts, English, business, economics, philosophy, history, anthropology, sociology, journalism, public administration, social work, labor studies, political science, American studies, Africana studies, women’s and gender studies, religious studies, and classical studies.\n\n\nSTEM and medical disciplines aren’t being spared, either; the eliminated or consolidated degrees include some in health, biology, chemistry, math, computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. Indiana University at Bloomington, for instance, is ending its Ph.D. in astrophysics. More than half the programs to be eliminated or merged are in the IU system. Vincennes University is the only public institution in the state that didn’t “voluntarily” submit programs to be cut or combined.\n\n\nIndiana’s program slashing can be seen as another consequence of the broader push by red states’ legislatures to intervene in higher education by restricting teaching, attacking tenure and, now, dictating curricula.\n\n\nHeather Akou, the president-elect of the IU Bloomington Faculty Council, said the council didn’t get to vote on these “draconian” cuts and mergers at the flagship campus. “Not only did we not vote, we were not even consulted with,” Akou said.\n\n\nBalthaser, the IU South Bend AAUP member, said, “This was done very intentionally to essentially change the mission of the university—to shrink it, to essentially destroy what we understand as the public [land-grant] university.”\n\n\n\n\n\nUPenn Agrees to Ban Transgender Athletes in Women’s Sports, Correct Records | National Review\n\nhttps://www.nationalreview.com/news/upenn-agrees-to-ban-transgender-athletes-in-womens-sports-correct-records/\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/01/penn-agrees-trumps-demands-will-strip-trans-athletes?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed&utm_campaign=e64fe0d91e-DNU_2021_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1fcbc04421-e64fe0d91e-236791398&mc_cid=e64fe0d91e&mc_eid=7f06c26dc8#\n(From VAC)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/us/penn-title-ix-transgender-swimmer-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania said on Tuesday that it had struck a deal with the federal government that will limit how transgender people may participate in its athletic programs, bowing to the Trump administration’s new interpretation of the law that bans sex discrimination in education.\n\n\nThe agreement was tied to a civil rights investigation, conducted by the Department of Education, of a transgender woman’s participation on Penn’s women’s swim team three years ago. In April, the Education Department said that Penn’s support for the swimmer, Lia Thomas, had violated the law governing sex discrimination in most educational settings.\n\n\nPenn’s president, J. Larry Jameson, noted in a statement on Tuesday that the university had been in compliance with the interpretation of federal law that was in effect when Ms. Thomas swam there. But he said that the Trump administration’s inquiry had left Penn vulnerable to “significant and lasting implications,” a reference to the possibility of a loss of federal funding.\n\n\n\n\n\nUVirginia President resigns under pressure from Trump DOJ\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/27/us/politics/university-of-virginia-president-resigns-trump-justice-department.html\n(Thanks VAC, who is counting scalps)\n\nThe University of Virginia’s president, James E. Ryan, has told the board overseeing the school that he will resign in the face of demands by the Trump administration that he step aside to help resolve a Justice Department inquiry into the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, according to three people briefed on the matter.\n\n\nFor the leader of one of the nation’s most prominent public universities to take such an extraordinary step demonstrates President Trump’s success in harnessing the investigative powers of the federal government to accomplish his administration’s policy goals.\n\n(Harnessing = weaponizing by another name to this group: Gregory Brown, Harmeet Dhillon, Stephen Miller)\n\nThe University of Virginia has been considered among the top five public universities for more than two decades, according to U.S. News & World Report rankings, and has maintained that position during Mr. Ryan’s tenure. This year, the Princeton Review ranked the university as the second-best value among all public colleges. Last year, Time magazine ranked the college as the fourth-best public school at producing future leaders.\n\n(WSJ reporting)\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/uva-president-resigns-james-ryan-dei-trump-d02a60fe?st=Ce97ks&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(The letter Ryan sent to the University)\n\nTo the University community:\n\n\nI am writing, with a very heavy heart, to let you know that I have submitted my resignation as President of the University of Virginia. To make a long story short, I am inclined to fight for what I believe in, and I believe deeply in this University. But I cannot make a unilateral decision to fight the federal government in order to save my own job.\n\n\nTo do so would not only be quixotic but appear selfish and self-centered to the hundreds of employees who would lose their jobs, the researchers who would lose their funding, and the hundreds of students who could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld.\n\n\nThis is especially true because I had decided that next year would be my last, for reasons entirely separate from this episode-including the fact that we concluded our capital campaign and have implemented nearly all of the major initiatives in our strategic plan.\n\n\nWhile there are very important principles at play here, I would at a very practical level be fighting to keep my job for one more year while knowingly and willingly sacrificing others in this community. If this were not so distinctly tied to me personally, I may have pursued a different path. But I could not in good conscience cause real and direct harm to my colleagues and our students in order to preserve my own position.\n\n\nIt has been an honor to be your President. Thanks for the outpouring of support over the last few days and weeks.\n\n\nMy deepest gratitude to all of the faculty, staff, students, and alumni, who make this University and this community both great and good. This was an excruciatingly difficult decision, and I am heartbroken to be leaving this way.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nJim Ryan, President\n\n(The pressure was on in at least three areas: research funding, student financial aid, or student visas).\n\nThe Unexpected Trump Target\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-unexpected-trump-target\n\nRyan’s ouster has turned UVa into an unexpected battlefield in the Trump administration’s political assault on colleges. For months, officials have wielded federal power to rebalance what they see as higher ed’s extreme leftward tilt and stamp out diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.\n\n\nHarmeet K. Dhillon, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, sees things differently. Ryan “has built his entire career on what was the academic vogue, which is DEI. Now, it isn’t,” she told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “And so I think it is time for new leadership that’s willing to comply with federal law.”\n\n\nOther faculty members see Ryan’s decision as a submission to political actors who have no inclination or tendency to compromise. The professors wish that Ryan, or the university, had fought back. Deborah McDowell, a professor of English, thinks Ryan should have forced the board to fire him.\n\n\n“Capitulation is sometimes in order,” she said. “For this, I don’t think it was. This is spoken as someone who does not agree and would not represent myself as one in full agreement with the decisions Ryan has made throughout his presidency. I am not. But bullies cannot be placated. They are greedy.”\n\n\nThe targeting of UVa may seem somewhat arbitrary, the result of a random commonality in the curricula vitae of two of the nation’s top civil-rights officials. In May, The Chronicle reported a story teasing out the connections between Dhillon; her deputy, Gregory Brown, who attended UVa as an undergraduate and has sued the institution in the past over a civil-rights issue; the Jefferson Council, the conservative alumni group that has been calling on Ryan to resign for months; and the Board of Visitors.\n\n\nLetters from DOJ reveal threats to U.Va. over admissions policies, Ryan’s leadership - The Cavalier Daily - University of Virginia’s Student Newspaper\n\nhttps://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2025/07/letters-from-doj-reveal-threats-to-uva-over-admissions-policies-ryans-leadership\n\nBetween April 11 and June 17, the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division sent seven letters to University officials, according to documents obtained by The Cavalier Daily through a Freedom of information Act request.\n\n\nIn these letters, the Justice Department sought confirmation that the University had removed affirmative action from its admissions policies and had ended Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives. Some letters also alleged that the University had failed to protect students against antisemitism. The letters did not confirm whether or not the Justice Department’s demands had been met.\n\n\nApril 11: The first letter was sent by the Justice Department to the University April 11 and requested information regarding the University’s admissions policies. The Justice Department said it aimed to ensure the University was no longer using affirmative action, in accordance with the Supreme Court’s decision in Students for Fair Admissions vs. Harvard in 2023.\n\n\nThe letter requested, among other documents, all admissions data broken down by race and ethnicity for the past five academic years, including applicant test scores, GPA, extracurricular activities, essays and admissions outcomes. It also requested that the University verify that race was not used as a factor in determining any scholarship or financial aid awards to students.\n\n\nJune 17: The final letter turned up in the FOIA request was from June 17. “Time is running short, and the Department’s patience is wearing thin,” the letter read.",

(In total, 6 percent of students at U.S. institutions come from other countries.)\n\n\n“The reduction in international students presents a credit risk for universities heavily reliant on this demographic because of potential declines in tuition income, as international students typically pay full tuition fees,” the report states. “Additionally, with declining numbers of high school students over the next several years in the U.S. leading to fewer domestic students, universities intending to fill the gap with more international students may fall short.”\n\n\nNobelist: U.S. Scientists Took Support ‘For Granted’ Before Trump Cuts\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/07/03/nobelist-scientists-took-support-granted-trump\n\nFrances Arnold, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018 for her work on engineering enzymes, told an audience of young scientists in Germany that the “utter chaos” in U.S. politics of recent months, which has seen billions of dollars removed from scientific research, might be viewed in terms of a wider failure to communicate the value of scientific discovery.\n\n\n“Never take for granted that scientific achievement is celebrated—we took it for granted, and for far too long, and we are paying the price,” Arnold told the June 29 opening ceremony of the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting, an annual conference that brings together Nobel laureates and early-career researchers.\n\n\nScientists warn US will lose a generation of talent because of Trump cuts\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/03/national-science-foundation-trump-cuts\n\nThe scientists warn that Trump’s assault on diversity in science is already eroding the quality of fundamental research funded at the NSF, the premier federal investor in basic science and engineering, which threatens to derail advances in tackling existential threats to food, water and biodiversity in the US.\n\n\n“Before Trump, the review process was based on merit and impact. Now, it’s like rolling the dice because a Doge person has the final say,” said one current program officer. “There has never in the history of NSF been anything like this. It’s disgusting what we’re being instructed to do.”\n\n\nTrump’s big, beautiful bill calls for a 56% cut to the current $9bn NSF budget, as well as a 73% reduction in staff and fellowships – with graduate students among the hardest hit.\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve estimates that government-supported research from the NSF and other agencies has had a return on investment of 150% to 300% over the past 75 years, meaning US taxpayers have gotten back between $1.50 and $3 for every dollar invested.\n\n(There is a great graphic titled “Democratic states have had more NSF grants cancelled” and the numbers are 917M in blue states; 583 in red – which is a bit misleading, because TX is the 3rd hardest hit; GA in top part)\n(There is another great graphic on cuts by institution titled “Harvard NSF grants account for 10% of all cancellations, by budget”)\n\nThe sweeping cuts to the NSF come on top of Trump’s dismantling of other key scientific research departments within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Agriculture (USDA) and US Geological Service (USGS).\n\n\nTrump’s big, beautiful bill cuts the USGS budget by 39%. This includes slashing the entire budget for the agency’s ecosystems mission area (EMA), which leads federal research on species & ecosystems and houses the climate adaptation science centers.\n\n\nNIH cuts: Red states losing out as canceled grants are reinstated:\n\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2025/07/03/nih-cuts-grant-restoration-complicated-by-limits-to-court-order-trump-dei-restrictions/\n\nAfter the first grant termination rolled into Professor Cheri Levinson’s inbox, her university told her it wasn’t worth taking the time to appeal the decision; the odds of success were too low. Ultimately, she had three National Institutes of Health grants terminated that were meant to support trainees from diverse backgrounds in her lab studying eating disorders at the University of Louisville.\n\n\nBut her state’s Republican attorney general didn’t join AGs from other states, most of them blue states, who sued the Trump administration to block the grant cancellations. So two weeks ago, when many researchers exhaled in relief as a federal judge ruled that a wide swath of the terminations were illegal, and ordered them reinstated, Levinson wasn’t one of them.\n\n(In blue states 2.1B reinstated; in red states 62M)",

    "text": "“Disaster Looms”: Justice Jackson’s Warning for the Country – Mother Jones\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/06/injunctions-supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson/\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a president who wanted to be king. His Congress was acquiescent. The high court approved. But lower federal courts held firm to the rule of law. Time and again, they blocked the president from seizing power and violating the nation’s laws. So the president turned to the justices on the Supreme Court for a favor: please stop these meddlesome little courts from getting in my way. And then one day in June, the Supreme Court granted his wish.\n\n\nThis is what happened on Friday in a case about birthright citizenship before the United States Supreme Court. The Trump administration’s blatantly unconstitutional executive order from January denying birthright citizenship to the children of certain classes of immigrants quickly ran up against lower court judges, who prohibited the Trump administration from violating one of the country’s most sacred Constitutional rights.\n\n\n“The Court’s decision is nothing less than an open invitation for the Government to bypass the Constitution,” Sotomayor warned. “The Executive Branch can now enforce policies that flout settled law and violate countless individuals’ constitutional rights, and the federal courts will be hamstrung to stop its actions fully.”\n\n\nJackson warns, this decision has altered our system of government and, sooner or later, may destroy it. “Disaster looms,” she warns. If a court cannot command the executive to follow the law, then there exists “a zone of lawlessness within which the Executive has the prerogative to take or leave the law as it wishes, and where individuals who would otherwise be entitled to the law’s protection become subject to the Executive’s whims instead.”\n\n\n“In this country, the Executive does not stand above or outside of the law,” Jackson writes. But her dissent is also a warning that this is becoming less true. A year ago, the Republican appointees exempted the president from the dictates of criminal law. Now, it suggests that even if a court finds the administration’s actions illegal or unconstitutional, it can continue to enforce them against those who haven’t challenged the action in court, either individually or as part of a class action. As a result, the president rises beyond the bounds of the law, and individuals slip from the embrace of its protection.\n\n\n“I have no doubt that, if judges must allow the Executive to act unlawfully in some circumstances, as the Court concludes today, executive lawlessness will flourish, and from there, it is not difficult to predict how this all ends,” Jackson wrote. “Eventually, executive power will become completely uncontainable, and our beloved constitutional Republic will be no more.”",

    "text": "Dear All,\nPlease find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.\nThanks to K, KB, MB, and VAC for sending along great items for this digest.\n\n\n\n“Antisemitism in Higher Education: Examining the Role of Faculty, Funding, and Ideology” testimony is rescheduled\n\nhttps://edworkforce.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=412535\n\nFull Committee Hearing; July 15, 2025 - 10:15 AM\n\n\nUC Berkeley chancellor is prepping for Capitol Hill grilling\n\nhttps://www.berkeleyside.org/2025/07/07/uc-berkeley-chancellor-is-prepping-for-capitol-hill-grilling?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=1804604d16-EMAIL_\n(Thanks K for sharing this lengthy and interesting article about the background for the postponed testimony of the UC Chancellor, the CUNY Chancellor, and campus leader of Georgetown in front of a House subcommittee)\n\nEver since President Trump announced in January a crackdown on antisemitism in higher education that included threats to deport pro-Palestinian student protesters, his administration has used that framework to rescind billions of dollars in research money from U.S. universities he claims are not protecting their Jewish students. Trump has demanded that at some universities, the federal government should be allowed to influence student admissions, faculty hiring, and the content of some academic departments. The federal government has already canceled $2.6 billion in research grants to Harvard, $400 million to Columbia University, and millions more to five other universities.\n\n\nIn a talk at the Berkeley City Club last Wednesday, Lyons addressed the assault on higher education, its impacts on Cal, the balance between free speech and the right for all students to feel safe on campus, and how the UC system is approaching this era, all while it is wondering and waiting if UC will get one of those dreaded “Columbia-Harvard letters” from the administration announcing draconian cuts.\n\n\nMore cuts may be coming. Leo Terrell, senior counsel at the Department of Justice and head of its antisemitism task force, said in a Fox TV interview in May that there will be “massive lawsuits against [the] UC system. … Expect hate crime charges filed by the federal government. Expect Title VII lawsuits.”\n\n\n“Has Berkeley turned a blind eye to antisemitism?” Lyons asked in a hypothetical question to the Berkeley City Club audience. “Have we been deliberately indifferent about antisemitism on campus? No way.”\n\n\nBut executive orders aren’t law, said Catherine Lhamon, former assistant secretary for civil rights in the U.S. Department of Education, at a journalism conference in May. “Executive orders bind federal agencies about what the president directs those federal agencies to do. They don’t create law.” When asked about Trump’s antisemitism executive order, she added that schools and colleges “have an opportunity to challenge that in court, and they are not bound by the administration’s interpretation.” Llamon was recently named executive director of the Edley Center on Law & Democracy at UC Berkeley Law.\n\n\nHe [David Cole, a professor at Georgetown Law] told the committee that antisemitism only violates Title VI in narrow circumstances: When the speech is targeting an individual’s Jewish identity and when the speech is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies equal access to an education.\n\n\n“That’s a very high standard,” Cole said in the hearing. “It’s almost never been met in the case law.”\n\n\n“To be honest, and with all due respect, the hearings this committee held on this same subject last year are reminiscent not of a fair trial of any sort, but of the kind of hearings the House Committee on Un-American Activities used to hold,” Cole said in his testimony. “And I think we can all agree that the HUAC hearings were both a big mistake and a major intrusion on the First Amendment rights of Americans.”\n\n\nThe House committee wants to know if the widespread protests against Israel’s war in Gaza were authentic or were orchestrated by outside forces.\n\n\n\n\n\nPSC Resolution Condemns Retaliatory Firing of CUNY Faculty\n\nhttps://psc-cuny.org/news-events/week/psc-condemns-retaliatory-firing-of-cuny-faculty-retro-for-part-timers/\n(The UFS XC and chairs of the AF committee also sent a letter to the Brooklyn College President).\n(The PSC Academic Freedom Committee has sent two letters)\n\nCUNY suspends student activist leader, fires four faculty members in escalation of repression against Palestine activism\n\nhttps://mondoweiss.net/2025/07/cuny-suspends-student-activist-leader-fires-four-faculty-members-in-escalation-of-repression-against-palestine-activism/\n(Mondoweiss may not be the most impartial source of reporting)\n\nstudent organizer Hadeeqa Arzoo Malik has been suspended for a year. While she is suspended from CCNY, she is not permitted to enroll in any other CUNY college.\n\n\nCUNY has also fired four faculty members, including Corinna Mullin. Mullin held teaching positions at CUNY as an adjunct professor at Brooklyn College and John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\n\nIn the middle of June, Malik was notified of her suspension in a letter signed by CCNY’s Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs, Dr. Ramón De Los Santos. During Malik’s speech at the press conference, which was chanted via “the people’s mic,” a familiar call-and-response tactic used by protest organizers, Malik shared CUNY’s justification for suspending her.\n\n\n“I was suspended… for allegedly violating the CUNY Henderson Rules number one and seven and CCNY demonstration policies one and two.\n\n\nMullin told Mondoweiss, “Over the past several years, there has been a pattern of external Zionist, far-right organizations like Camera, Betar, and Canary Mission targeting me and other CUNY workers and students for organizing in solidarity with Palestine.”\n\n(See: https://www.chronicle.com/article/an-anonymous-groups-list-of-purported-critics-of-israel-helped-steer-a-u-s-crackdown-on-student-activists )\n\nChancellor Matos Rodríguez was preparing to scapegoat Malik, Mullin, and the other adjunct professors whose teaching positions were terminated when presenting to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education & Workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 4th letter from SUNY\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1NgZBYtbE_1R0i2fyhZWPNkKtP-13qp69satQo_pcIVU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ntcq7lonrt\n(to sign: )\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1CQXwYQeXukzS-HJjCfXZXQOwV-Mgq3pPtAF88AQ8P2g/viewform?edit_requested=true\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that the cause of higher education is in great measure the cause of all humanity, that higher education’s function is to secure human equality, expand human rights, and free human potential; and that colleges and universities were instituted, and derive their just powers, from their commitments to the following foundational principles:\n\n\nthe pursuit of knowledge, truth, and wisdom for the public good; the cultivation of freedoms of thought, inquiry, speech, expression, assembly, and association for all students, staff, and faculty; the integrity of academic research, teaching, and learning; the provision of educational programs and services to all students in the safest and most supportive environment possible; the advancement of diversity, equity, and inclusion; the autonomy and democratic accountability of campus governance.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Statement from the Eula Mae and John Baugh Foundation on the Cancellation of LGBTQIA+ Research Grant by Baylor University\n\nhttps://www.baughfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/Baugh-Foundation-Statement.pdf\n\nThis decision disserves Baylor students, faculty, and the broader Christian community. Baylor has a duty to protect and uphold the integrity of scientific inquiry, allowing its world class faculty to investigate complex issues without fear of reprisal based on shifting political winds. Pulling the rug out from under its faculty after those researchers have already put the grueling work into securing funding, work they undertook with Baylor’s full knowledge and approval, is a chilling affront to the very concept of academic freedom. Stymying research and opportunity will inevitably lead the best and brightest students and faculty to other universities where their work and their freedom will be valued and protected.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo save themselves, universities must cultivate civic friendship\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/30/universities-trump-survival-free-speech/\n\nWe believe a fundamental reason for the decline of the pursuit of truth on campuses is the collapse in acknowledging the importance of civic friendship — which, following Aristotle, we understand to be the bond of mutual respect and willingness to cooperate for the sake of the common good, even across significant disagreements or divisions.\n\n\nThe cultivation and recovery of civic friendship must necessarily undergird any successful effort by universities to regain public legitimacy and the moral high ground. Here, we hope to provide some guidance for restoring campus cultures where faculty and students feel free to speak their minds and explore ideas, no matter how unpopular or controversial on or off campus they happen to be.\n\n\nThis is because universities that do not model and actively foster civic friendship become ideological seminaries, sending into the world graduates who have been trained to be zealots for particular causes rather than formed as dispassionate and determined truth-seekers.\n\n\nThey call for the principled defense of freedom of speech and the consistent enforcement of rules against speech-chilling behaviors such as harassment and the shouting-down of speakers, as well as any activities that disrupt core academic priorities such as teaching, studying and research. And they demand a commitment by university leaders to ensuring that seminar rooms and lecture halls are not “safe spaces” but rather Socratic Spaces, where students are made to wrestle with ideas that challenge their preconceived assumptions and deeply held beliefs — indeed, ideas which might make them feel uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\nNIH cancels sickle cell research grant, citing DEI, doctor says – NBC4 Washington\n\nhttps://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/nih-cuts-study-on-disease-that-affects-mostly-black-patients-citing-dei-doctor-says/3948371/\n\nA doctor says she’s scrambling to figure out how she’ll continue her work helping sickle cell disease patients after the National Institutes of Health cancelled her $750,000 research grant, citing diversity, equity and inclusion and divisiveness as a factor.\n\n\nSickle cell disease affects about 100,000 people in the U.S., and 90% of patients are Black, according to NIH.\n\n\nBut two weeks ago, the NIH told her it’s taking away her funding, citing a “low return on investment.” It also said studies involving DEI “support unlawful discrimination on the basis of race … which harms the health of Americans.”\n\n\nColleges, companies and philanthropic groups are retooling millions of dollars in scholarships that for years supported minority students\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/anti-dei-minority-scholarships-a721ba1b?st=h3S9TL&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nColleges, companies and philanthropic organizations are retooling millions of dollars in scholarships that for years supported minority students.\n\n\nUnder threat from the Trump administration and activist groups over diversity programs, some are scrapping scholarships entirely. Others are broadening the programs to focus on low-income students in general or tweaking applications to try to keep their original missions.\n\n\n“We’re seeing widespread fear of litigation prompt many scholarship providers to re-evaluate,” said Jackie Bright, president of the National Scholarship Providers Association.\n\n\nEducation experts said the changes could make it harder for minority students to graduate from college. “There’s going to be a decline in college affordability and completion rates for those students,” Bright said.\n\n\nEdward Blum [for your bingo card], whose group was behind the lawsuit that led to the 2023 Supreme Court decision that banned affirmative action, also brought the McDonald’s lawsuit.\n\n\nNYTimes: How Trump’s D.E.I. Cuts Are Hurting Rural, White Americans Too\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/us/trump-science-nih-grants-dei-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s push to end D.E.I. has been a blunt instrument, eliminating highly competitive grant programs that defined diversity well beyond race and gender. Those who have lost grants include not only Black and Latino scientists, but also many like Mr. Dillard, who are white and from rural areas, which are solidly Trump country. The administration has decried universities as hotbeds of liberal elitism, inhospitable to viewpoint diversity. The canceled diversity grant programs were intended to make science less elite, by developing a pipeline from poorer areas of the country that tend to be more conservative.\n\n\n“I think it’s very different in their minds, who is getting the D.E.I. stuff,” Mr. Dillard said. “People on the right, they don’t realize they’re limiting the opportunity of their own kids by supporting this.”\n\n\nMany young scientists talk about feeling betrayed by the places that raised them. “I’ve encountered a lot of callousness about my fellowship being terminated,” said Ms. Reneker, at Princeton. People back home tell her “there’s going to be some casualties along the way,” or “there must be some kind of misunderstanding.”\n\n\n“These are the kids we are supposed to be propping up,” the teacher, Greg Tucker, said. “It comes back to the whole Make America Great thing again. How did we make America great? It was through science.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump ends interest subsidy for Biden’s student loan repayment plan\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/09/trump-ends-interest-subsidy-bidens-student-loan-repayment-plan/\n\nThe Education Department on Wednesday said it will resume collecting interest on the student loans held by 7.7 million people enrolled in a Biden-era repayment plan that is tied up in the courts.\n\n\nAn analysis by the advocacy group Student Borrower Protection Center estimates that an average borrower affected by the policy change could incur more than $3,500 in interest charges in a year or roughly $300 per month.\n\n\nThe department’s announcement arrives days after President Donald Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill, which, among other things, gets rid of the Save plan for new borrowers and gives current borrowers until July 2028 to exit the program. Advocacy groups see the department’s decision to end the interest subsidy as a way to hasten that departure and say the move will harm millions of borrowers.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Lost Generation of Researchers\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-lost-generation-of-researchers\n\nWith that, Buan became one of thousands of early-career scholars who have become collateral damage amid policy changes at the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and other government agencies. As these agencies have sought to put caps on indirect funding, several doctoral programs paused or reduced admissions in February and March. Another wave of uncertainty hit weeks later, as the NIH and NSF terminated hundreds of existing grants, throwing many current doctoral and postdoctoral scholars’ funding into question. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year contains deep cuts to the NIH, NSF, and other federal agencies that support scientific research.\n\n\nAll told, the White House’s actions, many of which are tied up in court, could result in a lost generation of budding academics. Students are being forced to delay their graduate studies, continue them abroad, or forgo them entirely. The collective impact of those individual decisions is nearly impossible to measure, says Joanne Padrón Carney, chief governmental relations officer for the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\nhe NSF, for instance, awarded only 1,000 of its Graduate Research Fellowships this year, half of its usual total and the lowest number of awards in 15 years, according to Nature; the NIH canceled a slate of early-career programs.

The bill also sends about $10 million more to the National Weather Service and boosts funding for National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n(That is good news?)\n\nAlthough the science funding received bipartisan support, a fight over funding for the new Federal Bureau of Investigations headquarters could tank the legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: How to Wreck the Nation’s Health, by the Numbers\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/30/opinion/hhs-cuts-harming-american-health.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has terminated thousands of grants, including funding for pandemic prevention, and research grants related to cancer, vaccines and chronic diseases. The loss of research funding will delay medical discoveries. Though the agency publishes a weekly list of terminated grants, the full scope of funding cancellations has been obscured, especially at the National Institutes of Health, the major funder of medical research. A database created by Harvard researchers, Grant Watch, has helped to fill in the gaps.\n\n(See the great infographics)\n\nSince President Trump has taken office, H.H.S. has cut over $9.5 billion in grant funding that had been approved but not yet distributed to programs and researchers.

This article uses the Health Systems Performance Assessment Framework to identify key policies regarding resources, financing, governance, and service delivery and their impact on the cost, quality, access, and equity of the US health system. The evaluation is largely negative. The administration, in its very energetic first hundred days, has already undermined resources, financing, and in particular governance in areas as diverse as oversight of long-term care, scientific research, and vaccination policy. Administration rhetoric and budget proposals called for severe reductions in health care access and actions to terminate services for particular groups, such as immigrants or gender minorities. Many of the particular actions, such as mass layoffs of specialist scientific and regulatory staff, will be difficult to reverse.\n\n(On a grid with 64 options, 54 were colored harmful; none beneficial)\n\nShocks to specialist research communities cause rapid attrition, with scientists exiting the workforce and even the country after as little as a month of disrupted funding, and resources diverted from high-quality basic research to privately assigned, less-impactful work.17,18 They may also increase hesitancy around research participation, particularly for groups that are already under-represented in health research. One estimate suggests that the administration’s proposed NIH cuts, over 25 years, will save $500bn and cost the country $8.2 trillion in lost health-a cost more than 16 times greater than the savings, even excluding lost economic benefits from health research.\n\n\nAcross Table 1, the second Trump administration’s record is one of unprecedented damage. Budget proposals that were not enacted but started in the first hundred days would exacerbate the damage through enormous cuts to Medicaid, supplemental nutrition, HHS and NIH. Decentralizing responsibilities to the states will produce less efficiency (due to loss of economies of scale and specialist resources such as laboratories), more variation in state politics, resources, and risks, and more inequality between states.108 Trump is the least popular president in US polling history.109 It remains to be seen whether the majority of Americans will stand up and successfully demand that he change course to reflect their views.\n\n\nNIH Plans to Cap Publisher Fees, Dilute ‘Scientific Elite’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/07/10/nih-plans-cap-publisher-fees-dilute-scientific\n\nThe National Institutes of Health announced a plan Tuesday to implement a cap on the fees publishers can charge NIH-funded researchers to make their work publicly accessible.\n\n\nBoth the updated open-access policy and the NIH’s newly announced publisher fee cap, which takes effect next year, are designed to put some limits on the $19 billion for-profit scholarly publishing industry, which is dominated by a small group of for-profit megapublishers, including Elsevier, Taylor & Francis and Springer Nature. The industry thrives on the unpaid work of scholars—including thousands funded by the NIH and other federal agencies—who rely on publishing their research in prestigious journals to earn tenure, promotion and recognition as leaders in their fields.\n\n\n“I expect the response to this will be that these journals will lose some of their market power,” Bhattacharya told Charlie Kirk, founder of the right-wing group Turning Point USA, in an interview Tuesday. “A lot of their market power has to do with the fact that they bully scientists into paying large fees and essentially end up bullying us.”\n\n\nDuring the pandemic, Bhattacharya, who was a health economist at Stanford University before Trump appointed him director of the NIH, became one of the political right’s favorite examples of how the so-called scientific elite allegedly suppressed nonconformist scientific beliefs. In 2020, he criticized public officials’ recommendations for people to stay home to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus, sparking widespread backlash from other experts—including the officials running the NIH at the time.\n\n\nBut now that he’s in charge of the same agency that dismissed his views as “fringe” nearly five years ago, Bhattacharya has vowed to “establish a culture of respect for free speech in science and scientific dissent at the NIH.”\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation Department Postpones NACIQI Summer Meeting\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/08/education-department-postpones-naciqi-summer-meeting\n\nThe delay means that by the time the panel meets, the terms of six of its 18 members will have expired. The education secretary, House and Senate each appoint six members. In May, Education Secretary Linda McMahon requested nominations to fill six seats in October. Experts and members of the committee are worried that the Trump administration is trying to stack the panel in its favor as decisions about the future of higher education accreditation loom.\n\n\nThe panel, known as the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, advises the department on which independent agencies should have the power to accredit colleges and therefore which colleges should have access to federal aid. At the next meeting, NACIQI is scheduled to decide whether to renew recognition for the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the accreditor for Columbia University.\n\n\nPanel member and chair Zakiya Smith Ellis told the Journal that she is concerned that the Trump administration is “trying to take over this advisory group that is supposed to be in place for our expertise in higher education, not to push a certain political agenda.”\n\n\nFlorida Board of Governors to Vote on New Accreditor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/regional-public-universities/2025/07/11/fla-board-governors-vote-creating-new\n\nThe goal is to accredit six institutions by next summer and secure Department of Education recognition by June 2028, according to the business plan. (A new accreditor typically has two years to prove it is operating in accordance with federal regulations to receive federal approval.)\n\n\nThe Commission for Public Higher Education would be incorporated as a nonprofit organization in Florida, initially funded by a $4 million appropriation from the Florida State Legislature, according to the business plan. Other involved higher ed systems are expected to cough up similar funds. A board of directors representing each of the founding systems would oversee the new accreditor.\n\n\n“CHEA does not believe that states are likely to be effective accreditors,” she wrote. “Historically, states have not had the staff, experience, or knowledge necessary to create a higher education accreditor. It is critically important that higher education reflects an impartial and unbiased accrediting review process that is focused on student learning outcomes. To date, there has not been a state that has accomplished this.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourt Filing Sheds Light on Civil Rights Complaints Under Trump\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/08/trump-admin-dismisses-34k-civil-rights-complaints-3\n\nThe Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights dismissed more than 3,400 complaints from March 11 to June 27—a figure that advocates say is unprecedented and concerning.\n\n\nSince March 11, OCR received 4,833 complaints and opened 309 investigations, according to the filing from Rachel Oglesby, the department’s chief of staff. OCR also started 26 of what the office calls “directed investigations,” which aren’t based on a specific complaint. Another 3,424 complaints were dismissed “consistent with OCR’s Case Processing Manual,”\n\n\n“The dismissals are high and the case-resolution numbers are low, and I understand the resolutions they count reflect work completed before the [reduction in force],” she said, adding that the 290 resolutions “reflect a shocking diminution of work output from the office.”\n\n\nOglesby didn’t provide any more information about why the complaints were dismissed or what types of violations they focused on. The department usually releases more information about OCR’s complaints and investigations as part of an annual report and in the budget process.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithheld Adult Education Funds Worry Community Colleges\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/community-colleges/2025/07/10/withheld-adult-education-funds-worry-community\n\nThe roughly $716 million was supposed to be disbursed to states July 1 and then divvied up among their adult education providers, such as community colleges. But the funding for high school equivalency classes, English as a second language programs and other adult education services never arrived.\n\n\n“Initial findings show that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,” wrote the OMB spokesperson, citing examples of states and schools using the money to support students in the country without proper documentation\n\n\n“If funding is not provided, there are nothing but bad options for institutions,” said David Baime, senior vice president for government relations for the American Association of Community Colleges. He predicts community colleges would have to reduce adult education services, lay off personnel and vie for funds to fill in the gap from states and other sources. But even so, “the funding is so substantial in a number of places that there’s no immediate source of replacing that money.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: What the Republicans’ New Policy Bill Means for Higher Education\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/03/us/trump-bill-education-college-student-loans.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe bill would expand the tax on endowments that universities use for financial aid, roll back student loan protections and cap the amount students can borrow for graduate programs.\n\n\nThe bill would “make college less affordable,” said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, adding that schools could become less economically and racially diverse.\n\n\nIt comes as the Trump administration has unleashed an attack on colleges and universities, cutting research grants and making it harder for international students to enroll. The administration has singled out top schools like Harvard, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania. But the bill shows that the Republican agenda for higher education extends far beyond the Ivy League.\n\n\nThe sweeping cuts to Medicaid at the center of the bill could also have ramifications for higher education. Experts say the changes, which include new work requirements, will make juggling work, education and family responsibilities even harder for low-income students.\n\n\nGetting student loans will be more difficult.\n\n\nStudent loans may depend on alumni salaries.\n\n\nUniversity endowments face higher taxes.\n\n\nPell Grants can now be used for nondegree programs. – The bipartisan move was welcomed by community colleges, which said it would make work-force training more accessible to nontraditional students.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsm.

Per the legislation, full-time UW system instructors must teach at least 24 credits across the fall and spring terms, starting September 1, 2026. That requirement is halved for the state’s two R1 universities, UW-Madison and UW-Milwaukee.\n\n\nIn addition to the 24 minimum credits during the fall and spring, instructors who are on a 12-month contract must teach six credits in the summer. Workloads for part-time instructors will be set in proportion to full-time requirements.\n\n\nBut Michael DeCesare, a senior program officer at the national American Association of University Professors, said state-mandated minimum course loads are at odds with AAUP standards, which recommend that faculty “participate fully in the determination of workload policy.”\n\n\nBudget director says NY health care will be ‘destabilized’ by federal cuts\n\nhttps://www.timesunion.com/capitol/article/dob-director-ny-health-care-destabilized-no-20765002.php\n(Thanks MB for sharing)\n\nNew York’s top budget official warned of a “destabilized” state health care system after an omnibus bill signed last week by President Donald J. Trump takes effect, but said state leaders are not currently poised to raise taxes as they face the possibility of drastic cuts within the year.\n\n\nDivision of Budget Director Blake Washington, one of the top officials in Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration, said New York lawmakers will confront “hard decisions” soon after the federal bill’s sweeping changes to safety net programs including Medicaid.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Trump Uses the DOJ as Tool of ‘Fear-Mongering’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/07/trump-deploys-justice-dept-ramp-attacks-higher-ed\n\nWhile traditional DOJ cases can take years to resolve, Bondi’s agency has launched and concluded investigations in a matter of months or even weeks, leaving little room for appeal, negotiation or settlement. That makes it difficult to overlook the possibility that Trump’s efforts to enforce the law on college campuses are part of his calculated clench for control, higher education advocates say.\n\n\n“The DOJ has been involved in higher education before. Up until now, though, I just don’t have a sense that it’s ever been intentionally weaponized for political purposes,” said Peter McDonough, vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education. “We certainly can feel the intensity of focus and the desire for political messaging. There’s a fear factor that clearly has been a motivator and an objective.”\n\n\n“What we’re seeing here is less about enforcement of laws and more about government terrorism,” said Ferise of the Indiana law firm. “By definition terrorism is using intimidation to unlawfully pursue some kind of political gain or vendetta, and I can’t see how this is anything other than that.”\n\n\nHow a Shadowy Online Blacklist Became a Legal Threat to Pro-Palestinian Activists – Mother Jones\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/07/canary-mission-israel-palestine-blacklist-university-trump-deportation-ozturk-khalil/\n\nThe goal, Canary Mission says, is to “ensure that today’s radicals are not tomorrow’s employees” and “combat the rise in anti-Semitism on college campuses.” But lawyers, activists, and critics of the site worry that the consequences could now be more serious than diminished job prospects and that foreign students like Öztürk—who have been rounded up by the Trump administration—may have been targeted for imprisonment and deportation because they were listed on an anonymous blacklisting site. (Öztürk has since been returned to Massachusetts.)\n\n(Several CUNY community members are listed on canary)\n\nWhat’s clear, however, is that Canary Mission has been repeatedly cited in federal lawsuits against student activists and in official US government communications with universities, as the Trump administration detains students with little explanation. Canary Mission’s “about us” page claims its content meets “high standards of accuracy and authenticity,” but the spin it puts on pro-Palestinian activities is hardly objective—especially given the increasingly severe consequences for the people it describes. Attending an antiwar protest, for example, becomes “participation in a pro-Hamas rally;” criticism of Israeli policies is framed as “demonizing Israel.”\n\n\nIt “is not the first,” Lockman said, “but [it is] maybe the most effective.” Today, it holds profiles of more than 1,800 students, 1,100 professors, 300 medical professionals, and 2,100 people simply labeled “professionals.”\n\n\nIn 2018, an investigation by the Forward connected Canary Mission to a registered Israeli nonprofit called Megamot Shalom, or “Peace Trends.” Donations to Canary Mission, the outlet reported, were being routed through Megamot Shalom.\n\n\nThe Israeli nonprofit registry shows that Megamot Shalom, still active seven years after its launch, has only 11 employees. More than 99 percent of its budget—about a million dollars, for fiscal year 2023—comes via donations from abroad.\n\n\nThe Helen Diller Family Foundation listed a donation as “CANARY MISSION FOR MEGAMOT SHALOM” on its publicly accessible tax forms in 2016. (After journalists found the donations, the foundation stopped giving to either organization.) That same year, the Michael and Andrea Leven Family Foundation donated $50,000 to Megamot Shalom, and told a Jewish Currents reporter in 2021 that the money was intended for Canary Mission.\n\n\nMother Jones identified two American foundations that have donated to Canary Mission more recently: the Natan and Lidia Peisach Family Foundation, which donated $100,000 in fiscal year 2023, and the Ann and Robert Fromer Charitable Foundation, which donated $20,000 that same year.\n\n\nAs of 2016, Rabbi Ben Packer was listed as a board member of Megamot Shalom on Israel’s public charity registry. Born in the United States, Packer—who says he was a “rabbi on campus” at Duke University and the University of North Carolina—now runs an ultranationalist youth hostel in Jerusalem and lives in a West Bank settlement. He has boasted of his friendship with Stephen Miller, the Trump adviser behind many of the president’s most controversial immigration policies.\n\n\nAttempts to hold Canary Mission liable for defamation have mostly failed, in part because would-be plaintiffs cannot say conclusively whether or not it is housed in the United States. Kinza Khan, a Pakistani American Muslim woman from\n\n\nSome lawmakers, too, are treating Canary Mission as a legitimate source for triggering government investigations. Last year, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce sent letters to schools like MIT and UC Berkeley inquiring about those institutions’ responses to alleged antisemitism referenced in professors’ Canary Mission profiles.\n\n\nNow, as Republicans move to further restrict citizenship, Canary Mission is supporting a campaign by Rep. Andy Ogles to revoke New York mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani’s citizenship and deport him from this country.\n\n\nAmicus brief by AAUP, Rutgers, Middle East Studies Association\n\nhttps://www.presidentsalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PA-brief.pdf\n(Thanks KB)\n\nAmicus curiae the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration (the “Alliance”) submits this brief to advise the Court of the effects of the administration’s policy of targeting non-citizen students and faculty at institutions of higher education throughout the country based on their political views.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: How Harvard’s Ties to China Helped Make It a White House Target\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/us/harvard-china-white-house-funding.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut American foreign policy has turned sharply hawkish against China, and even though Harvard has steadily reduced its ties there, the Trump administration has made the relationship another line of attack in its broader effort to bring the university to heel. The administration has stripped away billions of dollars in federal research funding and is trying to revoke its right to host international students and also end its nonprofit tax status.\n\n\nAlan M. Garber, the university’s president, has described the administration’s overall assault on the school as a power grab “unmoored from the law, to control teaching and learning at Harvard and to dictate how it operates.”\n\n\nHarvard’s Fight Is a Defense of Democracy and Civic Virtue\n\nhttps://www.liberalcurrents.com/harvards-fight-is-a-defense-of-democracy-and-civic-virtue/\n\nTo some observers, Harvard’s stand might seem like it’s just Ivy League self‑regard, an affluent institution protecting its perks. That reading gets the stakes backward. What is under attack is the rule‑of‑law scaffolding that lets any voluntary association—PTA or synagogue, start‑up or labor union—pursue its mission without waiting for White House permission slips or fearing punitive retaliation. A university that surrenders control over whom it may admit, hire, or teach ceases to be a university; it becomes a subordinate creature of politicians and the ever-changing whims of election results.\n\n\nThe counterexample is on display in another venerable American institution of higher education, the University of Virginia, where president James Ryan proffered his resignation in the face of a targeted pressure campaign from the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, and UVA’s Board of Visitors accepted it. Under the thin pretense of enforcing civil rights laws, the federal government is now essentially dictating policies, curriculum, and personnel according to the political whims of the White House.\n\n\nIt’s not only an outrageous attack on academic freedom, it’s also an attack on the constitutional autonomy of state governments, at the public university Thomas Jefferson was once so proud of chartering he had it inscribed on his grave.\n\n\nYet history warns that trimming our sails in hopes of preserving research dollars often achieves neither independence nor solvency. Ask Central European University. When Hungary’s Viktor Orbán demanded curricular control in 2017, CEU hesitated, negotiated, and was ultimately driven from Budapest anyway. Appeasement bought time but not independence.\n\n\nThe rest of us have a part to play. Other universities can file amicus briefs. Foundations and philanthropists can step in to help keep research going while funding cutoffs are litigated. Alumni can send the signal that integrity in this moment is what keeps their checkbooks open. Ordinary citizens can refuse to sacrifice higher principles on the altar of partisan cultural grievances. Democracy’s immune system is made of these antibodies.\n\n\nTrump administration ups pressure on Harvard with threat to accreditation\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/a60c469b-6c0c-49af-9c9d-6908f4ab6561\nand\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-accreditation-subpoena-trump-00d68304\n\nThe departments of Education and Health and Human Services notified Harvard’s accreditor that a government investigation found the school violated civil-rights law for allegedly failing to protect Jewish students from antisemitic harassment.\n\n\nThe notification doesn’t remove Harvard’s accreditation—which would leave the school virtually unable to operate. Education Secretary Linda McMahon urged Harvard’s accreditor to work with the school to “keep the Department fully informed of its efforts to ensure that Harvard is in compliance with federal law and accreditor standards.”\n\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would subpoena Harvard to obtain records relevant to the enforcement of immigration laws in connection to the school’s international students.\n\nand\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/us/politics/trump-harvard-data-accreditation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe details of those offers were unclear, but Wednesday’s moves from the Trump administration suggested that the government has been dissatisfied with Harvard’s proposals.\n\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s allies view the accreditation system as a potentially powerful tool in the administration’s crusade to upend higher education. Mr. Trump has described accreditation as a “secret weapon.” In April, he signed an executive order directing federal agencies to “promptly” inform accreditors about any schools his administration determines are in violation of civil rights law.\n\n\nThe idea has circulated at the university for several years but gained steam after pro-Palestinian protests began disrupting campus in late 2023\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-conservative-scholarship-center-trump-attacks-a187242a?st=QeDVCt&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nHarvard leaders have discussed creating a program that people briefed on the talks described as a center for conservative scholarship, possibly modeled on Stanford’s Hoover Institution, as the school fights the Trump administration’s accusations that it is too liberal.\n\n\nA spokesman for Harvard said an initiative under discussion “will ensure exposure to the broadest ranges of perspectives on issues, and will not be partisan, but rather will model the use of evidence-based, rigorous logic and a willingness to engage with opposing views.” He added that the school has been accelerating efforts to set up the initiative, which would “promote and support viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\n\n\n*Columbia in Talks With Trump Administration Over Restoring Federal Funding\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-federal-funding-negotiations-deal-trump-consent-decree-88427d9a?st=J62ErS&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nRecent versions of a potential agreement between the school and the government haven’t included a consent decree, according to two of those people. A government task force had initially sought to put the university under a consent decree, which would have put a federal judge in charge of overseeing Columbia’s compliance.\n\n\nMore recent discussions, however, have involved the possibility of a monitor or outside observer who would have less power than a federal judge.\n\n\nColumbia previously agreed to an earlier set of demands from the Trump administration, including restricting masks, empowering campus police with new powers to arrest students, and appointing a senior vice provost with broad authority to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies. But those concessions only kicked off formal negotiations and didn’t restore Columbia’s federal funding.\n\n\n“Our red lines remain the same,” she said. “We must maintain our autonomy and independent governance. We decide who teaches at our institution, what they teach and which students we admit.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump wants more apprenticeships. Indiana is going all in.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/06/trump-apprenticeship-high-school-students-college-alternative/\n\nBut in the United States, the number of apprenticeships for high-schoolers is still tiny, just over one-tenth of a percent of students, according to an estimate by the think tank New America. By contrast, in Switzerland — which has been praised widely for its apprenticeship model, including by U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon — 70 percent of high-schoolers participate. Indiana is among several states, including Colorado, South Carolina and Washington, that have embraced the model and sent delegations to Switzerland to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump staffers who set out to reshape their alma maters\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/11/trump-administration-reshape-alma-mater-universities-harvard/\n\nLess than a decade ago, Gregory W. Brown helped fundraise for the University of Virginia by posing for pictures in his old dorm room.\n\n\nNow he is central to the Trump administration’s effort to crack down on his alma mater for promoting diversity, equity and inclusion programs, as one of two Justice Department leaders and U-Va. alumni to threaten sweeping funding cuts and compel the school’s president to resign.\n\n\nDriven by personal experience, the staffers are pushing to overhaul the progressive culture they feel has come to dominate elite colleges and universities.\n\n\nTogether, the staff under Trump, who prizes his degree from the University of Pennsylvania’s business school, and Vice President JD Vance, who graduated from Yale Law School, are looking to reshape academia — working to purge campuses of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and imbue the next generations of students with their worldview.\n\n\nJust last year, Wasserman was an editor on the Harvard Law Review, one of the nation’s premier legal journals, working out of an academic building in Cambridge where he was socially alienated from his more liberal classmates and frustrated with the focus on selecting diverse voices, four of his former classmates said in interviews. This year, as a policy adviser to the president, he helped launch an investigation into that publication, the New York Times first reported.\n\n\nHarmeet Dhillon, the civil rights division director at the Justice Department who also attended U-Va., shared that frustration.\n\n\nTeaching literature is an exercise in freedom.

There may be some of that, I’ll concede, but not nearly as much as they imagine. I think that conservative students who bottle themselves up in class are more afraid of their peers’ reactions than their professors. How long before the Board of Visitors, guided by the Jefferson Council, decides it must take an active hand and begin vetting our syllabi?\n\n\nHannah Arendt, the political philosopher, suggests that a politically unanimous condition is always something to fear. When you have a sphere without tensions, without civil conflict, tyranny is in the wings. I fear that we at UVA may be on the verge of such a condition. The road that runs from the White House, to the Justice Department, to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office, to our Board of Visitors looks to be all too smooth. Who is going to stop the call for political conformity as it gathers force?\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration increases scrutiny of another Virginia university\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/10/george-mason-university-dei-probe-trump-administration/\n\nOn Thursday, the Education Department said it had opened its second civil rights investigation in two weeks into George Mason University, this one over the alleged use of race in the hiring and promotion of faculty members. The department said it had received complaints from multiple professors, including about university initiatives to make the demographics of faculty better reflect the diversity of its student body.\n\n\n“This kind of pernicious and wide-spread discrimination — packaged as ‘anti-racism’ — was allowed to flourish under the Biden Administration, but it will not be tolerated by this one,” Craig Trainor, the department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a news release.\n\n\nThis month, the Education Department notified George Mason that it had launched an investigation into the university’s alleged failure to address a hostile environment for Jewish students and faculty.\n\n\nThe stacking of investigations against George Mason follows a similar pattern that occurred in the Trump administration’s inquiries into U-Va.\n\n\nTed Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, said the probes into George Mason show the Trump administration is not interested only in “celebrity universities” like Harvard, and that institutions of higher education nationally will be watching.\n\n\nLast week, as the Education Department’s initial inquiry into George Mason became public, Washington came under fire from various conservative commentators.\n\n\nAn article in City Journal, a publication linked to the conservative think tank Manhattan Institute [Chris Rufo’s fingerprints are here], called Washington a “disastrous president” whose record “warrants his resignation or dismissal.”\n\n(also)\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/george-mason-university-antisemitism-investigation-trump\n(also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/11/george-mason-faces-2-title-vi-investigations?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed\n(also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/an-inside-job\n\n\n\n\n\nThey Want to Leave the U.S. Is a Master’s Their Ticket Out?\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/study-abroad/2025/07/07/prospective-emigrants-look-higher-education-leave-us\n\nHe doesn’t speak German. He doesn’t have ancestry in Austria. And he doesn’t need a master’s—he already has one in a different field. But as one of a growing number of Americans looking to leave the U.S. due to their disagreement with President Trump’s policies, studying abroad seemed like the path of least resistance for emigrating.\n\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, about one in five Americans said they would be interested in moving abroad if their preferred candidate did not win. Following Trump’s victory, the number of Americans searching for study abroad opportunities on the site Studyportals multiplied fivefold. CNBC reported that Google searches for “how to move to Canada” surged, especially in blue states such as Maine, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.\n\n\nWhat Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful’ Bill Means for NYC | THE CITY — NYC News\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/07/07/trump-budget-medicaid-food-stamps-local-impact/\n\nThe law punches a multi-billion dollar hole in the current state budget by reducing federal Medicaid funding, a blow that will almost certainly require Gov. Kathy Hochul to call a special legislative session in the coming months.\n\n\nThe hole gets much bigger in next year’s budget, which needs to be adopted by March 31, as the governor and legislators prepare for their reelection campaigns.\n\n\nThe immediate impact on the city will be less severe, but Mayor Eric Adams and the City Council will eventually be confronted with choices on whether to fill in some of the safety net gaps created by the GOP bill — or reduce aid to poor New Yorkers.\n\n\nUnder the Republican law, New York will lose $7.5 billion used to cover legal immigrants in the Essential Plan, which is almost entirely paid for by the federal government. The state will then have to transfer many of those people to Medicaid, which will cost an additional $2.7 billion, since federal aid for Medicaid only covers about 56% of the actual costs.\n\n\nSince the state’s fiscal year goes to the end of March, the cost in the current budget will be about $2.5 billion. But for the 2027 fiscal year, the cost will be slightly more than $10 billion.\n\n\nNew York will also immediately need to build a system to verify twice a year that Medicaid and SNAP recipients remain eligible by meeting new work requirements. The Hochul Administration estimates the cost at $500 million a year.\n\n\nThe stakes are high. A survey Public Health Solutions conducted of New Yorkers with a household income of less than $60,000 found that 71% would be unable to keep insurance, and 64% said they would be unable to maintain their doctor visits.\n\n\nNYTimes: Why 1.5 Million New Yorkers Could Lose Health Insurance Under Trump Bill\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/nyregion/trump-domestic-policy-bill-new-york-health-care.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn one key respect, the law’s impact will be felt more keenly in New York than in any other state — and it has nothing to do with Medicaid.\n\n\nInstead, it is the result of an obscure federal funding mechanism that sends billions of dollars a year to New York and nothing to most states. That money, which started flowing as a result of the Affordable Care Act, will be reduced drastically under the new law, beginning next year.\n\n\nOverall, the state could absorb a $10 billion hit annually because of the policy law. That reflects a combination of increased state expenditures and cuts in federal subsidies that support health insurance and health care for people with lower incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk’s Grok Is Calling for a New Holocaust\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/07/grok-anti-semitic-tweets/683463/\n\nThe year is 2025, and an AI model belonging to the richest man in the world has turned into a neo-Nazi.\n\n(’nuff said)\n\nCEO of Elon Musk’s X, Linda Yaccarino, resigns\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/07/09/elon-musk-linda-yaccarino-grok-x/\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

Trump has demanded that at some universities, the federal government should be allowed to influence student admissions, faculty hiring, and the content of some academic departments. The federal government has already canceled $2.6 billion in research grants to Harvard, $400 million to Columbia University, and millions more to five other universities.\n\n\nIn a talk at the Berkeley City Club last Wednesday, Lyons addressed the assault on higher education, its impacts on Cal, the balance between free speech and the right for all students to feel safe on campus, and how the UC system is approaching this era, all while it is wondering and waiting if UC will get one of those dreaded “Columbia-Harvard letters” from the administration announcing draconian cuts.\n\n\nMore cuts may be coming. Leo Terrell, senior counsel at the Department of Justice and head of its antisemitism task force, said in a Fox TV interview in May that there will be “massive lawsuits against [the] UC system. … Expect hate crime charges filed by the federal government. Expect Title VII lawsuits.”\n\n\n“Has Berkeley turned a blind eye to antisemitism?” Lyons asked in a hypothetical question to the Berkeley City Club audience. “Have we been deliberately indifferent about antisemitism on campus? No way.”\n\n\nBut executive orders aren’t law, said Catherine Lhamon, former assistant secretary for civil rights in the U.S. Department of Education, at a journalism conference in May. “Executive orders bind federal agencies about what the president directs those federal agencies to do. They don’t create law.” When asked about Trump’s antisemitism executive order, she added that schools and colleges “have an opportunity to challenge that in court, and they are not bound by the administration’s interpretation.” Llamon was recently named executive director of the Edley Center on Law & Democracy at UC Berkeley Law.\n\n\nHe [David Cole, a professor at Georgetown Law] told the committee that antisemitism only violates Title VI in narrow circumstances: When the speech is targeting an individual’s Jewish identity and when the speech is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies equal access to an education.\n\n\n“That’s a very high standard,” Cole said in the hearing. “It’s almost never been met in the case law.”\n\n\n“To be honest, and with all due respect, the hearings this committee held on this same subject last year are reminiscent not of a fair trial of any sort, but of the kind of hearings the House Committee on Un-American Activities used to hold,” Cole said in his testimony. “And I think we can all agree that the HUAC hearings were both a big mistake and a major intrusion on the First Amendment rights of Americans.”\n\n\nThe House committee wants to know if the widespread protests against Israel’s war in Gaza were authentic or were orchestrated by outside forces.",

Baylor has a duty to protect and uphold the integrity of scientific inquiry, allowing its world class faculty to investigate complex issues without fear of reprisal based on shifting political winds. Pulling the rug out from under its faculty after those researchers have already put the grueling work into securing funding, work they undertook with Baylor’s full knowledge and approval, is a chilling affront to the very concept of academic freedom. Stymying research and opportunity will inevitably lead the best and brightest students and faculty to other universities where their work and their freedom will be valued and protected.",

    "text": "To save themselves, universities must cultivate civic friendship\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/30/universities-trump-survival-free-speech/\n\nWe believe a fundamental reason for the decline of the pursuit of truth on campuses is the collapse in acknowledging the importance of civic friendship — which, following Aristotle, we understand to be the bond of mutual respect and willingness to cooperate for the sake of the common good, even across significant disagreements or divisions.\n\n\nThe cultivation and recovery of civic friendship must necessarily undergird any successful effort by universities to regain public legitimacy and the moral high ground. Here, we hope to provide some guidance for restoring campus cultures where faculty and students feel free to speak their minds and explore ideas, no matter how unpopular or controversial on or off campus they happen to be.\n\n\nThis is because universities that do not model and actively foster civic friendship become ideological seminaries, sending into the world graduates who have been trained to be zealots for particular causes rather than formed as dispassionate and determined truth-seekers.\n\n\nThey call for the principled defense of freedom of speech and the consistent enforcement of rules against speech-chilling behaviors such as harassment and the shouting-down of speakers, as well as any activities that disrupt core academic priorities such as teaching, studying and research. And they demand a commitment by university leaders to ensuring that seminar rooms and lecture halls are not “safe spaces” but rather Socratic Spaces, where students are made to wrestle with ideas that challenge their preconceived assumptions and deeply held beliefs — indeed, ideas which might make them feel uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\nNIH cancels sickle cell research grant, citing DEI, doctor says – NBC4 Washington\n\nhttps://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/nih-cuts-study-on-disease-that-affects-mostly-black-patients-citing-dei-doctor-says/3948371/\n\nA doctor says she’s scrambling to figure out how she’ll continue her work helping sickle cell disease patients after the National Institutes of Health cancelled her $750,000 research grant, citing diversity, equity and inclusion and divisiveness as a factor.\n\n\nSickle cell disease affects about 100,000 people in the U.S., and 90% of patients are Black, according to NIH.\n\n\nBut two weeks ago, the NIH told her it’s taking away her funding, citing a “low return on investment.” It also said studies involving DEI “support unlawful discrimination on the basis of race … which harms the health of Americans.”\n\n\nColleges, companies and philanthropic groups are retooling millions of dollars in scholarships that for years supported minority students\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/anti-dei-minority-scholarships-a721ba1b?st=h3S9TL&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nColleges, companies and philanthropic organizations are retooling millions of dollars in scholarships that for years supported minority students.\n\n\nUnder threat from the Trump administration and activist groups over diversity programs, some are scrapping scholarships entirely. Others are broadening the programs to focus on low-income students in general or tweaking applications to try to keep their original missions.\n\n\n“We’re seeing widespread fear of litigation prompt many scholarship providers to re-evaluate,” said Jackie Bright, president of the National Scholarship Providers Association.\n\n\nEducation experts said the changes could make it harder for minority students to graduate from college. “There’s going to be a decline in college affordability and completion rates for those students,” Bright said.\n\n\nEdward Blum [for your bingo card], whose group was behind the lawsuit that led to the 2023 Supreme Court decision that banned affirmative action, also brought the McDonald’s lawsuit.\n\n\nNYTimes: How Trump’s D.E.I.

Those who have lost grants include not only Black and Latino scientists, but also many like Mr. Dillard, who are white and from rural areas, which are solidly Trump country. The administration has decried universities as hotbeds of liberal elitism, inhospitable to viewpoint diversity. The canceled diversity grant programs were intended to make science less elite, by developing a pipeline from poorer areas of the country that tend to be more conservative.\n\n\n“I think it’s very different in their minds, who is getting the D.E.I. stuff,” Mr. Dillard said. “People on the right, they don’t realize they’re limiting the opportunity of their own kids by supporting this.”\n\n\nMany young scientists talk about feeling betrayed by the places that raised them. “I’ve encountered a lot of callousness about my fellowship being terminated,” said Ms. Reneker, at Princeton. People back home tell her “there’s going to be some casualties along the way,” or “there must be some kind of misunderstanding.”\n\n\n“These are the kids we are supposed to be propping up,” the teacher, Greg Tucker, said. “It comes back to the whole Make America Great thing again.

    "text": "A Lost Generation of Researchers\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-lost-generation-of-researchers\n\nWith that, Buan became one of thousands of early-career scholars who have become collateral damage amid policy changes at the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and other government agencies. As these agencies have sought to put caps on indirect funding, several doctoral programs paused or reduced admissions in February and March. Another wave of uncertainty hit weeks later, as the NIH and NSF terminated hundreds of existing grants, throwing many current doctoral and postdoctoral scholars’ funding into question. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year contains deep cuts to the NIH, NSF, and other federal agencies that support scientific research.\n\n\nAll told, the White House’s actions, many of which are tied up in court, could result in a lost generation of budding academics. Students are being forced to delay their graduate studies, continue them abroad, or forgo them entirely. The collective impact of those individual decisions is nearly impossible to measure, says Joanne Padrón Carney, chief governmental relations officer for the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\nhe NSF, for instance, awarded only 1,000 of its Graduate Research Fellowships this year, half of its usual total and the lowest number of awards in 15 years, according to Nature; the NIH canceled a slate of early-career programs. In a spring survey conducted by the American Institute of Physics, 37 percent of department chairs whose programs offer graduate degrees in physics and astronomy said they expected to enroll fewer graduate students in the fall of 2025 than they did last fall,\n\n\nWhat Does It Cost to Run a Lab?

The bill also sends about $10 million more to the National Weather Service and boosts funding for National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n(That is good news?)\n\nAlthough the science funding received bipartisan support, a fight over funding for the new Federal Bureau of Investigations headquarters could tank the legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: How to Wreck the Nation’s Health, by the Numbers\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/30/opinion/hhs-cuts-harming-american-health.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has terminated thousands of grants, including funding for pandemic prevention, and research grants related to cancer, vaccines and chronic diseases. The loss of research funding will delay medical discoveries. Though the agency publishes a weekly list of terminated grants, the full scope of funding cancellations has been obscured, especially at the National Institutes of Health, the major funder of medical research. A database created by Harvard researchers, Grant Watch, has helped to fill in the gaps.\n\n(See the great infographics)\n\nSince President Trump has taken office, H.H.S. has cut over $9.5 billion in grant funding that had been approved but not yet distributed to programs and researchers.

This article uses the Health Systems Performance Assessment Framework to identify key policies regarding resources, financing, governance, and service delivery and their impact on the cost, quality, access, and equity of the US health system. The evaluation is largely negative. The administration, in its very energetic first hundred days, has already undermined resources, financing, and in particular governance in areas as diverse as oversight of long-term care, scientific research, and vaccination policy. Administration rhetoric and budget proposals called for severe reductions in health care access and actions to terminate services for particular groups, such as immigrants or gender minorities. Many of the particular actions, such as mass layoffs of specialist scientific and regulatory staff, will be difficult to reverse.\n\n(On a grid with 64 options, 54 were colored harmful; none beneficial)\n\nShocks to specialist research communities cause rapid attrition, with scientists exiting the workforce and even the country after as little as a month of disrupted funding, and resources diverted from high-quality basic research to privately assigned, less-impactful work.17,18 They may also increase hesitancy around research participation, particularly for groups that are already under-represented in health research. One estimate suggests that the administration’s proposed NIH cuts, over 25 years, will save $500bn and cost the country $8.2 trillion in lost health-a cost more than 16 times greater than the savings, even excluding lost economic benefits from health research.\n\n\nAcross Table 1, the second Trump administration’s record is one of unprecedented damage. Budget proposals that were not enacted but started in the first hundred days would exacerbate the damage through enormous cuts to Medicaid, supplemental nutrition, HHS and NIH. Decentralizing responsibilities to the states will produce less efficiency (due to loss of economies of scale and specialist resources such as laboratories), more variation in state politics, resources, and risks, and more inequality between states.108 Trump is the least popular president in US polling history.109 It remains to be seen whether the majority of Americans will stand up and successfully demand that he change course to reflect their views.\n\n\nNIH Plans to Cap Publisher Fees, Dilute ‘Scientific Elite’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/07/10/nih-plans-cap-publisher-fees-dilute-scientific\n\nThe National Institutes of Health announced a plan Tuesday to implement a cap on the fees publishers can charge NIH-funded researchers to make their work publicly accessible.\n\n\nBoth the updated open-access policy and the NIH’s newly announced publisher fee cap, which takes effect next year, are designed to put some limits on the $19 billion for-profit scholarly publishing industry, which is dominated by a small group of for-profit megapublishers, including Elsevier, Taylor & Francis and Springer Nature. The industry thrives on the unpaid work of scholars—including thousands funded by the NIH and other federal agencies—who rely on publishing their research in prestigious journals to earn tenure, promotion and recognition as leaders in their fields.\n\n\n“I expect the response to this will be that these journals will lose some of their market power,” Bhattacharya told Charlie Kirk, founder of the right-wing group Turning Point USA, in an interview Tuesday. “A lot of their market power has to do with the fact that they bully scientists into paying large fees and essentially end up bullying us.”\n\n\nDuring the pandemic, Bhattacharya, who was a health economist at Stanford University before Trump appointed him director of the NIH, became one of the political right’s favorite examples of how the so-called scientific elite allegedly suppressed nonconformist scientific beliefs. In 2020, he criticized public officials’ recommendations for people to stay home to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus, sparking widespread backlash from other experts—including the officials running the NIH at the time.\n\n\nBut now that he’s in charge of the same agency that dismissed his views as “fringe” nearly five years ago, Bhattacharya has vowed to “establish a culture of respect for free speech in science and scientific dissent at the NIH.”\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation Department Postpones NACIQI Summer Meeting\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/08/education-department-postpones-naciqi-summer-meeting\n\nThe delay means that by the time the panel meets, the terms of six of its 18 members will have expired. The education secretary, House and Senate each appoint six members. In May, Education Secretary Linda McMahon requested nominations to fill six seats in October. Experts and members of the committee are worried that the Trump administration is trying to stack the panel in its favor as decisions about the future of higher education accreditation loom.\n\n\nThe panel, known as the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, advises the department on which independent agencies should have the power to accredit colleges and therefore which colleges should have access to federal aid. At the next meeting, NACIQI is scheduled to decide whether to renew recognition for the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the accreditor for Columbia University.\n\n\nPanel member and chair Zakiya Smith Ellis told the Journal that she is concerned that the Trump administration is “trying to take over this advisory group that is supposed to be in place for our expertise in higher education, not to push a certain political agenda.”\n\n\nFlorida Board of Governors to Vote on New Accreditor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/regional-public-universities/2025/07/11/fla-board-governors-vote-creating-new\n\nThe goal is to accredit six institutions by next summer and secure Department of Education recognition by June 2028, according to the business plan. (A new accreditor typically has two years to prove it is operating in accordance with federal regulations to receive federal approval.)\n\n\nThe Commission for Public Higher Education would be incorporated as a nonprofit organization in Florida, initially funded by a $4 million appropriation from the Florida State Legislature, according to the business plan. Other involved higher ed systems are expected to cough up similar funds. A board of directors representing each of the founding systems would oversee the new accreditor.\n\n\n“CHEA does not believe that states are likely to be effective accreditors,” she wrote. “Historically, states have not had the staff, experience, or knowledge necessary to create a higher education accreditor. It is critically important that higher education reflects an impartial and unbiased accrediting review process that is focused on student learning outcomes. To date, there has not been a state that has accomplished this.”",

OCR also started 26 of what the office calls “directed investigations,” which aren’t based on a specific complaint. Another 3,424 complaints were dismissed “consistent with OCR’s Case Processing Manual,”\n\n\n“The dismissals are high and the case-resolution numbers are low, and I understand the resolutions they count reflect work completed before the [reduction in force],” she said, adding that the 290 resolutions “reflect a shocking diminution of work output from the office.”\n\n\nOglesby didn’t provide any more information about why the complaints were dismissed or what types of violations they focused on.

But the funding for high school equivalency classes, English as a second language programs and other adult education services never arrived.\n\n\n“Initial findings show that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,” wrote the OMB spokesperson, citing examples of states and schools using the money to support students in the country without proper documentation\n\n\n“If funding is not provided, there are nothing but bad options for institutions,” said David Baime, senior vice president for government relations for the American Association of Community Colleges. He predicts community colleges would have to reduce adult education services, lay off personnel and vie for funds to fill in the gap from states and other sources. But even so, “the funding is so substantial in a number of places that there’s no immediate source of replacing that money.”",

The administration has singled out top schools like Harvard, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania. But the bill shows that the Republican agenda for higher education extends far beyond the Ivy League.\n\n\nThe sweeping cuts to Medicaid at the center of the bill could also have ramifications for higher education.

    "text": "How Trump Uses the DOJ as Tool of ‘Fear-Mongering’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/07/trump-deploys-justice-dept-ramp-attacks-higher-ed\n\nWhile traditional DOJ cases can take years to resolve, Bondi’s agency has launched and concluded investigations in a matter of months or even weeks, leaving little room for appeal, negotiation or settlement. That makes it difficult to overlook the possibility that Trump’s efforts to enforce the law on college campuses are part of his calculated clench for control, higher education advocates say.\n\n\n“The DOJ has been involved in higher education before. Up until now, though, I just don’t have a sense that it’s ever been intentionally weaponized for political purposes,” said Peter McDonough, vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education. “We certainly can feel the intensity of focus and the desire for political messaging. There’s a fear factor that clearly has been a motivator and an objective.”\n\n\n“What we’re seeing here is less about enforcement of laws and more about government terrorism,” said Ferise of the Indiana law firm. “By definition terrorism is using intimidation to unlawfully pursue some kind of political gain or vendetta, and I can’t see how this is anything other than that.”\n\n\nHow a Shadowy Online Blacklist Became a Legal Threat to Pro-Palestinian Activists – Mother Jones\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/07/canary-mission-israel-palestine-blacklist-university-trump-deportation-ozturk-khalil/\n\nThe goal, Canary Mission says, is to “ensure that today’s radicals are not tomorrow’s employees” and “combat the rise in anti-Semitism on college campuses.” But lawyers, activists, and critics of the site worry that the consequences could now be more serious than diminished job prospects and that foreign students like Öztürk—who have been rounded up by the Trump administration—may have been targeted for imprisonment and deportation because they were listed on an anonymous blacklisting site. (Öztürk has since been returned to Massachusetts.)\n\n(Several CUNY community members are listed on canary)\n\nWhat’s clear, however, is that Canary Mission has been repeatedly cited in federal lawsuits against student activists and in official US government communications with universities, as the Trump administration detains students with little explanation. Canary Mission’s “about us” page claims its content meets “high standards of accuracy and authenticity,” but the spin it puts on pro-Palestinian activities is hardly objective—especially given the increasingly severe consequences for the people it describes. Attending an antiwar protest, for example, becomes “participation in a pro-Hamas rally;” criticism of Israeli policies is framed as “demonizing Israel.”\n\n\nIt “is not the first,” Lockman said, “but [it is] maybe the most effective.” Today, it holds profiles of more than 1,800 students, 1,100 professors, 300 medical professionals, and 2,100 people simply labeled “professionals.”\n\n\nIn 2018, an investigation by the Forward connected Canary Mission to a registered Israeli nonprofit called Megamot Shalom, or “Peace Trends.” Donations to Canary Mission, the outlet reported, were being routed through Megamot Shalom.\n\n\nThe Israeli nonprofit registry shows that Megamot Shalom, still active seven years after its launch, has only 11 employees. More than 99 percent of its budget—about a million dollars, for fiscal year 2023—comes via donations from abroad.\n\n\nThe Helen Diller Family Foundation listed a donation as “CANARY MISSION FOR MEGAMOT SHALOM” on its publicly accessible tax forms in 2016. (After journalists found the donations, the foundation stopped giving to either organization.) That same year, the Michael and Andrea Leven Family Foundation donated $50,000 to Megamot Shalom, and told a Jewish Currents reporter in 2021 that the money was intended for Canary Mission.\n\n\nMother Jones identified two American foundations that have donated to Canary Mission more recently: the Natan and Lidia Peisach Family Foundation, which donated $100,000 in fiscal year 2023, and the Ann and Robert Fromer Charitable Foundation, which donated $20,000 that same year.\n\n\nAs of 2016, Rabbi Ben Packer was listed as a board member of Megamot Shalom on Israel’s public charity registry. Born in the United States, Packer—who says he was a “rabbi on campus” at Duke University and the University of North Carolina—now runs an ultranationalist youth hostel in Jerusalem and lives in a West Bank settlement. He has boasted of his friendship with Stephen Miller, the Trump adviser behind many of the president’s most controversial immigration policies.\n\n\nAttempts to hold Canary Mission liable for defamation have mostly failed, in part because would-be plaintiffs cannot say conclusively whether or not it is housed in the United States. Kinza Khan, a Pakistani American Muslim woman from\n\n\nSome lawmakers, too, are treating Canary Mission as a legitimate source for triggering government investigations. Last year, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce sent letters to schools like MIT and UC Berkeley inquiring about those institutions’ responses to alleged antisemitism referenced in professors’ Canary Mission profiles.\n\n\nNow, as Republicans move to further restrict citizenship, Canary Mission is supporting a campaign by Rep. Andy Ogles to revoke New York mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani’s citizenship and deport him from this country.\n\n\nAmicus brief by AAUP, Rutgers, Middle East Studies Association\n\nhttps://www.presidentsalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PA-brief.pdf\n(Thanks KB)\n\nAmicus curiae the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration (the “Alliance”) submits this brief to advise the Court of the effects of the administration’s policy of targeting non-citizen students and faculty at institutions of higher education throughout the country based on their political views.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: How Harvard’s Ties to China Helped Make It a White House Target\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/us/harvard-china-white-house-funding.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut American foreign policy has turned sharply hawkish against China, and even though Harvard has steadily reduced its ties there, the Trump administration has made the relationship another line of attack in its broader effort to bring the university to heel. The administration has stripped away billions of dollars in federal research funding and is trying to revoke its right to host international students and also end its nonprofit tax status.\n\n\nAlan M. Garber, the university’s president, has described the administration’s overall assault on the school as a power grab “unmoored from the law, to control teaching and learning at Harvard and to dictate how it operates.”\n\n\nHarvard’s Fight Is a Defense of Democracy and Civic Virtue\n\nhttps://www.liberalcurrents.com/harvards-fight-is-a-defense-of-democracy-and-civic-virtue/\n\nTo some observers, Harvard’s stand might seem like it’s just Ivy League self‑regard, an affluent institution protecting its perks. That reading gets the stakes backward. What is under attack is the rule‑of‑law scaffolding that lets any voluntary association—PTA or synagogue, start‑up or labor union—pursue its mission without waiting for White House permission slips or fearing punitive retaliation. A university that surrenders control over whom it may admit, hire, or teach ceases to be a university; it becomes a subordinate creature of politicians and the ever-changing whims of election results.\n\n\nThe counterexample is on display in another venerable American institution of higher education, the University of Virginia, where president James Ryan proffered his resignation in the face of a targeted pressure campaign from the Trump administration’s Department of Justice, and UVA’s Board of Visitors accepted it. Under the thin pretense of enforcing civil rights laws, the federal government is now essentially dictating policies, curriculum, and personnel according to the political whims of the White House.\n\n\nIt’s not only an outrageous attack on academic freedom, it’s also an attack on the constitutional autonomy of state governments, at the public university Thomas Jefferson was once so proud of chartering he had it inscribed on his grave.\n\n\nYet history warns that trimming our sails in hopes of preserving research dollars often achieves neither independence nor solvency. Ask Central European University. When Hungary’s Viktor Orbán demanded curricular control in 2017, CEU hesitated, negotiated, and was ultimately driven from Budapest anyway. Appeasement bought time but not independence.\n\n\nThe rest of us have a part to play. Other universities can file amicus briefs. Foundations and philanthropists can step in to help keep research going while funding cutoffs are litigated. Alumni can send the signal that integrity in this moment is what keeps their checkbooks open. Ordinary citizens can refuse to sacrifice higher principles on the altar of partisan cultural grievances. Democracy’s immune system is made of these antibodies.\n\n\nTrump administration ups pressure on Harvard with threat to accreditation\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/a60c469b-6c0c-49af-9c9d-6908f4ab6561\nand\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-accreditation-subpoena-trump-00d68304\n\nThe departments of Education and Health and Human Services notified Harvard’s accreditor that a government investigation found the school violated civil-rights law for allegedly failing to protect Jewish students from antisemitic harassment.\n\n\nThe notification doesn’t remove Harvard’s accreditation—which would leave the school virtually unable to operate. Education Secretary Linda McMahon urged Harvard’s accreditor to work with the school to “keep the Department fully informed of its efforts to ensure that Harvard is in compliance with federal law and accreditor standards.”\n\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would subpoena Harvard to obtain records relevant to the enforcement of immigration laws in connection to the school’s international students.\n\nand\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/us/politics/trump-harvard-data-accreditation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe details of those offers were unclear, but Wednesday’s moves from the Trump administration suggested that the government has been dissatisfied with Harvard’s proposals.\n\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s allies view the accreditation system as a potentially powerful tool in the administration’s crusade to upend higher education. Mr. Trump has described accreditation as a “secret weapon.” In April, he signed an executive order directing federal agencies to “promptly” inform accreditors about any schools his administration determines are in violation of civil rights law.\n\n\nThe idea has circulated at the university for several years but gained steam after pro-Palestinian protests began disrupting campus in late 2023\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-conservative-scholarship-center-trump-attacks-a187242a?st=QeDVCt&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nHarvard leaders have discussed creating a program that people briefed on the talks described as a center for conservative scholarship, possibly modeled on Stanford’s Hoover Institution, as the school fights the Trump administration’s accusations that it is too liberal.\n\n\nA spokesman for Harvard said an initiative under discussion “will ensure exposure to the broadest ranges of perspectives on issues, and will not be partisan, but rather will model the use of evidence-based, rigorous logic and a willingness to engage with opposing views.” He added that the school has been accelerating efforts to set up the initiative, which would “promote and support viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\n\n\n*Columbia in Talks With Trump Administration Over Restoring Federal Funding\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-federal-funding-negotiations-deal-trump-consent-decree-88427d9a?st=J62ErS&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nRecent versions of a potential agreement between the school and the government haven’t included a consent decree, according to two of those people. A government task force had initially sought to put the university under a consent decree, which would have put a federal judge in charge of overseeing Columbia’s compliance.\n\n\nMore recent discussions, however, have involved the possibility of a monitor or outside observer who would have less power than a federal judge.\n\n\nColumbia previously agreed to an earlier set of demands from the Trump administration, including restricting masks, empowering campus police with new powers to arrest students, and appointing a senior vice provost with broad authority to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies. But those concessions only kicked off formal negotiations and didn’t restore Columbia’s federal funding.\n\n\n“Our red lines remain the same,” she said. “We must maintain our autonomy and independent governance. We decide who teaches at our institution, what they teach and which students we admit.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump wants more apprenticeships. Indiana is going all in.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/06/trump-apprenticeship-high-school-students-college-alternative/\n\nBut in the United States, the number of apprenticeships for high-schoolers is still tiny, just over one-tenth of a percent of students, according to an estimate by the think tank New America. By contrast, in Switzerland — which has been praised widely for its apprenticeship model, including by U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon — 70 percent of high-schoolers participate. Indiana is among several states, including Colorado, South Carolina and Washington, that have embraced the model and sent delegations to Switzerland to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump staffers who set out to reshape their alma maters\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/11/trump-administration-reshape-alma-mater-universities-harvard/\n\nLess than a decade ago, Gregory W. Brown helped fundraise for the University of Virginia by posing for pictures in his old dorm room.\n\n\nNow he is central to the Trump administration’s effort to crack down on his alma mater for promoting diversity, equity and inclusion programs, as one of two Justice Department leaders and U-Va. alumni to threaten sweeping funding cuts and compel the school’s president to resign.\n\n\nDriven by personal experience, the staffers are pushing to overhaul the progressive culture they feel has come to dominate elite colleges and universities.\n\n\nTogether, the staff under Trump, who prizes his degree from the University of Pennsylvania’s business school, and Vice President JD Vance, who graduated from Yale Law School, are looking to reshape academia — working to purge campuses of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and imbue the next generations of students with their worldview.\n\n\nJust last year, Wasserman was an editor on the Harvard Law Review, one of the nation’s premier legal journals, working out of an academic building in Cambridge where he was socially alienated from his more liberal classmates and frustrated with the focus on selecting diverse voices, four of his former classmates said in interviews. This year, as a policy adviser to the president, he helped launch an investigation into that publication, the New York Times first reported.\n\n\nHarmeet Dhillon, the civil rights division director at the Justice Department who also attended U-Va., shared that frustration.\n\n\nTeaching literature is an exercise in freedom. Now ideological demands from the right are putting it in danger, writes University of VIrginia English professor Mark Edmundson.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/paradise-lost-at-the-university-of-virginia-9e59195a\n\nThe members of the Jefferson Council, a conservative alumni group, have spoken much about the brainwashing and indoctrination they feel goes on in our classrooms. There may be some of that, I’ll concede, but not nearly as much as they imagine. I think that conservative students who bottle themselves up in class are more afraid of their peers’ reactions than their professors. How long before the Board of Visitors, guided by the Jefferson Council, decides it must take an active hand and begin vetting our syllabi?\n\n\nHannah Arendt, the political philosopher, suggests that a politically unanimous condition is always something to fear. When you have a sphere without tensions, without civil conflict, tyranny is in the wings. I fear that we at UVA may be on the verge of such a condition. The road that runs from the White House, to the Justice Department, to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office, to our Board of Visitors looks to be all too smooth. Who is going to stop the call for political conformity as it gathers force?\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration increases scrutiny of another Virginia university\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/10/george-mason-university-dei-probe-trump-administration/\n\nOn Thursday, the Education Department said it had opened its second civil rights investigation in two weeks into George Mason University, this one over the alleged use of race in the hiring and promotion of faculty members. The department said it had received complaints from multiple professors, including about university initiatives to make the demographics of faculty better reflect the diversity of its student body.\n\n\n“This kind of pernicious and wide-spread discrimination — packaged as ‘anti-racism’ — was allowed to flourish under the Biden Administration, but it will not be tolerated by this one,” Craig Trainor, the department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a news release.\n\n\nThis month, the Education Department notified George Mason that it had launched an investigation into the university’s alleged failure to address a hostile environment for Jewish students and faculty.\n\n\nThe stacking of investigations against George Mason follows a similar pattern that occurred in the Trump administration’s inquiries into U-Va.\n\n\nTed Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, said the probes into George Mason show the Trump administration is not interested only in “celebrity universities” like Harvard, and that institutions of higher education nationally will be watching.\n\n\nLast week, as the Education Department’s initial inquiry into George Mason became public, Washington came under fire from various conservative commentators.\n\n\nAn article in City Journal, a publication linked to the conservative think tank Manhattan Institute [Chris Rufo’s fingerprints are here], called Washington a “disastrous president” whose record “warrants his resignation or dismissal.”\n\n(also)\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/george-mason-university-antisemitism-investigation-trump\n(also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/11/george-mason-faces-2-title-vi-investigations?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed\n(also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/an-inside-job",

He doesn’t have ancestry in Austria. And he doesn’t need a master’s—he already has one in a different field. But as one of a growing number of Americans looking to leave the U.S. due to their disagreement with President Trump’s policies, studying abroad seemed like the path of least resistance for emigrating.\n\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, about one in five Americans said they would be interested in moving abroad if their preferred candidate did not win. Following Trump’s victory, the number of Americans searching for study abroad opportunities on the site Studyportals multiplied fivefold. CNBC reported that Google searches for “how to move to Canada” surged, especially in blue states such as Maine, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.\n\n\nWhat Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful’ Bill Means for NYC | THE CITY — NYC News\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/07/07/trump-budget-medicaid-food-stamps-local-impact/\n\nThe law punches a multi-billion dollar hole in the current state budget by reducing federal Medicaid funding, a blow that will almost certainly require Gov. Kathy Hochul to call a special legislative session in the coming months.\n\n\nThe hole gets much bigger in next year’s budget, which needs to be adopted by March 31, as the governor and legislators prepare for their reelection campaigns.\n\n\nThe immediate impact on the city will be less severe, but Mayor Eric Adams and the City Council will eventually be confronted with choices on whether to fill in some of the safety net gaps created by the GOP bill — or reduce aid to poor New Yorkers.\n\n\nUnder the Republican law, New York will lose $7.5 billion used to cover legal immigrants in the Essential Plan, which is almost entirely paid for by the federal government. The state will then have to transfer many of those people to Medicaid, which will cost an additional $2.7 billion, since federal aid for Medicaid only covers about 56% of the actual costs.\n\n\nSince the state’s fiscal year goes to the end of March, the cost in the current budget will be about $2.5 billion. But for the 2027 fiscal year, the cost will be slightly more than $10 billion.\n\n\nNew York will also immediately need to build a system to verify twice a year that Medicaid and SNAP recipients remain eligible by meeting new work requirements. The Hochul Administration estimates the cost at $500 million a year.\n\n\nThe stakes are high. A survey Public Health Solutions conducted of New Yorkers with a household income of less than $60,000 found that 71% would be unable to keep insurance, and 64% said they would be unable to maintain their doctor visits.\n\n\nNYTimes: Why 1.5 Million New Yorkers Could Lose Health Insurance Under Trump Bill\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/nyregion/trump-domestic-policy-bill-new-york-health-care.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn one key respect, the law’s impact will be felt more keenly in New York than in any other state — and it has nothing to do with Medicaid.\n\n\nInstead, it is the result of an obscure federal funding mechanism that sends billions of dollars a year to New York and nothing to most states. That money, which started flowing as a result of the Affordable Care Act, will be reduced drastically under the new law, beginning next year.\n\n\nOverall, the state could absorb a $10 billion hit annually because of the policy law. That reflects a combination of increased state expenditures and cuts in federal subsidies that support health insurance and health care for people with lower incomes.",

There is no other logical explanation.\n\n(Well, the argument of destroying competing power bases is another explanation. If a sharpie can be used to rewrite truth without pesky pushback…)\n\nThe EU is licking its chops over this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. According to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, while on stage at Sorbonne University, the EU Executive Branch has already decided to set up a “super grant” program, aimed at “longer-term perspective to the very best in the field.”\n\n\nthe Commission is authorizing additional funding of $566 million in 2025-2027, making Europe “a magnet for researchers.” This funding is in addition to the European Research Council’s budget of $18 billion for 2021-2027. Moreover, the EU will “enshrine freedom of scientific research into law” via a new enactment. Europe will not compromise on its long-standing principles of academic freedom.\n\n\n“The administration has issued a multi-pronged, anti-science attack on the health sciences.

We’re seeing direct efforts to go after government agencies, universities, cultural institutions, research organizations, advocacy groups and law firms. We’re even seeing challenges to the authority of Congress and the courts to serve as a check on executive power.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: My Brush With Trump’s Thought Police\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/opinion/stiglitz-trump-dei.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Where to categorize this ham-handed attempt to shut down discourse)\n\nThe email arrived in early February from the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen, carrying a blunt message. It informed the organizers of a Danish lecture series — one I was soon scheduled to speak at — that the final portion of American funding would be released only after they signed a statement essentially saying they were in compliance with a U.S. executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n\nBefore the organizers at the University of Southern Denmark could respond, the U.S. State Department sent an even blunter message: The grant was “being terminated for the convenience of the U.S. government.” It concluded by thanking the Danes “for your partnering with the Department of State and God Bless America.”\n\n\nSecond, the cutoff of funding was followed nearly two weeks later by another message to the university. (I viewed copies of all the emails.) It said that a recent court hearing prevented the State Department from holding up congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds and ordered it to make the financing available. It further ordered the department to “provide written notice of this order” to recipients of grants. Notifying the Danish university was as far as the administration went in complying with the court. The remaining funds haven’t been released yet, organizers say — typical of the Trump administration’s defiance of the courts.\n\n\nAnother core element of freedom — indeed something essential to its survival — is that power must be limited; there have to be checks and balances not just within government but within society. I have long warned that the concentration of wealth among a small percentage of the population would provide a fertile field for a demagogue, and that there was an ample supply of people who might play the part.\n\n\nUniversities, which protect academic freedom, are as important to this system of checks and balances as other civil rights protections like freedom of the press.\n\n\nNYU Withholds Diploma Due to Pro-Palestinian Commencement Speech\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/16/nyu-withholds-diploma-due-pro-palestinian-grad-speech\n\nRozos spoke at the ceremony for the university’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study.

Yale’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is also investing $4 million to support graduate students who have lost training and research grants. Similarly, last month Johns Hopkins University announced that it is tapping earnings from its $13.2 billion endowment to give researchers $100,000 each for delayed grants, or $150,000 for terminated grants, during a 12-month period. And Northwestern University—which hasn’t received any grant payments from the National Institutes of Health since March—is offering faculty up to $50,000 to maintain projects for up to one year.\n\n(Hopefully CUNY will be providing some relief in this manner as well)\n\nOver the past several decades, universities have already substantially increased the amount of money they spend on their own research and development—from 10 percent of the total in 1970 to 25 percent in 2023, according to federal data. Meanwhile, federal support for academic research has been on the decline, falling from 71 percent to 55 percent during that same timeframe. And support from industry, charities and other sources have always been marginal, collectively making up about 15 percent of contributions to research funding at colleges and universities in 2023.\n\n\nWhile that won’t cover all of the terminated grants, “the bridge has to go somewhere,” he said, explaining that the program isn’t supporting projects that don’t have viable alternative long-term funding options. Instead, “we’re providing funding for projects where the faculty member has other sources of funding and other proposals with the same or different federal agencies,” Díaz de la Rubia said.

In Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, published as short stories in the late 1940s and as a novel in 1953, warned not only of the destruction of books, but of a society in which people had lost the desire to read them. The parallel today is not only the administration’s effort to destroy and suppress knowledge, but also the institution’s willingness to accept the cultivated irrelevance of it—a challenge that undermines any serious effort to conduct research, inform policy, or guide public institutions.\n\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF)—established as an independent agency through the National Science Act of 1950 and marking its 75th anniversary this week—traces its roots to Vannevar Bush’s landmark report, “Science, the Endless Frontier,” addressed to President Harry S. Truman. But we might also see the establishment of this premier research institution as reflecting a response to fears depicted by Bradbury. The NSF can be understood not only as a catalyst of scientific promise for national purpose, but also as a guarded response to fears about centralized control over knowledge and thought, shaped by the dark shadows of the Third Reich and the emerging Red Scare.\n\n\nLast week, as the Board held its 494th meeting, I listened to NSF staff say that DOGE had by fiat the authority to give thumbs up or down to grant applications which had been systematically vetted by layers of subject matter experts.\n\n\nOur closed-to-the-public deliberations were observed by Zachary Terrell from the DOGE team. Through his Zoom screen, Terrell showed more interest in his water bottle and his cuticles than in the discussion. According to Nature Terrell, listed as a “consultant” in the NSF directory, had accessed the NSF awards system to block the dispersal of approved grants. The message I received was that the National Science Board had a role to play in name only.\n\n\nAll of this is threatened by the creeping normalization of authoritarian approaches to knowledge management and academic freedom. The National Science Board has not been disbanded like so many other statutorily established, independent agencies in the federal government. But preservation of form provides little consolation when function has been strategically neutralized, mirroring the backsliding that scholars have thoroughly documented: maintaining legitimacy for institutions that no longer honor their founding purposes. This hollowing out is not just about governance in the abstract, it has material consequences for which research questions get asked, which datasets get produced, which knowledge gets produced, and which perspectives shape our understanding of pressing societal challenges. It has consequences for the integrity of knowledge itself.\n\n\nLast week, the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, was summarily dismissed via an email addressed to “Carla” from a White House HR administrator. The Trump Administration claimed that she was fired for “things she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.” It is true that Hayden was repeatedly on record as saying the Library should be for all Americans. And it is false that the Library, which is intended to hold all books published in the United States, lends books to children. The ouster of Hayden is part of a broader pattern of political targeting of women and Black public servants across the federal government.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Cancels Scores of Grants to Study Online Misinformation\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/trump-online-misinformation-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast month, the National Science Foundation, a government agency that finances much of the scientific research in the United States, began canceling hundreds of grants. Most focused on studies involving issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, but scores singled out work on online content.\n\n\nThe cancellation has jeopardized research in universities in virtually every state, leaving researchers scrambling to find funding for projects that in many cases are only partly completed.\n\n\nEach Friday since then, the foundation has announced new cancellations. It has now cut more than 1,400 grants, including 75 more last Friday. In all, the grants were worth more than $1 billion, according to a list compiled by two researchers, Scott W. Delaney, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health, and Noam Ross, the executive director of rOpenSci, a nonprofit software foundation. None of the grant abstracts reviewed by The New York Times called for censoring content.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Cuts Off Budding CUNY Scientists From Mentorship and Aid\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/05/14/cuny-urise-science-research-nih-trump/\n\nThe Trump administration has cut off support that has sustained a teaching model that for decades has been instrumental in catapulting students into careers as scientists.\n\n\nFunded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE) supports the pursuit of advanced degrees by students in the biomedical field, who are offered tuition assistance, mentorship, registration to professional conferences and, crucially, lab experience.\n\n\nNIH canceled all U-RISE funding at City College, Queens College, Brooklyn College, Lehman College and Medgar Evers College. … Professors who work with students in the program say the federal defunding will likely doom the program, and with it vital opportunities to conduct research while attending a public college — putting them on track for further academic research.\n\n\n“University leadership is working to support everyone in our community and will pursue every avenue available to sustain CUNY as a preeminent research institution,” wrote Noah Gardy.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEH Announces Grant Opportunity to Create Statues of Iconic Americans for the National Garden of American Heroes | National Endowment for the Humanities\n\nhttps://www.neh.gov/news/neh-announces-grant-opportunity-create-statues-iconic-americans-national-garden-american\n(This isn’t new, but still galling)\n\nThe NIH Is Requiring Grantees to Follow Trump’s Anti-Trans Executive Order\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-nih-is-requiring-grantees-to-follow-trumps-anti-trans-executive-order\n\nAnd she [researcher at a teaching hospital] learned that the grantee was expected to comply with the gender-equity law Title IX — “including the requirements set forth in Presidential Executive Order 14168 titled Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” That’s the executive order President Trump signed on the first day of his second term, directing the government to recognize two sexes, male and female.\n\n\nThe new policies apply to institutions that accept funds on scientists’ behalf, according to two lawyers who reviewed the language. So if a university accepts a grant with these terms, it could be at risk if the government considers anyone at that campus — not just the scientist spending the money — to be perpetuating “DEI” or “gender ideology extremism.”\n\n\nThe NIH reserves the right to “terminate financial assistance awards and recover all funds,” states its April 21 policy on diversity. And the term sheet citing the anti-transgender executive order states that payments “are predicated on compliance with the above requirements.” It says that violators can be held liable criminally as well as under the False Claims Act, the anti-government defraudment law.\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Association of American Universities, which represents research universities, said that the organization was aware of the language, but declined to comment further.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Nominates Iowa Regent to be Assistant Secretary of Postsecondary Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/12/trump-nominates-assistant-secretary-postsecondary-ed\n\n[David] Barker would focus on improving outcomes and accountability by reforming accreditation, improving federal student aid programs and ensuring grant programs match the Trump administration’s priorities.\n\n\nBarker was an Iowa regent for six years where he advanced cost control measures, promoted academic freedom and ended “discriminatory DEI programs,” according to the release.\n\n(On wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_R._Barker] we can read about what planet this guy lives on: “Barker is the author of Welcome to Free America, a book set in 2057 as a guide to immigrants coming to the former United States after the collapse of government.

Harvard University alone could lose over $2 billion. And every Ivy but Dartmouth is being investigated over allegations that they have allowed antisemitism on campus.\n\n\nAnd Dr. Beilock appears to have carefully positioned her school in territory friendly to conservatives.

The change, according to the NSF, “is intended to streamline funding practices, increase transparency, and ensure that more resources are directed toward direct scientific and engineering research activities.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQatar has showered money on the U.S.’s military and universities, giving the tiny Gulf state outsize geopolitical clout\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/qatar-us-influence-spending-7a64dd75?st=JmAtR8&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nAround the same time that the base was gearing up, Qatar began paying top U.S. universities to operate campuses on Qatari territory. It is now the single largest foreign funder of American universities, according to U.S. Education Department data, providing more than $6 billion over the past 15 years through gifts or contracts with schools including Cornell, Georgetown and Northwestern.\n\n\nThe outsize higher-education funding levels have drawn criticism since the start of Israel’s war in Gaza from Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration over allegations that the money from Qatar and other Arab states was skewing teaching about Israel and the region. Education Secretary Linda McMahon singled out Qatar in an April 23 statement on an executive order expanding oversight on foreign education gifts.\n\n\nAnsari denied that Qatar interferes in the curriculum of any U.S. educational institution or has any influence on U.S. universities, calling that “deliberate misinformation” by “a campaign of bad actors” aiming to weaken the U.S. relationship and undermine Qatar’s mediation role in the Gaza war.\n\n(Not simply fake news, but bad actors)\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: The World Is Wooing U.S. Researchers Shunned by Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/business/economy/trump-research-brain-drain.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nNYTimes: We Study Fascism.

The university, it alleged, had violated Title IX by allowing transgender female students in women’s restrooms, locker rooms, and dorm rooms.\n\n\nPayton McNabb, a former student whose complaints about WCU’s transgender policies brought conservative media attention to the university, said she didn’t experience WCU as quiet. She felt professors treated conservative students differently, and she was hurt by a university Title IX investigation into her conduct after she posted a video of herself asking a transgender woman why she was in a women’s bathroom on campus.\n\n\nThe emails that seem to have triggered the Department of Education’s investigation have been framed by Speech First [a group dedicated to protecting the expression of certain conservative stances at colleges] as evidence that WCU is deliberately defying President Donald Trump.\n\n\nThe Department of Education’s scrutiny “feels punitive,” Gómez [secretary for the Faculty Senate] said. “It feels like this is part of a trend to both try to dismantle higher education and to ultimately undermine faculty governance and academic freedom.” The department’s Title IX investigation is related to faculty governance, Gómez said, because the Faculty Senate had previously supported an effort to make campus bathrooms more welcoming to transgender people.\n\n\nOn Student Aid, It’s Congressional Republicans vs. DOGE\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/on-student-aid-its-congressional-republicans-vs-doge\n\nThe House Committee on Education & Workforce recently drafted legislation that would cut $350 billion in student aid. The savings come mostly from increasing loan-payment requirements and making it harder to qualify for Pell Grants. As others have explained, these measures will harm the lowest-income borrowers and reduce college access. If the committee has its way, the cuts will be bundled into a reconciliation bill in which these savings would pay for tax cuts tilted heavily toward the wealthy.\n\n\nanother surprising roadblock to the House accountability provisions should loom large: …DOGE. … Now that DOGE has forced out half the Education Department’s staff and President Trump is looking to eviscerate it, such execution will be out of reach. In other words, today’s Republican Party has a lot of different factions, but they can’t all win: If conservative lawmakers mean for the department to implement the accountability ideas in their current proposal, they will need to confront the Trump administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nSurely Not?\n\nhttps://www.nybooks.com/articles/2025/05/29/surely-not-manchurian-candidate-president/\n(VAC says this is worth reading, though it is behind a paywall.)\n\nImagine that the president of the United States was a “Manchurian candidate,” an embedded foreign agent determined to wreak maximum damage on the country and limited only by the need not to act so outrageously and preposterously as to blow his cover.

It informed the organizers of a Danish lecture series — one I was soon scheduled to speak at — that the final portion of American funding would be released only after they signed a statement essentially saying they were in compliance with a U.S. executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n\nBefore the organizers at the University of Southern Denmark could respond, the U.S. State Department sent an even blunter message: The grant was “being terminated for the convenience of the U.S. government.” It concluded by thanking the Danes “for your partnering with the Department of State and God Bless America.”\n\n\nSecond, the cutoff of funding was followed nearly two weeks later by another message to the university. (I viewed copies of all the emails.) It said that a recent court hearing prevented the State Department from holding up congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds and ordered it to make the financing available. It further ordered the department to “provide written notice of this order” to recipients of grants. Notifying the Danish university was as far as the administration went in complying with the court. The remaining funds haven’t been released yet, organizers say — typical of the Trump administration’s defiance of the courts.\n\n\nAnother core element of freedom — indeed something essential to its survival — is that power must be limited; there have to be checks and balances not just within government but within society. I have long warned that the concentration of wealth among a small percentage of the population would provide a fertile field for a demagogue, and that there was an ample supply of people who might play the part.\n\n\nUniversities, which protect academic freedom, are as important to this system of checks and balances as other civil rights protections like freedom of the press.\n\n\nNYU Withholds Diploma Due to Pro-Palestinian Commencement Speech\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/16/nyu-withholds-diploma-due-pro-palestinian-grad-speech\n\nRozos spoke at the ceremony for the university’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study.

Yale’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is also investing $4 million to support graduate students who have lost training and research grants. Similarly, last month Johns Hopkins University announced that it is tapping earnings from its $13.2 billion endowment to give researchers $100,000 each for delayed grants, or $150,000 for terminated grants, during a 12-month period. And Northwestern University—which hasn’t received any grant payments from the National Institutes of Health since March—is offering faculty up to $50,000 to maintain projects for up to one year.\n\n(Hopefully CUNY will be providing some relief in this manner as well)\n\nOver the past several decades, universities have already substantially increased the amount of money they spend on their own research and development—from 10 percent of the total in 1970 to 25 percent in 2023, according to federal data. Meanwhile, federal support for academic research has been on the decline, falling from 71 percent to 55 percent during that same timeframe.

Thanks VAC)\n\n\n\n\nWhy I’m Resigning from the NSF and Library of Congress | TIME\n\nhttps://time.com/7285045/resigning-national-science-foundation-library-congress/\n\nFreedom of expression is not merely an abstract principle, or even a constitutional right, but a practical necessity for meaningful advisory work. In Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, published as short stories in the late 1940s and as a novel in 1953, warned not only of the destruction of books, but of a society in which people had lost the desire to read them. The parallel today is not only the administration’s effort to destroy and suppress knowledge, but also the institution’s willingness to accept the cultivated irrelevance of it—a challenge that undermines any serious effort to conduct research, inform policy, or guide public institutions.\n\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF)—established as an independent agency through the National Science Act of 1950 and marking its 75th anniversary this week—traces its roots to Vannevar Bush’s landmark report, “Science, the Endless Frontier,” addressed to President Harry S. Truman. But we might also see the establishment of this premier research institution as reflecting a response to fears depicted by Bradbury. The NSF can be understood not only as a catalyst of scientific promise for national purpose, but also as a guarded response to fears about centralized control over knowledge and thought, shaped by the dark shadows of the Third Reich and the emerging Red Scare.\n\n\nLast week, as the Board held its 494th meeting, I listened to NSF staff say that DOGE had by fiat the authority to give thumbs up or down to grant applications which had been systematically vetted by layers of subject matter experts.\n\n\nOur closed-to-the-public deliberations were observed by Zachary Terrell from the DOGE team. Through his Zoom screen, Terrell showed more interest in his water bottle and his cuticles than in the discussion. According to Nature Terrell, listed as a “consultant” in the NSF directory, had accessed the NSF awards system to block the dispersal of approved grants. The message I received was that the National Science Board had a role to play in name only.\n\n\nAll of this is threatened by the creeping normalization of authoritarian approaches to knowledge management and academic freedom. The National Science Board has not been disbanded like so many other statutorily established, independent agencies in the federal government. But preservation of form provides little consolation when function has been strategically neutralized, mirroring the backsliding that scholars have thoroughly documented: maintaining legitimacy for institutions that no longer honor their founding purposes. This hollowing out is not just about governance in the abstract, it has material consequences for which research questions get asked, which datasets get produced, which knowledge gets produced, and which perspectives shape our understanding of pressing societal challenges. It has consequences for the integrity of knowledge itself.\n\n\nLast week, the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, was summarily dismissed via an email addressed to “Carla” from a White House HR administrator. The Trump Administration claimed that she was fired for “things she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.” It is true that Hayden was repeatedly on record as saying the Library should be for all Americans. And it is false that the Library, which is intended to hold all books published in the United States, lends books to children. The ouster of Hayden is part of a broader pattern of political targeting of women and Black public servants across the federal government.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Cancels Scores of Grants to Study Online Misinformation\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/trump-online-misinformation-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast month, the National Science Foundation, a government agency that finances much of the scientific research in the United States, began canceling hundreds of grants. Most focused on studies involving issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, but scores singled out work on online content.\n\n\nThe cancellation has jeopardized research in universities in virtually every state, leaving researchers scrambling to find funding for projects that in many cases are only partly completed.\n\n\nEach Friday since then, the foundation has announced new cancellations. It has now cut more than 1,400 grants, including 75 more last Friday. In all, the grants were worth more than $1 billion, according to a list compiled by two researchers, Scott W. Delaney, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health, and Noam Ross, the executive director of rOpenSci, a nonprofit software foundation. None of the grant abstracts reviewed by The New York Times called for censoring content.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Cuts Off Budding CUNY Scientists From Mentorship and Aid\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/05/14/cuny-urise-science-research-nih-trump/\n\nThe Trump administration has cut off support that has sustained a teaching model that for decades has been instrumental in catapulting students into careers as scientists.\n\n\nFunded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE) supports the pursuit of advanced degrees by students in the biomedical field, who are offered tuition assistance, mentorship, registration to professional conferences and, crucially, lab experience.\n\n\nNIH canceled all U-RISE funding at City College, Queens College, Brooklyn College, Lehman College and Medgar Evers College. … Professors who work with students in the program say the federal defunding will likely doom the program, and with it vital opportunities to conduct research while attending a public college — putting them on track for further academic research.\n\n\n“University leadership is working to support everyone in our community and will pursue every avenue available to sustain CUNY as a preeminent research institution,” wrote Noah Gardy.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEH Announces Grant Opportunity to Create Statues of Iconic Americans for the National Garden of American Heroes | National Endowment for the Humanities\n\nhttps://www.neh.gov/news/neh-announces-grant-opportunity-create-statues-iconic-americans-national-garden-american\n(This isn’t new, but still galling)\n\nThe NIH Is Requiring Grantees to Follow Trump’s Anti-Trans Executive Order\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-nih-is-requiring-grantees-to-follow-trumps-anti-trans-executive-order\n\nAnd she [researcher at a teaching hospital] learned that the grantee was expected to comply with the gender-equity law Title IX — “including the requirements set forth in Presidential Executive Order 14168 titled Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” That’s the executive order President Trump signed on the first day of his second term, directing the government to recognize two sexes, male and female.\n\n\nThe new policies apply to institutions that accept funds on scientists’ behalf, according to two lawyers who reviewed the language. So if a university accepts a grant with these terms, it could be at risk if the government considers anyone at that campus — not just the scientist spending the money — to be perpetuating “DEI” or “gender ideology extremism.”\n\n\nThe NIH reserves the right to “terminate financial assistance awards and recover all funds,” states its April 21 policy on diversity. And the term sheet citing the anti-transgender executive order states that payments “are predicated on compliance with the above requirements.” It says that violators can be held liable criminally as well as under the False Claims Act, the anti-government defraudment law.\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Association of American Universities, which represents research universities, said that the organization was aware of the language, but declined to comment further.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Nominates Iowa Regent to be Assistant Secretary of Postsecondary Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/12/trump-nominates-assistant-secretary-postsecondary-ed\n\n[David] Barker would focus on improving outcomes and accountability by reforming accreditation, improving federal student aid programs and ensuring grant programs match the Trump administration’s priorities.\n\n\nBarker was an Iowa regent for six years where he advanced cost control measures, promoted academic freedom and ended “discriminatory DEI programs,” according to the release.\n\n(On wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_R._Barker] we can read about what planet this guy lives on: “Barker is the author of Welcome to Free America, a book set in 2057 as a guide to immigrants coming to the former United States after the collapse of government. It describes a difficult period of transition, but eventually, private companies take over functions previously performed by governments, such as security, dispute resolution, production of money and infrastructure, and national defense.”)\n\n\n\n\nThe hidden ways Trump, DOGE are shutting down parts of the U.S. government\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/05/11/trump-government-operations-halt-funding-cuts/\n(Nothing higher ed related, but similar things are reported with grants.

The university, it alleged, had violated Title IX by allowing transgender female students in women’s restrooms, locker rooms, and dorm rooms.\n\n\nPayton McNabb, a former student whose complaints about WCU’s transgender policies brought conservative media attention to the university, said she didn’t experience WCU as quiet. She felt professors treated conservative students differently, and she was hurt by a university Title IX investigation into her conduct after she posted a video of herself asking a transgender woman why she was in a women’s bathroom on campus.\n\n\nThe emails that seem to have triggered the Department of Education’s investigation have been framed by Speech First [a group dedicated to protecting the expression of certain conservative stances at colleges] as evidence that WCU is deliberately defying President Donald Trump.\n\n\nThe Department of Education’s scrutiny “feels punitive,” Gómez [secretary for the Faculty Senate] said. “It feels like this is part of a trend to both try to dismantle higher education and to ultimately undermine faculty governance and academic freedom.” The department’s Title IX investigation is related to faculty governance, Gómez said, because the Faculty Senate had previously supported an effort to make campus bathrooms more welcoming to transgender people.\n\n\nOn Student Aid, It’s Congressional Republicans vs. DOGE\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/on-student-aid-its-congressional-republicans-vs-doge\n\nThe House Committee on Education & Workforce recently drafted legislation that would cut $350 billion in student aid. The savings come mostly from increasing loan-payment requirements and making it harder to qualify for Pell Grants. As others have explained, these measures will harm the lowest-income borrowers and reduce college access. If the committee has its way, the cuts will be bundled into a reconciliation bill in which these savings would pay for tax cuts tilted heavily toward the wealthy.\n\n\nanother surprising roadblock to the House accountability provisions should loom large: …DOGE. … Now that DOGE has forced out half the Education Department’s staff and President Trump is looking to eviscerate it, such execution will be out of reach. In other words, today’s Republican Party has a lot of different factions, but they can’t all win: If conservative lawmakers mean for the department to implement the accountability ideas in their current proposal, they will need to confront the Trump administration.",

The sooner that people rally in coordination and in principled defense of the Constitution and the rule of law, the better the prospect that they will be able to contain and reverse the authoritarian project.\n\n\nNYTimes: What Happened When Trump Altered the Deal With Law Firms and Universities\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/europe/what-happened-when-trump-altered-the-deal-with-law-firms-and-universities.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(In short, the prisoner’s dilemma doesn’t apply when negotiating with the mafia.)\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Battles Academia, but Especially the Ivy League\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/us/politics/trump-ivy-league.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nTimothy L. O’Brien, a biographer of Mr. Trump, said the president’s ire about the upper echelon of academia was not surprising. “He has a long track record of criticizing elites that he desperately wants to be accepted by,” Mr. O’Brien said. As far as the Ivy League, he said, “he could barely wait to get in himself.”\n\n(Not sure this is why; I personally believe things are related to a desire to control competing power bases.)\n\n\n\nPresident Trump fires Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden | AP News\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-library-of-congress-carla-hayden-20a1862ce6d2e0d51a84a37b264ce2ef\n\nNYTimes: Trump Declares High-Speed Internet Program ‘Racist’ and ‘Unconstitutional’\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/politics/trump-biden-digital-equity-act.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas lawmakers moving to greatly increase control of state universities\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4d48IaK\n\nConservative lawmakers, who control all levers of government, are advancing a measure they say would hold institutions more accountable and ensure curriculum is “free from ideological bias.” Faculty could be removed or face civil penalties for violations. Schools that fail to comply could be barred from spending state funds.\n\n\nOpponents say the result would essentially be a takeover of the state’s 126 public universities, community college districts and medical schools, with state officials even allowed to overturn hiring decisions. They fear it could damage the institutions’ reputations and lead to a faculty brain drain.\n\n\nHis (Brandon Creighton) new proposal aims to decrease the power of faculty senates, requiring that half of their members be appointed by school presidents. All would be term-limited, advisory only and removable by top administrators for “political advocacy.”\n\n\nAnother provision would give the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board — composed of nine gubernatorial appointees — the ultimate say in faculty and academic screening. The board would pay special attention to schools’ required core curriculum, to ensure they “do not require or attempt to require a student to adopt a belief that any race, sex, or ethnicity or social, political, or religious belief is inherently superior.”\n\n\nComplaints lodged against professors would be investigated by a new state ombudsman and the attorney general, currently Ken Paxton (R), an ultraconservative Trump ally.\n\n\n“Texas is as broad-reaching a legislative endeavor as we’ve seen,” he (Professor Peter Lake, Stetson University) said. And combined with Trump’s attacks on higher education, the legislation is likely to “embolden red states to experiment with even more control over institutional autonomy, right down to curriculum, hiring and firing, tenure, curriculum review.”\n\n\nUT System Chancellor James B.

That could be devastating for low-income students and the institutions that serve them.\n\n\nHe [sample impacted student] credits his success at Bemidji to TRIO, a federally funded initiative dating back to the 1960s that supports low-income, first-generation college students and students with disabilities as they navigate academic life—and that currently faces an existential threat from the Trump administration.\n\n\n“Today, the pendulum has swung and access to college is not the obstacle it was for students of limited means,” officials wrote in the proposal [Trump budget opening salvo]. “A renewed focus on academics and scholastic accomplishment by [institutions], rather than engaging in woke ideology with federal taxpayer subsidies, would be a welcome change.”\n\n\n\n\nACE’s summary of “STUDENT SUCCESS AND TAXPAYER SAVINGS PLAN” that moves to the House Budget Committee (thanks CMR)\n\nhttps://www.acenet.edu/Documents/Summary-Student-Success-Taxpayer-Savings-Plan.pdf\n(Yes, the name shows the crazy stretching of the all-too elastic phrase “student success”)\nIt includes: Pell Grant restrictions; Loan program eliminations; New repayment plan; Risk-sharing requirement; Regulatory constraints.\nKey parts for Pell\n\nChanges full-time status from 24 semester hours or 36 quarter credit hours to 30 semester hours or 45 quarter credit hours;\n\n(From 12 to 15 credits for CUNY making full time much more out of reach for many of our students)\n\nRequiring that a student who applies for federal student aid be a citizen or a national of the United States or be an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act; and\n\n\nThese provisions would take effect on July 1, 2025, and apply to the 2025-2026 academic year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Trump’s Proposed Budget Cuts Mean for Education, Research (aims to cut at least $163 billion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/05/02/trump-proposes-deep-cuts-education-and-research\n(I’d argue even phrasing this as a planned cut, rather than merely an assault is a mistake, but….)\n\nThe proposed budget plan slashes nearly $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health, $12 billion from the Education Department and nearly $5 billion from the National Science Foundation. The skinny budget also eliminates funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, AmeriCorps, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has already made deep cuts at those agencies and put most—if not all—of their employees on leave.\n\n\nTo compensate for the cuts to programs that directly support students or institutions, the administration argued colleges, states and local communities should on take that responsibility. Other justifications for the cuts reflect the administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and higher ed.\n\n(Again, “crackdown” is far too fair a term here.)\n\nAdditionally, the administration wants to cut the Office for Civil Rights’ budget by $49 million, or 35 percent. The budget document says this cut will refocus OCR “away from DEI and Title IX transgender cases.” In recent years, the Biden administration pleaded with Congress to boost OCR’s funding in order to address an increasing number of complaints. The office received 22,687 complaints in fiscal year 2024, and the Biden administration projected that number to grow to nearly 24,000 in 2025.\n\n\n“The budget cuts funding for: climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and programs in low priority areas of science,” the officials wrote in budget documents. “NSF has fueled research with dubious public value, like speculative impacts from extreme climate scenarios and niche social studies.”\n\n(There is too much there to even unpack; I’ll just note that this was preceded by “we must change course and reorient taxpayer dollars toward proven programs that generate results for American students.”)\n\nThe plan would consolidate NIH programs into five areas: the National Institute on Body Systems Research, the National Institute on Neuroscience and Brain Research, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Institute of Disability Related Research, and the National Institute on Behavioral Health.\n\n\n“The administration is committed to restoring accountability, public trust, and transparency at the NIH,” officials wrote. “NIH has broken the trust of the American people with wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.”\n\n(More nonsense in this “skinny budget”)\n\n\n\n\nUnder Trump, National Science Foundation Cuts Off All Funding to Scientists | Scientific American\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01396-2\n(Only until further notice, as if law breakers mean what they write)\n\nThe policy prevents the NSF, one of the world’s biggest supporters of basic research, from awarding new research grants and from supplying allotted funds for existing grants, such as those that receive yearly increments of money.

The current directors and deputy directors will lose their titles and might be reassigned to other positions at the agency or elsewhere in the federal government.\n\n\nThe consolidation appears to be driven in part by President Donald Trump’s proposal to cut the agency’s $9 billion budget by 55% for the 2026 fiscal year that begins on 1 October.\n\n\nThe agency is also expected to issue another round of notices tomorrow terminating grants that have already been awarded, sources say.

More information on the appeals process can be found here. When appealing any grant termination, be sure to emphasize how this loss may impact not only your research but your reputation, opportunities passed up to take on the grant-funded project, and the loss of future opportunities that the grant might have made possible. Please remember that our colleagues at NEH – those who remain – are devastated by the current situation and are themselves overwhelmed.

Now, investigating discrimination in schools is practically “impossible.”\n\n\nIn South Dakota, the OCR abruptly terminated its work with a school district that had agreed to take steps to end discrimination against its Native American students. The same office that helped craft the agreement to treat indigenous students equally made a stunning about-face and decided in March that helping Native American students would discriminate against white students.\n\n\nOne OCR attorney, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, told ProPublica that their caseload went from 60 to 380 as they absorbed cases previously handled by employees who worked in offices that had been closed.\n\n\n“OCR is the most useless it’s ever been, and it’s the most dangerous it’s ever been. And by useless, I mean unavailable. Unable to do the work,”\n\n\nInvestigating cases that allege racism, discrimination based on sexual orientation or mistreatment of students with disabilities now requires permission from Trump appointees, according to a memo from OCR leadership. As a result, thousands of discrimination investigations are idled, even ones that were nearing a resolution when Trump took office again.\n\n\nInvestigations being publicized now have largely bypassed the agency’s civil rights attorneys, according to Education Department employees.

So too must be the student body, staff and leadership. A failing grade, the letter warned, would result in corrective measures, including the deliberate recruiting of “a critical mass” of new faculty and students to correct the imbalance.\n\n\nHarvard has rejected the Trump administration’s demands, calling them a threat to academic freedom and the political independence of higher education. But in a letter to Harvard affiliates informing them that the university was suing the government, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, echoed that vocabulary.\n\n\n“We acknowledge that we have unfinished business,” Dr. Garber wrote. “We need to ensure that the university lives up to its steps to reaffirm a culture of free inquiry, viewpoint diversity and academic exploration.”\n\n\nHarvard itself has been a hotbed of diverse views about the value of viewpoint diversity and its relationship to the bedrock value of academic freedom. But there’s broad agreement that the Trump administration is weaponizing the term — which its letter never defines — in a dangerous way.\n\n\nThe term viewpoint diversity began gaining currency across academia largely through the efforts of Heterodox Academy, a nonpartisan national group founded in 2015 to combat what it describes as “the rise of closed-minded orthodoxies within scholarly communities.”\n\n\nIn recent years, it has been picked up by Republican politicians, as a new tool to support their longstanding argument that universities have been taken over by the left.\n\n\nA report last October by the free expression group PEN America said that viewpoint diversity, while a laudable goal, has too often served as “camouflage” for the real purpose: stifling faculty members’ speech.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Disqualifies Harvard From Future Research Grants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/trump-harvard-research-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThe letter is as they say meshuga\nhttps://x.com/EDSecMcMahon/status/1919517481313427594\nMy favorite is to now blame it on the math\n\nWhy is it, we ask, that Harvard has to teach simple and basic mathematics, when it is supposedly so hard to get into this “acclaimed university”?

And in other circumstances, I would have been like, holy cow. But given what the administration has done over the past three and a half months, it’s not clear to me that it changes the administration’s posture.”\n\n\nTrump administration calls for a freeze on all new grants to Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/05/harvard-new-grants-freeze-trump/\n\nMcMahon’s letter displays an astonishing and frankly disqualifying level of ignorance — about Harvard, about how federal research funding works, and about the plain text of the U.S. Constitution,” Weld (AAUP President of Harvard chapter) said. “The entire higher ed sector must reject this crude authoritarianism with one voice.”\n\n\nTed Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, said, “I think we should all be looking at the interchange between the department, Harvard and the White House as harbingers of things to come.” \n\n\nLarry Summers, former president of Harvard, said the Trump administration’s fight with the Ivy League university has larger implications for civil society. “This is about whether the government has the power to coerce private institutions, using all the various authorities it has to advance particular political agendas of the president,” he said. “But for higher education, this is about academic freedom, which for the better part of a century, the Supreme Court recognized as intimately connected to the First Amendment. So in a broad civic sense, it’s about our commitment to constitutional democracy as manifest in the First Amendment.”\n\n\nTrump Finally Drops the Anti-Semitism Pretext – The latest letter to Harvard makes clear that the administration’s goal is to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal.

But the most notable thing about it is what it leaves out.\n\n\nTo hear McMahon tell it, Harvard is a university on the verge of ruin. (I say McMahon because her signature is at the bottom of the letter, but portions of the document are written in such a distinctive idiolect—“Why is there so much HATE?” the letter asks; it signs off with “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”—that one detects the spirit of a certain uncredited co-author.)\n\n\nWhat you will not find in the McMahon letter is any mention of the original justification for the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on elite universities: anti-Semitism.\n\n\nNow, however, the mask is off. Aside from one oblique reference to congressional hearings about anti-Semitism (“the great work of Congresswoman Elise Stefanik”), the letter is silent on the subject. The administration is no longer pretending that it is standing up for Jewish students. The project has been revealed for what it is: an effort to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal.\n\n\n“There’s no ‘We don’t like you’ authority in the federal Constitution or in statutory law. In fact, quite the opposite: You’re precluded from that.” [Derek Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina]\n\n\nHarvard Faculty Pledge 10% of Their Salary to Defend Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/06/harvard-faculty-pledge-10-salary-defend-against-trump\n\nNearly 100 senior faculty members at Harvard have committed to taking a pay cut to support the institution’s legal defense against the federal government.\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Leaders See Only Bad Outcomes Ahead as They Battle Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/harvard-trump-court-case-negotiation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut behind the scenes, several senior officials at Harvard and on its top governing board believe that the university is confronting a crisis that could last until President Trump is out of power, according to three people involved in the discussions. Even if Harvard’s legal case is successful, these officials say, the school will still face enormous troubles that may force the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university to rethink its identity and scale.\n\nSo says\n\nThey spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss school officials’ private deliberations.\n\n\nThe crosscurrents are unlike any that the university has faced in its modern history. For centuries, Harvard has cherished its independence, its swaggering pride and its record of academic excellence. But Mr. Trump has reveled in unleashing chaos that many believe will be difficult to contain as long as he sees the university as a target.\n\n\nThe corporation [the board that oversees the university] has told the school’s lawyers not to engage with the Trump administration, according to the two people involved in discussions.\n\n\nComplicating matters is whether the White House will honor a deal.\n\n\nLawrence H. Summers, a former Harvard president, said … “It would be a tragedy if Harvard resolved this in a way that gave support and encouragement to the idea of extralegal extortion.”\n\n\nThe Trump administration this week reiterated its aim to inflict as much damage as possible, when Ms. McMahon fired off a letter telling Harvard that it would not receive future federal grants. Although experts on government contracts and grants scoffed at the missive, the government can essentially blacklist contractors through a process called debarment.\n\n\nAside from the research funding, there will be nothing to stop the administration from saddling the school with more onerous and potentially costly investigations, like the ones currently being conducted by at least five different departments and agencies, including the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Orders to Investigate Columbia Protesters Raised Alarms in Justice Dept.

I did so because the letter represents an authoritarian threat to science, and I knew it wasn’t an isolated, bizarre incident. It is a warning sign, another move in a broader campaign to exert control over research, medicine and media.\n\n\nThe letter asserts that “publications like CHEST Journal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates.” It was written by recently appointed acting U.S. attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr., who gives no examples that might demonstrate partisanship; nor does he cite any laws or legal principles to indicate a matter that should concern the U.S. government.\n\n\nSince I publicly shared this, at least four additional journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, have confirmed receipt of similar letters, according to MedPage Today, STAT News, the New York Times and Science. Aside from Eric Rubin at the NEJM, none of the targeted editors have been willing to go on record, fearing retribution from the Trump administration.\n\n\nWhy CHEST? It’s a specialty outlet—not even among the top 50 medical journals. Is this a keyword-driven campaign like those we’ve seen at the CDC and NIH? Under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., terms like “diversity,” “minority” and “equity” have been systematically flagged.\n\n\nKennedy frequently makes evidence-free claims on podcasts and television shows and now in government press conferences, regardless of the consequences. However, peer-reviewed journals like CHEST require extensive scrutiny as part of their evaluation process.\n\n\nHow a Decades-Old Diversity Program Became Collateral Damage in Trump’s Anti-DEI Crusade\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-a-decades-old-diversity-program-became-collateral-damage-in-trumps-anti-dei-crusade\n\nThe PhD Project has for three decades encouraged business professionals from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue doctorates in the discipline. For years, its work was seen as uncontroversial; its annual conference introduced midcareer business professionals of color to the academy, offering resources and a support network to those interested in switching jobs. Eventually, some of those prospective students would become professors themselves, helping diversify a traditionally homogenous discipline.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Congress Grills College Presidents With an Old Script and New Threats\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/congress-hearing-college-presidents-haverford.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUnder Republicans’ Scrutiny, College Presidents Apologize for Their Handling of Campus Antisemitism\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/under-republicans-scrutiny-college-presidents-apologize-for-their-handling-of-campus-antisemitism\n\nA three-hour-long hearing on Wednesday once again gave House Republicans the opportunity to amplify reports of antisemitic social-media posts, events, and confrontations, and to demand that institutions provide information on how they discipline students and faculty members who transgress.\n\n\nBut lawmakers seeking to make a point had material to work with. The three campuses all saw pro-Palestinian protests and alleged incidents of antisemitic harassment following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.\n\n\nWednesday’s hearing marked yet another expansion of Republicans’ efforts to put higher ed under pressure. Since January, the Trump administration has canceled or frozen grants at several prominent research universities, largely for alleged failures to combat antisemitism.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: On California’s State Bar Exam, More Questions Than Answers\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/california-state-bar-exam.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThen came the news that at least a handful of the multiple-choice questions had been developed with the help of artificial intelligence. To many of those who took the exam, it was hardly shocking — they already had suspicions that A.I. had been used, based on a few questions that they said had struck them as bizarrely worded or legally unsound.\n\n\nKaplan, the new contractor for exam development, disputed that the study guide contained a significant number of errors.\n\n\nthe State Bar of California said in a statement. “We apologize again, and we make no excuses for the failures that have occurred.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior State Department official sought internal communications with journalists, European officials, and Trump critics | MIT Technology Review\n\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/01/1115988/senior-state-department-official-sought-internal-communications-with-journalists-european-officials-and-trump-critics/\n\nFried echoes this sentiment. “I spent 40 years in the State Department, and you didn’t collect names or demand email records,” says Fried. “I’ve never heard of such a thing”—at least not in the American context, he clarifies. It did remind him of Eastern European “Communist Party minder[s] watching over the untrusted bureaucracy.”\n\n\nHe adds: “It also approaches the compilation of an enemies list.”\n\n\nCal Poly, DePaul and Haverford Head to Capitol Hill\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/executive-leadership/2025/05/07/cal-poly-depaul-and-haverford-head-capitol-hill\n\nThis time, lawmakers are targeting California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo; DePaul University; and Haverford College. Presidents from all three institutions will testify at a congressional hearing today.\n\n\nIn all three letters, the Republican-led Committee on Education and the Workforce cited alleged instances of antisemitism and noted failing grades on the Anti-Defamation League’s Campus Antisemitism Report Card: Both DePaul and Haverford received an F, while Cal Poly earned a D.\n\n(Put aside a committee that conflates a D with failing and perhaps worry that Hunter has a “C” grade and could be up soon by these standards.)\n\nHigher Education Leaders Call for Greater Defense of Board Independence\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/07/higher-ed-leaders-call-defense-board-independence\n(Reports on this letter https://agb.org/news/letters-and-testimony/community-letter-reaffirming-the-independence-of-higher-education-governance-a-call-to-action/)\n\nAmerican higher education leaders, advocates and stakeholders must stand together to “defend the autonomy of college and university governing boards as a cornerstone of constitutional freedoms; and reject political interference that undermines academic excellence and fiduciary stewardship,” the group said.\n\n\nThey also called for leaders to reaffirm the principles of institutional autonomy laid out in the 1819 Supreme Court decision Dartmouth College v. Woodward, which established safeguards to protect colleges from ideological and political interference.\n\n\nThe chairs of the boards of trustees at Clark Atlanta University, Eastern Michigan University and the University of Illinois are among the signatories, as well as the heads of the Middle States and New England Commissions of Higher Education.\n\n\nLawmakers in several states have introduced legislation that seeks to increase board oversight in processes like academic programming and tenure, as well as a governor’s ability to appoint board members.\n\n\nA Looming Crisis for Public Colleges: If the federal government cuts Medicaid spending, state funding for higher ed will evaporate.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-looming-crisis-for-public-colleges\n\nThe House Republicans’ plan for reconciliation includes a cut of about $880 billion over the next decade in health-care and energy spending and $230 billion from agriculture. A budget reduction of this magnitude will require significant reductions to Medicaid and SNAP.\n\n\nThat would directly harm low- and moderate-income Americans across the country, but these costs will also be passed on to states, putting pressure on already-tight budgets. And, as history has shown us time and time again, a state-budget squeeze almost always leads to skyrocketing college costs and lower-quality public education.\n\n\nMost states are required to pass balanced budgets each year. But some programs, like Medicaid, are directly tied to formulas and federal matching dollars. When revenue is tight, especially in tough economic times, states reduce the portion of their total budgets that remain “discretionary” — the portion that is not dictated by formula-derived expenses.  In almost every state, higher education is the largest discretionary-spending category.\n\n\nFor just one example, look to Pennsylvania, where I [Tanya I. Garcia] previously served as deputy secretary and commissioner for postsecondary and higher education. For the 30-year period from financial year 1991 to financial year 2021, Pennsylvania increased Medicaid spending by 227 percent and decreased higher-education spending by 28 percent.\n\n\nWhen state funding for higher education drops, it affects open-access, less-selective colleges the most, since they are more dependent on state appropriations and less able to raise their prices than their peers at elite public and flagship institutions. This is a crucial distinction, as 86 percent of all undergraduate students pursuing a degree in the United States do not attend selective flagships or research universities.\n\n\nMake no mistake: Such massive federal funding cuts would unleash mayhem on state budgets and public colleges starved for resources. Almost 40 states will have finalized their budgets by June 30 of this year. Will we have a raft of states calling special legislative sessions to revise their budgets when all is said and done in the nation’s capital? We still have time to avoid this.\n\n\nNYTimes: I Know Trump’s Plan for Universities. It Transformed My College.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/opinion/trump-universities-woke.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMr. Trump has been watching what’s transpired in Florida. The architect of Project 2025’s education policies has said that Florida is “leading the way” on university overhauls. Already, Mr. Trump has threatened to pull funding from colleges that don’t purge language he considers woke. He’s demanded new oversight of certain regional studies departments. Next he could try to ban, as Florida has, “political or social activism.” He could weaken the protections provided by tenure and faculty unions. I saw this happen on my campus, and I know the toll it took. If the Trump administration has its way, my experience could offer a preview of what’s coming for other universities.\n\n\nSince Mr. DeSantis’s crackdown, I’ve seen my colleagues harassed and investigated for addressing topical issues, even outside the classroom. The climate of fear gives the government precisely the result it wants. Administrators and faculty members alike practice anticipatory obedience to avoid even the appearance of wokeness, stifling the sort of open and civil discussions that lead students to develop their own views.\n\n\nSeveral professors have been subjected to efforts at entrapment. Last year a man posing as a student tried to encourage Muslim faculty members to criticize Mr. DeSantis and Israel. A similar incident happened to me. … That incident shattered my conviction that if I did my job well and followed the rules, I would be safe.\n\n\nTeaching is, above all, the creation of a community in the classroom, a web of trust and curiosity that binds students and instructors in a shared intellectual project. Mistrust, fear and self-censorship make that project impossible.\n\n\nNYTimes: West Point Is Supposed to Educate, Not Indoctrinate\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/opinion/west-point-trump-military.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Very good summary of how academic freedom is taken away overnight)\n\n\n\n\nChronicle of Higher Education\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda\nAlso this one on the “dismantling” of DEI\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-higher-eds-dismantling-of-dei\n\nWe Are Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.wearehighered.org/\n(This was mentioned in the NY Times article on the Rutgers “alliance” resolution and allows people to contribute, https://www.wearehighered.org/contact)\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

So, you can say that, in terms of the loss of freedom, most people feel unaffected. But what we need to get our fellow citizens to see is that it’s all connected, and that when due process is undermined even for a noncitizen, ultimately it can put everyone’s freedom in jeopardy. What lessons do you draw from other countries such as Hungary, India, Poland, Brazil, the Philippines, Turkey and Venezuela, all of which have seen democratic backsliding over the past few decades?\n\n\n The lessons are that people should unify and coordinate as quickly as possible. The more that institutions under threat try to just go their own way or duck for cover, the more they’ll be divided and picked off one by one.

Schools that fail to comply could be barred from spending state funds.\n\n\nOpponents say the result would essentially be a takeover of the state’s 126 public universities, community college districts and medical schools, with state officials even allowed to overturn hiring decisions. They fear it could damage the institutions’ reputations and lead to a faculty brain drain.\n\n\nHis (Brandon Creighton) new proposal aims to decrease the power of faculty senates, requiring that half of their members be appointed by school presidents. All would be term-limited, advisory only and removable by top administrators for “political advocacy.”\n\n\nAnother provision would give the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board — composed of nine gubernatorial appointees — the ultimate say in faculty and academic screening. The board would pay special attention to schools’ required core curriculum, to ensure they “do not require or attempt to require a student to adopt a belief that any race, sex, or ethnicity or social, political, or religious belief is inherently superior.”\n\n\nComplaints lodged against professors would be investigated by a new state ombudsman and the attorney general, currently Ken Paxton (R), an ultraconservative Trump ally.\n\n\n“Texas is as broad-reaching a legislative endeavor as we’ve seen,” he (Professor Peter Lake, Stetson University) said. And combined with Trump’s attacks on higher education, the legislation is likely to “embolden red states to experiment with even more control over institutional autonomy, right down to curriculum, hiring and firing, tenure, curriculum review.”\n\n\nUT System Chancellor James B.

That could be devastating for low-income students and the institutions that serve them.\n\n\nHe [sample impacted student] credits his success at Bemidji to TRIO, a federally funded initiative dating back to the 1960s that supports low-income, first-generation college students and students with disabilities as they navigate academic life—and that currently faces an existential threat from the Trump administration.\n\n\n“Today, the pendulum has swung and access to college is not the obstacle it was for students of limited means,” officials wrote in the proposal [Trump budget opening salvo]. “A renewed focus on academics and scholastic accomplishment by [institutions], rather than engaging in woke ideology with federal taxpayer subsidies, would be a welcome change.”\n\n\n\n\nACE’s summary of “STUDENT SUCCESS AND TAXPAYER SAVINGS PLAN” that moves to the House Budget Committee (thanks CMR)\n\nhttps://www.acenet.edu/Documents/Summary-Student-Success-Taxpayer-Savings-Plan.pdf\n(Yes, the name shows the crazy stretching of the all-too elastic phrase “student success”)\nIt includes: Pell Grant restrictions; Loan program eliminations; New repayment plan; Risk-sharing requirement; Regulatory constraints.\nKey parts for Pell\n\nChanges full-time status from 24 semester hours or 36 quarter credit hours to 30 semester hours or 45 quarter credit hours;\n\n(From 12 to 15 credits for CUNY making full time much more out of reach for many of our students)\n\nRequiring that a student who applies for federal student aid be a citizen or a national of the United States or be an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act; and\n\n\nThese provisions would take effect on July 1, 2025, and apply to the 2025-2026 academic year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Trump’s Proposed Budget Cuts Mean for Education, Research (aims to cut at least $163 billion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/05/02/trump-proposes-deep-cuts-education-and-research\n(I’d argue even phrasing this as a planned cut, rather than merely an assault is a mistake, but….)\n\nThe proposed budget plan slashes nearly $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health, $12 billion from the Education Department and nearly $5 billion from the National Science Foundation. The skinny budget also eliminates funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, AmeriCorps, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has already made deep cuts at those agencies and put most—if not all—of their employees on leave.\n\n\nTo compensate for the cuts to programs that directly support students or institutions, the administration argued colleges, states and local communities should on take that responsibility. Other justifications for the cuts reflect the administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and higher ed.\n\n(Again, “crackdown” is far too fair a term here.)\n\nAdditionally, the administration wants to cut the Office for Civil Rights’ budget by $49 million, or 35 percent. The budget document says this cut will refocus OCR “away from DEI and Title IX transgender cases.” In recent years, the Biden administration pleaded with Congress to boost OCR’s funding in order to address an increasing number of complaints. The office received 22,687 complaints in fiscal year 2024, and the Biden administration projected that number to grow to nearly 24,000 in 2025.\n\n\n“The budget cuts funding for: climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and programs in low priority areas of science,” the officials wrote in budget documents. “NSF has fueled research with dubious public value, like speculative impacts from extreme climate scenarios and niche social studies.”\n\n(There is too much there to even unpack; I’ll just note that this was preceded by “we must change course and reorient taxpayer dollars toward proven programs that generate results for American students.”)\n\nThe plan would consolidate NIH programs into five areas: the National Institute on Body Systems Research, the National Institute on Neuroscience and Brain Research, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Institute of Disability Related Research, and the National Institute on Behavioral Health.\n\n\n“The administration is committed to restoring accountability, public trust, and transparency at the NIH,” officials wrote. “NIH has broken the trust of the American people with wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.”\n\n(More nonsense in this “skinny budget”)\n\n\n\n\nUnder Trump, National Science Foundation Cuts Off All Funding to Scientists | Scientific American\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01396-2\n(Only until further notice, as if law breakers mean what they write)\n\nThe policy prevents the NSF, one of the world’s biggest supporters of basic research, from awarding new research grants and from supplying allotted funds for existing grants, such as those that receive yearly increments of money. The email does not provide a reason for the freeze and says that it will last “until further notice”.\n\n\nTrump Halts Grants, Caps Indirect Costs at the National Science Foundation\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-halts-grants-caps-indirect-costs-at-the-national-science-foundation\n\nUniversities Sue NSF Over Indirect Research Cost Policy\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/07/universities-sue-nsf-over-indirect-research-cost-policy\n\nPlaintiffs in the lawsuit include the American Council on Education, the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and 13 universities, including Arizona State University, the University of Chicago and Princeton University.\n\n\nThey attest that the NSF violated numerous aspects of the Administrative Procedure Act, including bypassing Congress to unilaterally institute an “arbitrary and capricious” 15 percent rate cap and failing to explain why it’s only imposing the policy on universities.\n\n\nThe NSF awarded $6.7 billion to some 621 universities in 2023.\n\n\nExclusive: NSF faces radical shake-up as officials abolish its 37 divisions | Science | AAAS\n\nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/exclusive-nsf-faces-radical-shake-officials-abolish-its-37-divisions\n\n[The NSF] is plunging into deeper turmoil. According to sources who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, staff were told today that the agency’s 37 divisions—across all eight NSF directorates—are being abolished and the number of programs within those divisions will be drastically reduced. The current directors and deputy directors will lose their titles and might be reassigned to other positions at the agency or elsewhere in the federal government.\n\n\nThe consolidation appears to be driven in part by President Donald Trump’s proposal to cut the agency’s $9 billion budget by 55% for the 2026 fiscal year that begins on 1 October.\n\n\nThe agency is also expected to issue another round of notices tomorrow terminating grants that have already been awarded, sources say. In the past 3 weeks, the agency has pulled the plug on almost 1400 grants worth more than $1 billion.\n\n(CSI faculty were among these who lost funding this week.)\n\n\n\n\nLawsuit Against Humanities Endowment Offers Details on DOGE - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/arts/humanities-endowment-doge-grants.html\n\nEmployees from the Department of Government Efficiency started visiting the office soon after, according to the lawsuit. Citing accounts by former or current staff members at the endowment, the lawsuit says that two DOGE employees, Nate Cavanaugh and Justin Fox, asked for a list of all current grants and then “indiscriminately terminated the vast majority” on April 2. Nearly 1,500 grant recipients received cancellation letters that suggested their projects were not in keeping with “the president’s agenda.”\n\n\nThree weeks later, the agency announced it would be redirecting [stealing ed.] $17 million of its funding to create the National Garden of American Heroes,\n\n\nThe lawsuit contends that those moves violate the Constitution, which reserves the power of the purse for Congress, and also the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\nTrump proposes eliminating the NEA and NEH as arts grants are canceled\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/05/03/trump-budget-nea-neh-eliminate/\n(This applies going forward, the lawsuit applies to past allocations. But the keyword is “proposed”, as this was just part of the Trumpian fantasy budget.)\n\nNYTimes: The National Endowment for the Arts Begins Terminating Grants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/arts/national-endowment-for-the-arts-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nGuidance from MAA (https://www.medievalacademy.org/; thanks EST for sharing)\n\n(This appeared in a news letter, so no link is available)\n\nWith the caveat that the MAA cannot offer actual legal advice, here is the current state of affairs, as we understand it:\n\n\n\nACLS, AHA, and MLA have filed a lawsuit against the NEH and DOGE. The complaint is online here. The suit is likely to proceed quickly, and we will keep you apprised of its progress.\n\n\n\n\nA court decision handed down earlier this week compels the government to restore terminated IMLS funding. I am hopeful that this success will serve as a strong precedent for other suits.\n\n\n\n\nThose who have lost NEH funding should have filed an appeal by now, either as an individual or through their host institution. If you have not done so, the guidance we’ve received is that you should file anyway before taking any further action, following whatever guidelines you have received (and with the understanding that there is, in fact, no truly clear guidance about what is happening at NEH). More information on the appeals process can be found here. When appealing any grant termination, be sure to emphasize how this loss may impact not only your research but your reputation, opportunities passed up to take on the grant-funded project, and the loss of future opportunities that the grant might have made possible. Please remember that our colleagues at NEH – those who remain – are devastated by the current situation and are themselves overwhelmed. They are committed Federal employees who are not to blame for these terminations. I urge you to try to be patient as your appeal (and the lawsuit) move forward.",

Now, investigating discrimination in schools is practically “impossible.”\n\n\nIn South Dakota, the OCR abruptly terminated its work with a school district that had agreed to take steps to end discrimination against its Native American students. The same office that helped craft the agreement to treat indigenous students equally made a stunning about-face and decided in March that helping Native American students would discriminate against white students.\n\n\nOne OCR attorney, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, told ProPublica that their caseload went from 60 to 380 as they absorbed cases previously handled by employees who worked in offices that had been closed.\n\n\n“OCR is the most useless it’s ever been, and it’s the most dangerous it’s ever been. And by useless, I mean unavailable. Unable to do the work,”\n\n\nInvestigating cases that allege racism, discrimination based on sexual orientation or mistreatment of students with disabilities now requires permission from Trump appointees, according to a memo from OCR leadership. As a result, thousands of discrimination investigations are idled, even ones that were nearing a resolution when Trump took office again.\n\n\nInvestigations being publicized now have largely bypassed the agency’s civil rights attorneys, according to Education Department employees. McMahon and OCR head Craig Trainor created what amounts to a shadow division.\n\n(This article is really a gut punch, but well worth reading)\n\nEducation Dept.

This year, prior to the cancellation, more than 400 applications had been submitted.",

So too must be the student body, staff and leadership. A failing grade, the letter warned, would result in corrective measures, including the deliberate recruiting of “a critical mass” of new faculty and students to correct the imbalance.\n\n\nHarvard has rejected the Trump administration’s demands, calling them a threat to academic freedom and the political independence of higher education. But in a letter to Harvard affiliates informing them that the university was suing the government, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, echoed that vocabulary.\n\n\n“We acknowledge that we have unfinished business,” Dr. Garber wrote. “We need to ensure that the university lives up to its steps to reaffirm a culture of free inquiry, viewpoint diversity and academic exploration.”\n\n\nHarvard itself has been a hotbed of diverse views about the value of viewpoint diversity and its relationship to the bedrock value of academic freedom. But there’s broad agreement that the Trump administration is weaponizing the term — which its letter never defines — in a dangerous way.\n\n\nThe term viewpoint diversity began gaining currency across academia largely through the efforts of Heterodox Academy, a nonpartisan national group founded in 2015 to combat what it describes as “the rise of closed-minded orthodoxies within scholarly communities.”\n\n\nIn recent years, it has been picked up by Republican politicians, as a new tool to support their longstanding argument that universities have been taken over by the left.\n\n\nA report last October by the free expression group PEN America said that viewpoint diversity, while a laudable goal, has too often served as “camouflage” for the real purpose: stifling faculty members’ speech.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Disqualifies Harvard From Future Research Grants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/trump-harvard-research-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThe letter is as they say meshuga\nhttps://x.com/EDSecMcMahon/status/1919517481313427594\nMy favorite is to now blame it on the math\n\nWhy is it, we ask, that Harvard has to teach simple and basic mathematics, when it is supposedly so hard to get into this “acclaimed university”? Who is getting in under such a low standard when others, with fabulous grades and a great understanding of the highest levels of mathematics, are being rejected?\n\nWhen the NY Times calls this “a contentious letter” they are only sane washing it. It might better be described by an AI prompt “write crazy letter on Harvard in the voice of the president, include all specious claims”\n\nDeciphering the Trump Administration’s Latest Letter to Harvard\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/05/07/experts-unpack-linda-mcmahons-latest-letter-harvard\nInsidehighered found one Project 2025 voice here:\n\n“When the secretary says, ‘Don’t come to us for grants anymore,’ she means that, and she can enforce it,” said Adam Kissel, a visiting fellow in the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Education Policy. “The tone suggests that Harvard really needs to wake up and understand the dire nature of its situation.”\n\nBut by and large, this is the take they find\n\nBut Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, described Monday’s letter as a “particularly disturbing” and “unwarranted escalation of threats.” What the Trump administration has done since day one, Pasquerella said, is launch a “politically motivated attack, not only against Harvard, but higher education as a whole,” and it’s all part of a long-standing Republican playbook.\n\n\nMultiple Inside Higher Ed sources have described the Trump administration’s approach to higher education as “fascist” or “authoritarian,” and Pasquerella even noted that the White House has positioned Viktor Orbán—Hungary’s right-wing prime minister who has long been known for his assault on academic freedom—as someone to emulate.\n\n\n“The president is so bombastic and so over-the-top that it’s hard for me to see gradations,” Hess [director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank] said. “So, sure, the secretary sending a letter that declared ‘don’t bother applying for anything’ is an extraordinary declaration. And in other circumstances, I would have been like, holy cow. But given what the administration has done over the past three and a half months, it’s not clear to me that it changes the administration’s posture.”\n\n\nTrump administration calls for a freeze on all new grants to Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/05/harvard-new-grants-freeze-trump/\n\nMcMahon’s letter displays an astonishing and frankly disqualifying level of ignorance — about Harvard, about how federal research funding works, and about the plain text of the U.S. Constitution,” Weld (AAUP President of Harvard chapter) said. “The entire higher ed sector must reject this crude authoritarianism with one voice.”\n\n\nTed Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, said, “I think we should all be looking at the interchange between the department, Harvard and the White House as harbingers of things to come.” \n\n\nLarry Summers, former president of Harvard, said the Trump administration’s fight with the Ivy League university has larger implications for civil society. “This is about whether the government has the power to coerce private institutions, using all the various authorities it has to advance particular political agendas of the president,” he said. “But for higher education, this is about academic freedom, which for the better part of a century, the Supreme Court recognized as intimately connected to the First Amendment. So in a broad civic sense, it’s about our commitment to constitutional democracy as manifest in the First Amendment.”\n\n\nTrump Finally Drops the Anti-Semitism Pretext – The latest letter to Harvard makes clear that the administration’s goal is to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal. (Thanks BE for the sharing and the gift link!)\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/mcmahon-harvard-letter/682717/?gift=yCYg0MdUGpnvquf3En3lpkKQKFBhGvbst4TkhNQ1SSk&utm_source=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=social\n(A critique that doesn’t sanewash and well worth reading)\n\nThe intensely hostile letter that Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent to the leadership of Harvard yesterday has a lot going on. But the most notable thing about it is what it leaves out.\n\n\nTo hear McMahon tell it, Harvard is a university on the verge of ruin. (I say McMahon because her signature is at the bottom of the letter, but portions of the document are written in such a distinctive idiolect—“Why is there so much HATE?” the letter asks; it signs off with “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”—that one detects the spirit of a certain uncredited co-author.)\n\n\nWhat you will not find in the McMahon letter is any mention of the original justification for the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on elite universities: anti-Semitism.\n\n\nNow, however, the mask is off. Aside from one oblique reference to congressional hearings about anti-Semitism (“the great work of Congresswoman Elise Stefanik”), the letter is silent on the subject. The administration is no longer pretending that it is standing up for Jewish students. The project has been revealed for what it is: an effort to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal.\n\n\n“There’s no ‘We don’t like you’ authority in the federal Constitution or in statutory law. In fact, quite the opposite: You’re precluded from that.” [Derek Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina]\n\n\nHarvard Faculty Pledge 10% of Their Salary to Defend Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/06/harvard-faculty-pledge-10-salary-defend-against-trump\n\nNearly 100 senior faculty members at Harvard have committed to taking a pay cut to support the institution’s legal defense against the federal government.\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Leaders See Only Bad Outcomes Ahead as They Battle Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/harvard-trump-court-case-negotiation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut behind the scenes, several senior officials at Harvard and on its top governing board believe that the university is confronting a crisis that could last until President Trump is out of power, according to three people involved in the discussions. Even if Harvard’s legal case is successful, these officials say, the school will still face enormous troubles that may force the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university to rethink its identity and scale.\n\nSo says\n\nThey spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss school officials’ private deliberations.\n\n\nThe crosscurrents are unlike any that the university has faced in its modern history. For centuries, Harvard has cherished its independence, its swaggering pride and its record of academic excellence. But Mr. Trump has reveled in unleashing chaos that many believe will be difficult to contain as long as he sees the university as a target.\n\n\nThe corporation [the board that oversees the university] has told the school’s lawyers not to engage with the Trump administration, according to the two people involved in discussions.\n\n\nComplicating matters is whether the White House will honor a deal.\n\n\nLawrence H. Summers, a former Harvard president, said … “It would be a tragedy if Harvard resolved this in a way that gave support and encouragement to the idea of extralegal extortion.”\n\n\nThe Trump administration this week reiterated its aim to inflict as much damage as possible, when Ms. McMahon fired off a letter telling Harvard that it would not receive future federal grants. Although experts on government contracts and grants scoffed at the missive, the government can essentially blacklist contractors through a process called debarment.\n\n\nAside from the research funding, there will be nothing to stop the administration from saddling the school with more onerous and potentially costly investigations, like the ones currently being conducted by at least five different departments and agencies, including the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Orders to Investigate Columbia Protesters Raised Alarms in Justice Dept.

    "text": "The Scary Implications of U.S. Government Attacks on Medical Journals | Scientific American\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-scary-implications-of-u-s-government-attacks-on-medical-journals/\n\nIn April, I decided to make public a leaked letter from the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to the editor-in-chief of CHEST, a leading pulmonology and critical care journal. I did so because the letter represents an authoritarian threat to science, and I knew it wasn’t an isolated, bizarre incident. It is a warning sign, another move in a broader campaign to exert control over research, medicine and media.\n\n\nThe letter asserts that “publications like CHEST Journal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates.” It was written by recently appointed acting U.S. attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr., who gives no examples that might demonstrate partisanship; nor does he cite any laws or legal principles to indicate a matter that should concern the U.S. government.\n\n\nSince I publicly shared this, at least four additional journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, have confirmed receipt of similar letters, according to MedPage Today, STAT News, the New York Times and Science. Aside from Eric Rubin at the NEJM, none of the targeted editors have been willing to go on record, fearing retribution from the Trump administration.\n\n\nWhy CHEST? It’s a specialty outlet—not even among the top 50 medical journals. Is this a keyword-driven campaign like those we’ve seen at the CDC and NIH? Under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., terms like “diversity,” “minority” and “equity” have been systematically flagged.\n\n\nKennedy frequently makes evidence-free claims on podcasts and television shows and now in government press conferences, regardless of the consequences. However, peer-reviewed journals like CHEST require extensive scrutiny as part of their evaluation process.\n\n\nHow a Decades-Old Diversity Program Became Collateral Damage in Trump’s Anti-DEI Crusade\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-a-decades-old-diversity-program-became-collateral-damage-in-trumps-anti-dei-crusade\n\nThe PhD Project has for three decades encouraged business professionals from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue doctorates in the discipline. For years, its work was seen as uncontroversial; its annual conference introduced midcareer business professionals of color to the academy, offering resources and a support network to those interested in switching jobs. Eventually, some of those prospective students would become professors themselves, helping diversify a traditionally homogenous discipline.",

The three campuses all saw pro-Palestinian protests and alleged incidents of antisemitic harassment following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.\n\n\nWednesday’s hearing marked yet another expansion of Republicans’ efforts to put higher ed under pressure. Since January, the Trump administration has canceled or frozen grants at several prominent research universities, largely for alleged failures to combat antisemitism.",

It did remind him of Eastern European “Communist Party minder[s] watching over the untrusted bureaucracy.”\n\n\nHe adds: “It also approaches the compilation of an enemies list.”\n\n\nCal Poly, DePaul and Haverford Head to Capitol Hill\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/executive-leadership/2025/05/07/cal-poly-depaul-and-haverford-head-capitol-hill\n\nThis time, lawmakers are targeting California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo; DePaul University; and Haverford College. Presidents from all three institutions will testify at a congressional hearing today.\n\n\nIn all three letters, the Republican-led Committee on Education and the Workforce cited alleged instances of antisemitism and noted failing grades on the Anti-Defamation League’s Campus Antisemitism Report Card: Both DePaul and Haverford received an F, while Cal Poly earned a D.\n\n(Put aside a committee that conflates a D with failing and perhaps worry that Hunter has a “C” grade and could be up soon by these standards.)\n\nHigher Education Leaders Call for Greater Defense of Board Independence\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/07/higher-ed-leaders-call-defense-board-independence\n(Reports on this letter https://agb.org/news/letters-and-testimony/community-letter-reaffirming-the-independence-of-higher-education-governance-a-call-to-action/)\n\nAmerican higher education leaders, advocates and stakeholders must stand together to “defend the autonomy of college and university governing boards as a cornerstone of constitutional freedoms; and reject political interference that undermines academic excellence and fiduciary stewardship,” the group said.\n\n\nThey also called for leaders to reaffirm the principles of institutional autonomy laid out in the 1819 Supreme Court decision Dartmouth College v. Woodward, which established safeguards to protect colleges from ideological and political interference.\n\n\nThe chairs of the boards of trustees at Clark Atlanta University, Eastern Michigan University and the University of Illinois are among the signatories, as well as the heads of the Middle States and New England Commissions of Higher Education.\n\n\nLawmakers in several states have introduced legislation that seeks to increase board oversight in processes like academic programming and tenure, as well as a governor’s ability to appoint board members.\n\n\nA Looming Crisis for Public Colleges: If the federal government cuts Medicaid spending, state funding for higher ed will evaporate.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-looming-crisis-for-public-colleges\n\nThe House Republicans’ plan for reconciliation includes a cut of about $880 billion over the next decade in health-care and energy spending and $230 billion from agriculture. A budget reduction of this magnitude will require significant reductions to Medicaid and SNAP.\n\n\nThat would directly harm low- and moderate-income Americans across the country, but these costs will also be passed on to states, putting pressure on already-tight budgets. And, as history has shown us time and time again, a state-budget squeeze almost always leads to skyrocketing college costs and lower-quality public education.\n\n\nMost states are required to pass balanced budgets each year. But some programs, like Medicaid, are directly tied to formulas and federal matching dollars. When revenue is tight, especially in tough economic times, states reduce the portion of their total budgets that remain “discretionary” — the portion that is not dictated by formula-derived expenses.  In almost every state, higher education is the largest discretionary-spending category.\n\n\nFor just one example, look to Pennsylvania, where I [Tanya I. Garcia] previously served as deputy secretary and commissioner for postsecondary and higher education. For the 30-year period from financial year 1991 to financial year 2021, Pennsylvania increased Medicaid spending by 227 percent and decreased higher-education spending by 28 percent.\n\n\nWhen state funding for higher education drops, it affects open-access, less-selective colleges the most, since they are more dependent on state appropriations and less able to raise their prices than their peers at elite public and flagship institutions. This is a crucial distinction, as 86 percent of all undergraduate students pursuing a degree in the United States do not attend selective flagships or research universities.\n\n\nMake no mistake: Such massive federal funding cuts would unleash mayhem on state budgets and public colleges starved for resources. Almost 40 states will have finalized their budgets by June 30 of this year. Will we have a raft of states calling special legislative sessions to revise their budgets when all is said and done in the nation’s capital? We still have time to avoid this.\n\n\nNYTimes: I Know Trump’s Plan for Universities. It Transformed My College.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/opinion/trump-universities-woke.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMr. Trump has been watching what’s transpired in Florida. The architect of Project 2025’s education policies has said that Florida is “leading the way” on university overhauls. Already, Mr. Trump has threatened to pull funding from colleges that don’t purge language he considers woke. He’s demanded new oversight of certain regional studies departments. Next he could try to ban, as Florida has, “political or social activism.” He could weaken the protections provided by tenure and faculty unions. I saw this happen on my campus, and I know the toll it took. If the Trump administration has its way, my experience could offer a preview of what’s coming for other universities.\n\n\nSince Mr. DeSantis’s crackdown, I’ve seen my colleagues harassed and investigated for addressing topical issues, even outside the classroom. The climate of fear gives the government precisely the result it wants. Administrators and faculty members alike practice anticipatory obedience to avoid even the appearance of wokeness, stifling the sort of open and civil discussions that lead students to develop their own views.\n\n\nSeveral professors have been subjected to efforts at entrapment. Last year a man posing as a student tried to encourage Muslim faculty members to criticize Mr. DeSantis and Israel. A similar incident happened to me. … That incident shattered my conviction that if I did my job well and followed the rules, I would be safe.\n\n\nTeaching is, above all, the creation of a community in the classroom, a web of trust and curiosity that binds students and instructors in a shared intellectual project. Mistrust, fear and self-censorship make that project impossible.\n\n\nNYTimes: West Point Is Supposed to Educate, Not Indoctrinate\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/opinion/west-point-trump-military.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Very good summary of how academic freedom is taken away overnight)",

    "text": "Dear All,\nPlease find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.\n(Thanks to K, VAC for sharing stories this week.)\nThe aftermath of a murder has reached farther faster than could have been imagined. This week the Freedom of expression category is far to full of items.\n\n\n\nThoughts on Education and Freedom as Fall Begins (opinion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/09/12/thoughts-education-and-freedom-fall-begins-opinion\n\nAs a Jewish teacher and university president, it pains me to see the fight against antisemitism used as a cudgel with which to attack centers of teaching and research. I’ve been very aware of antisemitism since I was a little boy,…I am genuinely startled, though, by the ways Christian nationalists in the American government use Jew hatred as a vehicle to advance their authoritarian agenda. That’s what we are witnessing today: the exploitation of anti-antisemitism by a White House determined to extort money and expressions of loyalty from higher education.\n\n\nThis environment is threatened by the enormous pressure the federal government is putting on higher education to “align its priorities” with those of the president. I am worried about the normalization of this authoritarian effort to reshape the ecosystem of higher education. Too many opportunists and collaborators have been responding by noisily preaching neutrality or just keeping their heads down.\n\n\nSome faculty, student and alumni groups, however, have begun to stand up and make their voices heard. Whether refusing to apologize for diversity efforts or simply standing up for the freedom of scientific inquiry, there is growing resistance to the administration’s attempt to control civil society in general and higher education in particular.\n\n\nWe don’t want the government thinking for us, telling us what the president’s priorities are so that we can imitate them. We want to learn to think for ourselves in the company of others, leaving behind a dependence on authority. Authoritarians would see us impose immaturity upon ourselves. As the new school year begins, we in higher education must redouble our efforts to model and defend the enlightenment ideals of education and freedom—while we still can.\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff Members Fired, Grad Student Punished for Cheering Charlie Kirk’s Death\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/12/staff-members-fired-grad-student-punished-cheering-charlie-kirks-death\n\nLate Wednesday, a student affairs administrator at Middle Tennessee State University was fired after posting “insensitive” remarks on Facebook in response to Kirk’s death.\n\n\n“Looks like ol’ Charlie spoke his fate into existence. Hate begets hate. ZERO sympathy,” Sosh-Lightsy wrote in a Facebook post … Tennessee senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, called for Sosh-Lightsy’s firing on X,\n\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, University of Mississippi chancellor Glenn Boyce confirmed the firing of an unnamed staff member who he said “re-shared hurtful, insensitive comments on social media regarding the tragic murder of Charlie Kirk.”\n\n\nAt Baylor University, officials distanced the university from a graduate student who wrote “this made me giggle” in response to a social media post sharing the news of Kirk’s death.\n\n\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression is monitoring which universities are censoring employee speech, said Lindsie Rank, director of campus rights advocacy at FIRE. “It may not be moral to speak ill of the dead, but it is protected by the First Amendment so we’re going to be keeping our eyes open for those situations,” she said.\n\n\n6 More Faculty, Staff Removed for Kirk Comments\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/09/12/6-more-faculty-staff-removed-kirk-comments\n\nRepublican politicians and other conservatives are calling for employees, including those in higher ed, to be terminated for their social media posts about Kirk’s killing.\n\n\nAt least eight faculty and staff members have been fired or suspended so far for comments they made\n\n\nWorkers are getting fired, placed on leave over Charlie Kirk posts\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/12/workers-fired-charlie-kirk-reaction-online/\n\nNYTimes: Right-Wing Activists Urge Followers to Expose Those Celebrating Kirk Killing\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/us/politics/charlie-kirk-shooting-firings-celebration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nand at least one Trump administration official have actively encouraged people to scour the internet for remarks celebrating the killing and to expose those who have posted them online.\n\n\nChristopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, issued a separate call on Thursday morning, asking his more than 200,000 followers on X to reach out to him with information about “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred.”\n\n\nA Secret Service employee was placed on administrative leave after stating on Facebook that Mr. Kirk had “spewed hate and racism on his show,”\n\n\nAfter Michael Mann, a prominent climate scientist who works at the University of Pennsylvania, reposted a message referring to Mr. Kirk as the “head of Trump’s Hitler Youth,” Dave McCormick, the state’s Republican senator, called it “despicable” and urged the university to “take immediate, decisive action.”\n\n\nRose Pugliese, a Colorado state lawmaker who is a Republican, asked Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, on Thursday to fire a state employee who had accused Mr. Kirk online of being “a white man who spews horrid” words “against every marginalized community.”\n\n\nRepresentative Clay Higgins, Republican of Louisiana, said that he planned to use “Congressional authority” to force tech companies to “ban for life” any person who “belittled the assassination of Charlie Kirk.”\n\n\nJohn C. Phelan, the secretary of the Navy, posted a message saying that sailors or Marines found to be “displaying contempt toward a fellow American who was assassinated” would be “dealt with swiftly and decisively.”\n\n\nTim Weninger, a professor at the University of Notre Dame who studies the ways social media is used to dehumanize people and incite violence, described the targeting campaign as a new front in online rhetoric. “I haven’t seen something like this on social media in America, really ever — it’s a unique moment,” he said.\n\n\nAnastasios Kamoutsas, the commissioner of education in Florida, said in a memo to state superintendents on Thursday that some teachers had made “despicable comments” about Mr. Kirk’s killing and that he intended to investigate every teacher who posted vile, inappropriate messages.\n\n(Also)\n\nRight-Wing Activists Are Targeting People for Allegedly Celebrating Charlie Kirk’s Death\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/right-wing-activists-are-targeting-people-for-allegedly-celebrating-charlie-kirks-death/?_sp=1522a619-e680-429d-9e8c-504e29747171.1757700164905\n\nMAGA’s Doxing War Over Charlie Kirk Is Already Going Off the Rails | The New Republic\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/post/200472/maga-doxxing-charlie-kirk-going-off-rails?utm_campaign=SF_TNR&utm_medium=social&utm_source=Bluesky\n\nAli Nasrati, 30, said he hadn’t posted anything about Kirk but was still publicly doxed over an account using his name and photograph that made posts mocking the right-wing activist,\n\n\nOther instances of doxing appear to have been prompted by unverified information. Ryan Fournier, the national chair of Students for Trump, was forced to walk back accusations of anti-Kirk comments against an elementary school teacher in Wisconsin. “\n\n\nOn Sunday night, an anonymous website collecting reports of anti-Kirk “political extremism” said it had received more than 63,000 submissions.\n\n\nDoxing Campaign Endangers Faculty and Free Speech\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/09/19/right-wing-doxing-campaign-endangers-faculty-and\n\nThe force and scale of the doxing campaigns—and the speed with which institutions have moved to suspend or terminate their targets—paints a grim picture of free speech rights on public college campuses. Widespread doxing as a political tool to punish universities and academics is not a new phenomenon, but right now it’s particularly virulent, explained Keith Whittington, a professor at Yale Law School and an expert on free speech. “The size of the activity, the pressure campaign and the … short period of time is highly unusual,” he said. “Universities feel like they’re under intense pressure to mollify right-wing activists and try not to draw negative attention from the [Trump] administration.”\n\n(This is happening at CUNY)\n\nTexas State professor fired for comments at socialism meeting | The Texas Tribune\n\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2025/09/10/texas-state-university-professor-fired/\n(Also)\n\nA Tenured Professor Spoke Hypothetically About Overthrowing the Government. He Was Fired 3 Days Later.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-tenured-professor-spoke-hypothetically-about-overthrowing-the-government-he-was-fired-3-days-later\n\nA Texas State University professor was fired days after he made remarks the institution’s president described as advocating for “inciting violence,” becoming the second faculty member in the state this week to be swiftly terminated following the release of a viral video.\n\n\nBut experts say there’s an important distinction between the two cases: The Texas State faculty member was an associate professor with tenure, which typically grants several layers of due process before termination, while a Texas A&M senior lecturer who was terminated earlier this week didn’t have the same protections. Two people with knowledge of the situation confirmed to The Chronicle that the Texas State professor had earned tenure at the start of this academic year.\n\n\nThe Texas State Employees Union, of which Alter is a member, said that he was fired “without a hearing or any meaningful opportunity to respond,” and that he only found out about his termination when Damphousse publicly announced it.\n\n\nThe speed of Alter’s termination was legally dubious, higher-ed legal experts told The Chronicle, and violated the principles of academic freedom. While there have been many examples in the past dozen years of social-media campaigns calling for professors to be disciplined or even fired over their speech, Texas State’s near-instant decision to dismiss a tenured professor is rare, said Samantha Harris, a lawyer who defends college professors in disciplinary proceedings.\n\n\n“What Texas State is doing seems to me to be so obviously unlawful — and so likely to lead to a successful lawsuit — that they must be more afraid of something else, like running afoul of the political priorities of state or federal officials,” Harris said.\n\n\nUniversity of Tennessee looks to terminate faculty member over social media post | wbir.com\n\nhttps://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/downtown-ut/ut-employee-charlie-kirk-investigation/51-2b6e9ad8-d0f8-4114-899d-dfccfd4db044\n\nThe University of Tennessee announced it placed one of its faculty members on administrative leave and is beginning termination proceedings against her after Tennessee lawmakers began looking into a social media post claiming she celebrated Charlie Kirk’s assassination on social media.\n\n\nClemson U. Touted Free Speech After 3 Employees Posted About Charlie Kirk. Then It Reversed Course.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/clemson-u-touted-free-speech-after-3-employees-posted-about-charlie-kirk-then-it-reversed-course\n(Ditto)\n\nEmployees and Students at These Colleges Have Been Punished for Comments on Charlie Kirk’s Death\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/employees-and-students-at-these-colleges-have-been-punished-for-comments-on-charlie-kirks-death\n\nA pattern has emerged: The college employee or student says something negative about Kirk — mostly online, but occasionally in class or on campus. State and congressional lawmakers and right-wing social-media accounts amplify the comments and advocate for the colleges to take disciplinary action. Some lawmakers have threatened to pull funding or enact other consequences if the colleges don’t fire the employees.\n\n(Map of 24 faculty, 13 staff, 3 students; see appendix)\n\nOpinion | The Assassination That Broke Campus Free Speech\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-assassination-that-broke-campus-free-speech\n\nThis was already a theme before Kirk’s murder. Texas A&M University fired a lecturer seemingly at the behest of the governor after politicians objected to the content of her children’s-literature class. Texas State University fired a history professor for his personal advocacy of the organization of a revolutionary socialist party that would aid the working class to “overthrow” the United States government.\n\n\nBut the pressure to patrol speech on college campuses has since reached new intensity. An assistant dean in the Office of Student Care and Conduct at Middle Tennessee State University was fired for a “callous and insensitive” social-media post after Kirk’s death. An English professor at Cumberland University was fired after a U.S. senator called attention to his posts about “a Nazi getting shot.” An art professor at the University of South Dakota was fired after calling Kirk a “hate-spreading Nazi” after his murder. A College of the Sequoias biology professor is under investigation for allegedly telling his class that he hoped Kirk’s whole family would meet the same fate. A Guilford Technical Community College English instructor was fired for praising the assassin to her class. An audio-technology professor at Clemson University has been suspended for mocking Kirk’s death in social-media posts.\n\n\nPublic colleges are legally constrained by the First Amendment in how they can respond to demands to punish students and employees for hateful, morally depraved, or politically incendiary speech. Private colleges have more flexibility, though many have voluntarily tied themselves to First Amendment norms through their own policies. Everyone on campus, including senior university officials, should understand what speech is — and is not — protected under such rules.\n\n\nGiven the misinformation about First Amendment rules routinely spread in public discourse — including by university officials — it is worth clarifying that in the United States, constitutional protections for speech are expansive, a fact not always reflected in the official statements from colleges. Texas State University suggested that speech that “advocates for inciting violence” is unprotected. Clemson claimed that the right to free speech does not extend to expression that “incites harm or undermines the dignity of others.” The chairman of the board at Southern University implied that “distasteful statements” about death are “tantamount to participating and inciting violence and spewing hate,” and thus unprotected. None of this is really true.\n\n\nNYTimes: The Kirk Crackdown Is Underway\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/opinion/trump-charlie-kirk-crackdown.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nPresident Trump and his allies are capitalizing on the assassination of Charlie Kirk to open up fresh attacks on liberal institutions, donors and foundations. They seek to portray many on the left as traitors.\n\n\nTrump and his allies have long exploited “emergencies” to push divisive measures. Now he claims that left-wing terrorism is a greater threat than terror perpetrated by the right, a demonstrably false assertion.\n\n\nTrump and his MAGA followers have not just turned Kirk’s murder into a political weapon; they are trying, with some success, to use it to build a national movement to publicly out everyone who criticized Kirk on social media after his death. They are also trying to persuade employers to fire Kirk’s critics.\n\n\nTrump and Miller have claimed that the Ford Foundation and George Soros’s Open Society Foundations are financing violence on the left.\n\n\nThe political right in the United States has long tried to argue that the political left is responsible for more violence than the political right. That simply hasn’t been true for decades. Lots of folks have surfaced a lot of evidence to illustrate that the far right has been responsible for more violence in the U.S. than the far left, including violent deaths. [Sam Jackson, a professor of emergency management and homeland security at SUNY-Albany]\n\n\nViolent far-right extremist have been responsible for 94 of the 108 terrorism fatalities (87 percent) in the United States in the past five years. This included 2022, when 18 of the 19 fatalities occurred during far-right terrorist attacks.\n\n\nOf the 71 terrorist attacks in 2022, 69 percent were perpetrated by those on the violent far right, 20 percent by the violent far left, 3 percent by Salafi-jihadists and 8 percent by ethnonationalists.

Today the word we hear is “complicity.” What all of these words are meant to suggest is that regimes of fear are never simply top-down affairs. They have a strong bottom-up component as well.\n\n\nUnfortunately, in our discourse today, including on the Left, that bottom-up element is often construed to be a mob of racist randos on social media or rubes in the red states. But that’s a comfort and a conceit. The truth is that collaborators are particular agents, trusted with discrete responsibility and concrete power at various levels, in multiple institutions, making choices, sometimes for the best of reasons, with consequences that they may not intend but that are likely to result anyway.\n\n\nKirk’s Slaying Prompts College Leaders to Speak Out\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/09/17/kirks-slaying-prompts-college-leaders-speak-out\n\nUniversities are making exceptions to institutional neutrality policies to issue statements on Charlie Kirk’s death as some take aggressive action against some faculty remarks.\n\n\nMultiple universities adopted institutional neutrality policies amid the fallout [of the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks], essentially agreeing to refrain from making statements on political matters and to show more restraint, generally, on issuing statements on current events.\n\n\nThe University of Wyoming adopted institutional neutrality in late 2023.\n\n\nBut last week, President Ed Seidel released a statement “expressing disgust, outrage and sadness at this apparent politically motivated attack”\n\n\nAlthough Middlebury does not have an institutional neutrality policy and Baucom [Middlebury President] emphasized he was speaking in his personal capacity, he said that he takes “broad guidance from the University of Chicago’s Kalven principles,” which essentially serve as the bedrock for such policies. But he also noted that the Kalven Report concluded that universities will need to defend their interests and values when “instances will arise” that threaten institutional missions and free inquiry.\n\n\nWhile Greenberg [Lawyer at FIRE] said Clemson’s statement [““We stand firmly on the principles of the U.S. Constitution, including the protection of free speech,..However, that right does not extend to speech that incites harm or undermines the dignity of others.”] was rare, colleges punishing employees for their speech is not.

But Texas governor Greg Abbott has taken the campaign to another level: going after individual students.\n\n\nAbbott, who has more than 1.4 million followers on X, used that social media website to call for Texas State University to expel a student who appeared to mime Kirk’s shooting at a vigil for Kirk. Shortly after, university president Kelly Damphousse announced that a student in a “disturbing” video “is no longer a student at TXST.”\n\n\nIn another post on X, Abbott applauded Texas Tech University for allegedly expelling and arresting a student.

The down-the-road cancellation of Stephen Colbert’s late-night show on CBS was chalked up to financial concerns, though anyone in the business not paid to think otherwise believes Mr. Colbert’s elegant skewerings of President Trump and MAGA were the real reason.\n\n\nThe silencing of Mr. Kimmel, following an explicit threat by Brendan Carr, the head of ABC’s regulator, the Federal Communications Commission, is the mask of “free speech” coming off for good.\n\n\nThe complaint about so-called big media, historically, was that it was too commercial.

The department offered an answer Monday, announcing plans to repurpose funds from programs “not in the best interest of students and families” to historically Black colleges and universities, tribal colleges, charter schools, and civics education.\n\n(At CUNY some 35 projects impacted by the new DOE directive and the future funding of those projects is $14.1 million; the amount seriously at risk.)\n\n\n\nNIH Now On Track to Spend Its Full Budget by Sept. 30\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/15/nih-now-track-spend-its-full-budget-sept-30\n\nThe National Institutes of Health now appears on track to spend its full $47 billion budget by Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year, STAT News reported Friday. That reflects “a frenzy of grantmaking activity during August,” worth more than $8 billion, STAT noted; the agency was far behind on awarding grants going into the summer, due to delays in the grant review process, the fight over the cap on indirect cost rates and widespread layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\nHowever, STAT’s analysis showed that while the value of the grants awarded is roughly the same, the NIH is funding many fewer new projects this year than in the past. That’s because earlier this year the White House Office of Management and Budget mandated a shift in the way the agency distributes research dollars to a multiyear model, meaning that at least half of all new projects will be funded up front for multiple years rather than receive a new tranche of funding each year.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Shutting Down the War On Cancer\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/14/magazine/cancer-research-grants-funds-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Damning story showing the effects of political malfeasance at the NIH)\n\nWhen America declared war on cancer more than 50 years ago, there was a misguided assumption outside the scientific community that it would be only a matter of years before the disease was eradicated — that defeating cancer would be no different than building an atomic bomb or putting a man on the moon. But there would be no miracle cure: As of this writing, some 40 percent of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their life.\n\n\nAccording to a recent study in The Journal of Clinical Oncology, every $326 that our government spends researching cancer extends a human life by one year. Now an extraordinarily successful scientific research system — one that took decades to build, has saved millions of lives and generated billions of dollars in profits for American companies and investors — is being dismantled before our eyes.\n\n\nIn a matter of months, the Trump administration has canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in cancer-related research grants and contracts, arguing that they were part of politically driven D.E.I. initiatives, and suspended or delayed payments for hundreds of millions more. It is trying to sharply reduce the percentage of expenses that the government will cover for federally funded cancer-research labs. It has terminated hundreds of government employees who helped lead the country’s cancer-research system and ensured that new discoveries reached clinicians, cancer patients and the American public. And the president’s proposed budget for the next fiscal year calls for a more-than-37-percent cut to the National Cancer Institute — the N.I.H. agency that leads most of the nation’s cancer research — reducing it to $4.5 billion from $7.2 billion. Adjusting for inflation, you have to go back more than 30 years to find a comparably sized federal cancer-research budget.\n\n\nIn the absence of any such plan [neither he nor anyone inside his administration has spoken explicitly about its intention to radically rethink how America funds and directs cancer research], it’s hard not to see the ongoing dismantling of the cancer research system as collateral damage in a larger, partisan war against both the predominantly Democratic scientific establishment and the predominantly Democratic academic institutions where much of the country’s biomedical research takes place. And yet the term “collateral damage” suggests a lack of agency; this has been a deliberate and targeted attack. “They have studied how N.I.H. works, studied it hard and learned it well,” says Sarah Kobrin, head of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch at the National Cancer Institute. “And they have put sand in the gears in ways that are very effective, devastating.”\n\n\nNYTimes: California’s $23 Billion Plan to Restore Federal Cuts to Scientific Research\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/california-scientific-research-bond.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nSupporters of the proposal said it would effectively create a state version of the National Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation, two of the nation’s largest institutional funders of scientific and public health research. The move follows California, Washington and Oregon’s announcement that they would form a health alliance to review scientific data and make vaccine recommendations for their residents, in an attempt to bypass vaccine skeptics in the Trump administration.\n\n\nThe plan to back scientific research calls for lawmakers to pass, and for voters to approve in a 2026 ballot measure, a proposed $23 billion in bonds, financing that will allow the state to make grants and loans to universities, research companies and health care organizations.\n\n\nIt would be the largest state effort of its kind, and is considerably more aggressive than one floated in Massachusetts in July, when Gov. Maura Healey made a $400 million proposal for research there.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEH grant to fight antisemitism is largest ever, signaling Trump-era shift\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/09/16/neh-grant-tikvah-jewish-civilization-project/\n\nThe grant was not part of a competition, and Tikvah was invited to apply, according to two people with direct knowledge of the grantmaking process\n\n\nTikvah is a New York-based think tank and nonprofit that describes its mission as advancing “Jewish excellence and Western civilization through education and ideas.” The group has been associated with conservative U.S. politics.

Nonetheless, they got caught in the Trump administration’s attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion, with an Education Department spokesperson citing concerns about “divisive concepts” and “fairness” in acknowledging the decision to withhold the funding.\n\n\n“I was told that apparently the administration is going through past grants and two words were flagged: One was transition and one was privilege,” Klenz said. “Transition — transitioning from childhood to adulthood.

But just 20 percent agree that recent federal interventions into campus climates, such as those seen at Harvard and Columbia University—which are unprecedented in scope and speed, and have resulted in the suspension of billions of dollars in unrelated research funding—may be justified.\n\n\nNadell [ Patrick Clendenen Chair in Women’s and Gender History at American University and author of the new book Antisemitism, an American Tradition] continued, “It’s also really important to understand that the leadership of the Republican Party had, well before Oct. 7, been planning an attack on the university.” And there’s “no question, as I see it, that antisemitism has become instrumentalized to do something that the administration and the current leadership has long wanted to achieve.”\n\n\n“This administration is hiding the ball, making it even more combative and more difficult,” Gellman-Beer [a civil rights compliance consultant who handled all manner of shared ancestry complaints under Republican and Democratic administrations through the Office for Civil Rights’ Philadelphia branch] said. “The administration is changing the legal standard with every new letter that comes out.

The education department has been targeting colleges across the country as part of Donald Trump’s aggressive crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism, international students and academic freedom.\n\n\nJudith Butler, a prominent feminist philosopher and queer theorist, received the letter from David Robinson, UC Berkeley’s chief campus counsel, which said OCR was investigating “allegations of antisemitic harassment and discrimination” and “required production of comprehensive documents”.\n\n\nButler, a Jewish scholar who has been critical of Israel, said on Friday that they had questioned Robinson about the disclosures and said he provided no information on the specific allegations.\n\n\n“We have a right to know the charges against us, to know who has made the charges and to review them and defend ourselves,” they said. “But none of that has happened, which is why we’re in Kafka-land … It is an enormous breach of trust.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/politics/trump-berkeley-antisemitism-investigation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/uc-berkeley-hands-over-160-names-to-the-federal-government-for-potential-connection-to-antisemitism\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: University of California Leaders to Meet as Trump Increases Pressure\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/17/us/university-of-california-berkeley-regents-meeting.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUniversity of California leaders, besieged by a billion-dollar demand from the Trump administration, will meet Wednesday as they weigh how to confront Washington’s campaign to remake American campuses.\n\n\nThe consequences of that effort have become increasingly vivid inside the university, which has been contending with an uproar over its decision last month to comply with federal investigators’ request for information. The university gave the Department of Education the names of scores of students and employees connected to allegations of antisemitism, a move that infuriated people throughout the 10-campus system after word of it emerged this month.\n\n\nThe disclosure deepened the sense of turmoil inside U.C., which is facing an escalating effort from the Trump administration to force changes to one of the nation’s largest and most distinguished university systems. The full Board of Regents has not met in public since mid-July, and the Trump administration’s tactics have gathered far greater force since then.\n\n\nFor example, the government demanded last month that the university pay about $1.2 billion to settle accusations of antisemitism at its Los Angeles campus, and it has pressured administrators there to accept conditions that include steps to ensure “that foreign students likely to engage in anti-Western, anti-American or antisemitic disruptions or harassment are not recruited or admitted.”\n\n\nAhead of Wednesday’s regents’ meeting in San Francisco, Mr. Milliken acknowledged in a statement that threats to the system could metastasize and warned that the federal authorities were “pursuing investigations and actions in various stages against all 10 U.C. campuses.”\n\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the system’s general counsel, Charles F. Robinson, argued that the university had only followed its regular practice of responding to “information requests arising from audits, compliance reviews and investigations.” Mr. Robinson said the university had also made sure to comply with “applicable privacy laws.”\n\n\n“U.C. will continue to meet its legal obligations,” he added, “while exploring all legal avenues to safeguard the privacy and trust of our community members.”\n\n\nBut the litigation from the workers’ groups nevertheless underscored the measured approach that U.C. has adopted so far. Some inside the university are wary of taking steps that could further rile the Trump administration, which has repeatedly cut federal funding to universities to try to bring them to heel.\n\n\nLike other major American universities, U.C. relies on vast sums of federal funding to operate. More than $7 billion goes to research and federal student aid, Mr. Milliken noted this week, while roughly $10 billion more flows from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. (U.C. has six academic medical centers.)\n\n\nGroups sue administration over funding freeze at University of California\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/09/16/groups-sue-administration-over-funding-freeze-university-california/\n\nThe complaint was filed Tuesday in federal district court by the American Association of University Professors, Democracy Forward, and numerous other labor unions and organizations that represent tens of thousands of faculty members, students and staff members across the large public university system.\n\n\nThe lawsuit details numerous demands, also reported Monday by the Los Angeles Times, made by the Trump administration of UCLA. They include eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs; ceding control over university admissions, hiring and curriculum to an outside monitor; reporting student disciplinary records; and other measures.\n\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to exert ideological control over higher education, the lawsuit contends, “through a scheme of targeting, bullying and unconstitutional actions aimed at institutions of higher education across the country.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/17/california-unions-sue-trump-admin-over-threats-uc-system\n\n\n\n\nTexas A&M president resigns after instructor’s firing over gender teachings\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/09/18/texasam-president-resign-mark-welsh-gender/\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nWelsh took over at Texas A&M two years ago after M. Katherine Banks retired as university president in the wake of a scandal involving the botched hiring of journalism professor Kathleen McElroy. That job offer provoked backlash from the Texas GOP because of McElroy’s work on diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which Texas has since banned.\n\n\n“Today, President Welsh has submitted his resignation, and both the Board of Regents and I agree that this is the right moment for change,” Texas A&M Chancellor Glenn Hegar said\n\n\n“It was the right decision for him to do for himself, the university, students, and faculty,” said Leonard Bright, a professor at Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, in a text message. “Now, we look to the university and (board of regents) to conduct an earnest search for a replacement who will fully support the values of academic freedom and protect the university from political interference in our classrooms.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/executive-leadership/2025/09/18/texas-am-president-steps-down-under-pressure\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/us/texas-am-president-gender-ideology-controversy.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe case also raised serious questions about academic freedom at Texas A&M and prompted pushback from faculty members who argued that McCoul’s termination was unnecessary and unjust.

They’re about to get worse.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/charlie-kirks-death-is-a-catastrophe-for-higher-ed\n\nColleges and universities have been under pressure by Kirk and his political allies for years. Turning Point USA launched its Professor Watchlist in 2016 to intimidate professors whom the organizations claims “discriminate against conservative students, promote anti-American values, and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.” (Full disclosure: I am on the Professor Watchlist myself, apparently on the basis of my scholarship on the conservative movement and the far right and teaching a class on fascism and antifascism.)\n\n\nBut TPUSA’s attacks on academic freedom have paled in comparison to the Trump administration’s assaults on higher education through funding freezes for basic scientific research, legal attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and the targeting of dozens of universities by the Department of Justice for transparently political reasons. At the University of Virginia, my home institution, DOJ pressure was instrumental in prompting the resignation of the university’s president, Jim Ryan, at the end of June.\n\n\nIt is practically inevitable that there will be dire policy consequences from Kirk’s assassination, regardless of the actual ideology of his killer, because his death fits a pre-existing narrative about left-wing campus radicalism that is already the driver of federal policy. We can expect to see an intensification of the Trump administration’s political and legal battles with universities, even tighter scrutiny for faculty and staff (particularly those teaching controversial or sensitive subjects), and the continued erosion of academic freedom on campuses targeted by the administration.\n\n\nThere is also the very real threat of further violence. Scores of prominent MAGA influencers reacted to Kirk’s death by calling for violence against their political enemies. Chaya Raichik, who runs the infamous LibsOfTikTok X account, which before Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover was suspended multiple times for inciting death threats, declared that “THIS IS WAR.” Musk, for his part, wrote that “The Left is the party of murder.” There have already been consequences: On Thursday, at least five HBCUs in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Virginia locked down their campuses due to terroristic threats.\n\n\nChris Rufo Floats Calling in ‘Troops’—The conservative activist says President Trump should consider using the military to dismantle college DEI programs.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/podcast/college-matters-from-the-chronicle/chris-rufo-floats-calling-in-troops\n\nAnd for me, the frame of reference is the campaign to desegregate universities in the 1960s, the early 1960s. And your listeners may recall that in fact, the president of the United States, President Kennedy, actually sent in armed … sent in the 101st Airborne troops to forcibly desegregate universities. I think he established an important precedent and I think the president to this day still retains all remedies up to and including parachuting in the 101st Airborne if these universities continue to discriminate on the basis of race, scapegoat students on the basis of race, and segregate students on basis of race.\n\n\nBut the principle is still the same. Discrimination is discrimination, segregation is segregation, scapegoating is scapegoating. And the precedent is still the same. The president under Article II of the Constitution retains the power to enforce the law, to make sure that universities are adhering with the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act. And I’m not saying that the president should send in the 101st Airborne. I’m merely saying that he retains the right to do so under the Constitution and longstanding precedent.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: What You Need to Know About Police Surveillance\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/15/opinion/nypd-surveillance.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Starts with:)\n\nWherever you go in New York City, there’s a good chance the police are tracking you.

I’ve been very aware of antisemitism since I was a little boy,…I am genuinely startled, though, by the ways Christian nationalists in the American government use Jew hatred as a vehicle to advance their authoritarian agenda. That’s what we are witnessing today: the exploitation of anti-antisemitism by a White House determined to extort money and expressions of loyalty from higher education.\n\n\nThis environment is threatened by the enormous pressure the federal government is putting on higher education to “align its priorities” with those of the president. I am worried about the normalization of this authoritarian effort to reshape the ecosystem of higher education. Too many opportunists and collaborators have been responding by noisily preaching neutrality or just keeping their heads down.\n\n\nSome faculty, student and alumni groups, however, have begun to stand up and make their voices heard. Whether refusing to apologize for diversity efforts or simply standing up for the freedom of scientific inquiry, there is growing resistance to the administration’s attempt to control civil society in general and higher education in particular.\n\n\nWe don’t want the government thinking for us, telling us what the president’s priorities are so that we can imitate them. We want to learn to think for ourselves in the company of others, leaving behind a dependence on authority. Authoritarians would see us impose immaturity upon ourselves. As the new school year begins, we in higher education must redouble our efforts to model and defend the enlightenment ideals of education and freedom—while we still can.",

Hate begets hate. ZERO sympathy,” Sosh-Lightsy wrote in a Facebook post … Tennessee senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, called for Sosh-Lightsy’s firing on X,\n\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, University of Mississippi chancellor Glenn Boyce confirmed the firing of an unnamed staff member who he said “re-shared hurtful, insensitive comments on social media regarding the tragic murder of Charlie Kirk.”\n\n\nAt Baylor University, officials distanced the university from a graduate student who wrote “this made me giggle” in response to a social media post sharing the news of Kirk’s death.\n\n\nThe Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression is monitoring which universities are censoring employee speech, said Lindsie Rank, director of campus rights advocacy at FIRE. “It may not be moral to speak ill of the dead, but it is protected by the First Amendment so we’re going to be keeping our eyes open for those situations,” she said.\n\n\n6 More Faculty, Staff Removed for Kirk Comments\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/09/12/6-more-faculty-staff-removed-kirk-comments\n\nRepublican politicians and other conservatives are calling for employees, including those in higher ed, to be terminated for their social media posts about Kirk’s killing.\n\n\nAt least eight faculty and staff members have been fired or suspended so far for comments they made\n\n\nWorkers are getting fired, placed on leave over Charlie Kirk posts\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/12/workers-fired-charlie-kirk-reaction-online/\n\nNYTimes: Right-Wing Activists Urge Followers to Expose Those Celebrating Kirk Killing\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/us/politics/charlie-kirk-shooting-firings-celebration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nand at least one Trump administration official have actively encouraged people to scour the internet for remarks celebrating the killing and to expose those who have posted them online.\n\n\nChristopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, issued a separate call on Thursday morning, asking his more than 200,000 followers on X to reach out to him with information about “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred.”\n\n\nA Secret Service employee was placed on administrative leave after stating on Facebook that Mr. Kirk had “spewed hate and racism on his show,”\n\n\nAfter Michael Mann, a prominent climate scientist who works at the University of Pennsylvania, reposted a message referring to Mr. Kirk as the “head of Trump’s Hitler Youth,” Dave McCormick, the state’s Republican senator, called it “despicable” and urged the university to “take immediate, decisive action.”\n\n\nRose Pugliese, a Colorado state lawmaker who is a Republican, asked Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, on Thursday to fire a state employee who had accused Mr. Kirk online of being “a white man who spews horrid” words “against every marginalized community.”\n\n\nRepresentative Clay Higgins, Republican of Louisiana, said that he planned to use “Congressional authority” to force tech companies to “ban for life” any person who “belittled the assassination of Charlie Kirk.”\n\n\nJohn C. Phelan, the secretary of the Navy, posted a message saying that sailors or Marines found to be “displaying contempt toward a fellow American who was assassinated” would be “dealt with swiftly and decisively.”\n\n\nTim Weninger, a professor at the University of Notre Dame who studies the ways social media is used to dehumanize people and incite violence, described the targeting campaign as a new front in online rhetoric. “I haven’t seen something like this on social media in America, really ever — it’s a unique moment,” he said.\n\n\nAnastasios Kamoutsas, the commissioner of education in Florida, said in a memo to state superintendents on Thursday that some teachers had made “despicable comments” about Mr. Kirk’s killing and that he intended to investigate every teacher who posted vile, inappropriate messages.\n\n(Also)\n\nRight-Wing Activists Are Targeting People for Allegedly Celebrating Charlie Kirk’s Death\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/right-wing-activists-are-targeting-people-for-allegedly-celebrating-charlie-kirks-death/?_sp=1522a619-e680-429d-9e8c-504e29747171.1757700164905\n\nMAGA’s Doxing War Over Charlie Kirk Is Already Going Off the Rails | The New Republic\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/post/200472/maga-doxxing-charlie-kirk-going-off-rails?utm_campaign=SF_TNR&utm_medium=social&utm_source=Bluesky\n\nAli Nasrati, 30, said he hadn’t posted anything about Kirk but was still publicly doxed over an account using his name and photograph that made posts mocking the right-wing activist,\n\n\nOther instances of doxing appear to have been prompted by unverified information. Ryan Fournier, the national chair of Students for Trump, was forced to walk back accusations of anti-Kirk comments against an elementary school teacher in Wisconsin. “\n\n\nOn Sunday night, an anonymous website collecting reports of anti-Kirk “political extremism” said it had received more than 63,000 submissions.\n\n\nDoxing Campaign Endangers Faculty and Free Speech\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/09/19/right-wing-doxing-campaign-endangers-faculty-and\n\nThe force and scale of the doxing campaigns—and the speed with which institutions have moved to suspend or terminate their targets—paints a grim picture of free speech rights on public college campuses. Widespread doxing as a political tool to punish universities and academics is not a new phenomenon, but right now it’s particularly virulent, explained Keith Whittington, a professor at Yale Law School and an expert on free speech. “The size of the activity, the pressure campaign and the … short period of time is highly unusual,” he said. “Universities feel like they’re under intense pressure to mollify right-wing activists and try not to draw negative attention from the [Trump] administration.”\n\n(This is happening at CUNY)\n\nTexas State professor fired for comments at socialism meeting | The Texas Tribune\n\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2025/09/10/texas-state-university-professor-fired/\n(Also)\n\nA Tenured Professor Spoke Hypothetically About Overthrowing the Government. He Was Fired 3 Days Later.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-tenured-professor-spoke-hypothetically-about-overthrowing-the-government-he-was-fired-3-days-later\n\nA Texas State University professor was fired days after he made remarks the institution’s president described as advocating for “inciting violence,” becoming the second faculty member in the state this week to be swiftly terminated following the release of a viral video.\n\n\nBut experts say there’s an important distinction between the two cases: The Texas State faculty member was an associate professor with tenure, which typically grants several layers of due process before termination, while a Texas A&M senior lecturer who was terminated earlier this week didn’t have the same protections. Two people with knowledge of the situation confirmed to The Chronicle that the Texas State professor had earned tenure at the start of this academic year.\n\n\nThe Texas State Employees Union, of which Alter is a member, said that he was fired “without a hearing or any meaningful opportunity to respond,” and that he only found out about his termination when Damphousse publicly announced it.\n\n\nThe speed of Alter’s termination was legally dubious, higher-ed legal experts told The Chronicle, and violated the principles of academic freedom. While there have been many examples in the past dozen years of social-media campaigns calling for professors to be disciplined or even fired over their speech, Texas State’s near-instant decision to dismiss a tenured professor is rare, said Samantha Harris, a lawyer who defends college professors in disciplinary proceedings.\n\n\n“What Texas State is doing seems to me to be so obviously unlawful — and so likely to lead to a successful lawsuit — that they must be more afraid of something else, like running afoul of the political priorities of state or federal officials,” Harris said.\n\n\nUniversity of Tennessee looks to terminate faculty member over social media post | wbir.com\n\nhttps://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/downtown-ut/ut-employee-charlie-kirk-investigation/51-2b6e9ad8-d0f8-4114-899d-dfccfd4db044\n\nThe University of Tennessee announced it placed one of its faculty members on administrative leave and is beginning termination proceedings against her after Tennessee lawmakers began looking into a social media post claiming she celebrated Charlie Kirk’s assassination on social media.\n\n\nClemson U.

State and congressional lawmakers and right-wing social-media accounts amplify the comments and advocate for the colleges to take disciplinary action. Some lawmakers have threatened to pull funding or enact other consequences if the colleges don’t fire the employees.\n\n(Map of 24 faculty, 13 staff, 3 students; see appendix)\n\nOpinion | The Assassination That Broke Campus Free Speech\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-assassination-that-broke-campus-free-speech\n\nThis was already a theme before Kirk’s murder. Texas A&M University fired a lecturer seemingly at the behest of the governor after politicians objected to the content of her children’s-literature class. Texas State University fired a history professor for his personal advocacy of the organization of a revolutionary socialist party that would aid the working class to “overthrow” the United States government.\n\n\nBut the pressure to patrol speech on college campuses has since reached new intensity. An assistant dean in the Office of Student Care and Conduct at Middle Tennessee State University was fired for a “callous and insensitive” social-media post after Kirk’s death. An English professor at Cumberland University was fired after a U.S. senator called attention to his posts about “a Nazi getting shot.” An art professor at the University of South Dakota was fired after calling Kirk a “hate-spreading Nazi” after his murder. A College of the Sequoias biology professor is under investigation for allegedly telling his class that he hoped Kirk’s whole family would meet the same fate. A Guilford Technical Community College English instructor was fired for praising the assassin to her class. An audio-technology professor at Clemson University has been suspended for mocking Kirk’s death in social-media posts.\n\n\nPublic colleges are legally constrained by the First Amendment in how they can respond to demands to punish students and employees for hateful, morally depraved, or politically incendiary speech. Private colleges have more flexibility, though many have voluntarily tied themselves to First Amendment norms through their own policies. Everyone on campus, including senior university officials, should understand what speech is — and is not — protected under such rules.\n\n\nGiven the misinformation about First Amendment rules routinely spread in public discourse — including by university officials — it is worth clarifying that in the United States, constitutional protections for speech are expansive, a fact not always reflected in the official statements from colleges. Texas State University suggested that speech that “advocates for inciting violence” is unprotected. Clemson claimed that the right to free speech does not extend to expression that “incites harm or undermines the dignity of others.” The chairman of the board at Southern University implied that “distasteful statements” about death are “tantamount to participating and inciting violence and spewing hate,” and thus unprotected. None of this is really true.\n\n\nNYTimes: The Kirk Crackdown Is Underway\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/opinion/trump-charlie-kirk-crackdown.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nPresident Trump and his allies are capitalizing on the assassination of Charlie Kirk to open up fresh attacks on liberal institutions, donors and foundations. They seek to portray many on the left as traitors.\n\n\nTrump and his allies have long exploited “emergencies” to push divisive measures. Now he claims that left-wing terrorism is a greater threat than terror perpetrated by the right, a demonstrably false assertion.\n\n\nTrump and his MAGA followers have not just turned Kirk’s murder into a political weapon; they are trying, with some success, to use it to build a national movement to publicly out everyone who criticized Kirk on social media after his death. They are also trying to persuade employers to fire Kirk’s critics.\n\n\nTrump and Miller have claimed that the Ford Foundation and George Soros’s Open Society Foundations are financing violence on the left.\n\n\nThe political right in the United States has long tried to argue that the political left is responsible for more violence than the political right. That simply hasn’t been true for decades. Lots of folks have surfaced a lot of evidence to illustrate that the far right has been responsible for more violence in the U.S. than the far left, including violent deaths. [Sam Jackson, a professor of emergency management and homeland security at SUNY-Albany]\n\n\nViolent far-right extremist have been responsible for 94 of the 108 terrorism fatalities (87 percent) in the United States in the past five years. This included 2022, when 18 of the 19 fatalities occurred during far-right terrorist attacks.\n\n\nOf the 71 terrorist attacks in 2022, 69 percent were perpetrated by those on the violent far right, 20 percent by the violent far left, 3 percent by Salafi-jihadists and 8 percent by ethnonationalists.

Today the word we hear is “complicity.” What all of these words are meant to suggest is that regimes of fear are never simply top-down affairs. They have a strong bottom-up component as well.\n\n\nUnfortunately, in our discourse today, including on the Left, that bottom-up element is often construed to be a mob of racist randos on social media or rubes in the red states. But that’s a comfort and a conceit. The truth is that collaborators are particular agents, trusted with discrete responsibility and concrete power at various levels, in multiple institutions, making choices, sometimes for the best of reasons, with consequences that they may not intend but that are likely to result anyway.\n\n\nKirk’s Slaying Prompts College Leaders to Speak Out\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/09/17/kirks-slaying-prompts-college-leaders-speak-out\n\nUniversities are making exceptions to institutional neutrality policies to issue statements on Charlie Kirk’s death as some take aggressive action against some faculty remarks.\n\n\nMultiple universities adopted institutional neutrality policies amid the fallout [of the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks], essentially agreeing to refrain from making statements on political matters and to show more restraint, generally, on issuing statements on current events.\n\n\nThe University of Wyoming adopted institutional neutrality in late 2023.\n\n\nBut last week, President Ed Seidel released a statement “expressing disgust, outrage and sadness at this apparent politically motivated attack”\n\n\nAlthough Middlebury does not have an institutional neutrality policy and Baucom [Middlebury President] emphasized he was speaking in his personal capacity, he said that he takes “broad guidance from the University of Chicago’s Kalven principles,” which essentially serve as the bedrock for such policies. But he also noted that the Kalven Report concluded that universities will need to defend their interests and values when “instances will arise” that threaten institutional missions and free inquiry.\n\n\nWhile Greenberg [Lawyer at FIRE] said Clemson’s statement [““We stand firmly on the principles of the U.S. Constitution, including the protection of free speech,..However, that right does not extend to speech that incites harm or undermines the dignity of others.”] was rare, colleges punishing employees for their speech is not. He noted that FIRE is currently receiving tips on “dozens of cases” every day.\n\n\n“We’re in the cancel culture part of the tragedy cycle,” Greenberg said.\n\n\nAbbott Targets Students Who Allegedly Mocked Kirk’s Death\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/free-speech/2025/09/18/abbott-targets-students-who-allegedly-mocked-kirks-death\n\nTop Republican politicians have fueled the ongoing national repression of higher ed employees and others who have allegedly made offensive statements about last week’s shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. But Texas governor Greg Abbott has taken the campaign to another level: going after individual students.\n\n\nAbbott, who has more than 1.4 million followers on X, used that social media website to call for Texas State University to expel a student who appeared to mime Kirk’s shooting at a vigil for Kirk. Shortly after, university president Kelly Damphousse announced that a student in a “disturbing” video “is no longer a student at TXST.”\n\n\nIn another post on X, Abbott applauded Texas Tech University for allegedly expelling and arresting a student.

Mr. Trump’s aides are drafting an executive order that could come as soon as this week, The Times reported, and it will most likely target left-leaning organizations. On Monday, Vice President JD Vance mentioned both the Ford Foundation and George Soros’s Open Society Foundations, saying that they benefited from a “generous tax treatment,” the same tax treatment that benefits nonprofit groups like religious charities and the National Rifle Association Foundation.\n\n\nThe intimidation campaign is already having an effect.\n\n\nNYTimes: We Can No Longer Tell Ourselves This Isn’t Really Happening\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/opinion/jimmy-kimmel-trump-media-government.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUntil Wednesday’s shocking announcement that ABC was cancelling Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show because of comments he made about Charlie Kirk’s killing, it was possible, if one squinted hard enough, to pretend that a broad free speech crackdown was not underway. The down-the-road cancellation of Stephen Colbert’s late-night show on CBS was chalked up to financial concerns, though anyone in the business not paid to think otherwise believes Mr. Colbert’s elegant skewerings of President Trump and MAGA were the real reason.\n\n\nThe silencing of Mr. Kimmel, following an explicit threat by Brendan Carr, the head of ABC’s regulator, the Federal Communications Commission, is the mask of “free speech” coming off for good.\n\n\nThe complaint about so-called big media, historically, was that it was too commercial. Is it possible that these purveyors of popular culture will ignore the 50 percent or more of this country that want television, film and music that doesn’t feel like it was extruded directly from the president’s brain?",

The department offered an answer Monday, announcing plans to repurpose funds from programs “not in the best interest of students and families” to historically Black colleges and universities, tribal colleges, charter schools, and civics education.\n\n(At CUNY some 35 projects impacted by the new DOE directive and the future funding of those projects is $14.1 million; the amount seriously at risk.)\n\n\n\nNIH Now On Track to Spend Its Full Budget by Sept. 30\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/15/nih-now-track-spend-its-full-budget-sept-30\n\nThe National Institutes of Health now appears on track to spend its full $47 billion budget by Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year, STAT News reported Friday. That reflects “a frenzy of grantmaking activity during August,” worth more than $8 billion, STAT noted; the agency was far behind on awarding grants going into the summer, due to delays in the grant review process, the fight over the cap on indirect cost rates and widespread layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\nHowever, STAT’s analysis showed that while the value of the grants awarded is roughly the same, the NIH is funding many fewer new projects this year than in the past. That’s because earlier this year the White House Office of Management and Budget mandated a shift in the way the agency distributes research dollars to a multiyear model, meaning that at least half of all new projects will be funded up front for multiple years rather than receive a new tranche of funding each year.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Shutting Down the War On Cancer\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/14/magazine/cancer-research-grants-funds-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Damning story showing the effects of political malfeasance at the NIH)\n\nWhen America declared war on cancer more than 50 years ago, there was a misguided assumption outside the scientific community that it would be only a matter of years before the disease was eradicated — that defeating cancer would be no different than building an atomic bomb or putting a man on the moon. But there would be no miracle cure: As of this writing, some 40 percent of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their life.\n\n\nAccording to a recent study in The Journal of Clinical Oncology, every $326 that our government spends researching cancer extends a human life by one year. Now an extraordinarily successful scientific research system — one that took decades to build, has saved millions of lives and generated billions of dollars in profits for American companies and investors — is being dismantled before our eyes.\n\n\nIn a matter of months, the Trump administration has canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in cancer-related research grants and contracts, arguing that they were part of politically driven D.E.I. initiatives, and suspended or delayed payments for hundreds of millions more. It is trying to sharply reduce the percentage of expenses that the government will cover for federally funded cancer-research labs. It has terminated hundreds of government employees who helped lead the country’s cancer-research system and ensured that new discoveries reached clinicians, cancer patients and the American public. And the president’s proposed budget for the next fiscal year calls for a more-than-37-percent cut to the National Cancer Institute — the N.I.H. agency that leads most of the nation’s cancer research — reducing it to $4.5 billion from $7.2 billion. Adjusting for inflation, you have to go back more than 30 years to find a comparably sized federal cancer-research budget.\n\n\nIn the absence of any such plan [neither he nor anyone inside his administration has spoken explicitly about its intention to radically rethink how America funds and directs cancer research], it’s hard not to see the ongoing dismantling of the cancer research system as collateral damage in a larger, partisan war against both the predominantly Democratic scientific establishment and the predominantly Democratic academic institutions where much of the country’s biomedical research takes place. And yet the term “collateral damage” suggests a lack of agency; this has been a deliberate and targeted attack. “They have studied how N.I.H. works, studied it hard and learned it well,” says Sarah Kobrin, head of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch at the National Cancer Institute. “And they have put sand in the gears in ways that are very effective, devastating.”\n\n\nNYTimes: California’s $23 Billion Plan to Restore Federal Cuts to Scientific Research\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/california-scientific-research-bond.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nSupporters of the proposal said it would effectively create a state version of the National Institutes of Health or the National Science Foundation, two of the nation’s largest institutional funders of scientific and public health research. The move follows California, Washington and Oregon’s announcement that they would form a health alliance to review scientific data and make vaccine recommendations for their residents, in an attempt to bypass vaccine skeptics in the Trump administration.\n\n\nThe plan to back scientific research calls for lawmakers to pass, and for voters to approve in a 2026 ballot measure, a proposed $23 billion in bonds, financing that will allow the state to make grants and loans to universities, research companies and health care organizations.\n\n\nIt would be the largest state effort of its kind, and is considerably more aggressive than one floated in Massachusetts in July, when Gov. Maura Healey made a $400 million proposal for research there.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEH grant to fight antisemitism is largest ever, signaling Trump-era shift\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/09/16/neh-grant-tikvah-jewish-civilization-project/\n\nThe grant was not part of a competition, and Tikvah was invited to apply, according to two people with direct knowledge of the grantmaking process\n\n\nTikvah is a New York-based think tank and nonprofit that describes its mission as advancing “Jewish excellence and Western civilization through education and ideas.” The group has been associated with conservative U.S. politics. At an upcoming conference, it will award prizes to right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro, Free Press editor Bari Weiss and former Republican adviser Dan Senor.\n\n\nOne of the people said the NEH has justified the large awards because of limited staff resources at the agency, which drastically slashed its workforce in June.\n\n(I have other answers more in line with the Occam’s razor principle)\n\n\n\n\nEducation Department Ends Grant Funding Worth $350 Million for Minority-Serving Colleges\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/us/politics/linda-mcmahon-federal-grants-colleges-universities.html\n(Thanks K!)\n\nU.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon announced Wednesday that she was halting $350 million in federal funding for some of America’s most diverse colleges and universities, saying programs aimed at supporting specific enrollment requirements for minority students were inherently racist.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Redirects Millions to Historically Black Colleges, Charter Schools\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/us/hbcus-trump-administration-funding.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday announced that it would inject nearly $500 million into historically Black colleges and tribal universities, a windfall funded largely by cuts to programs elsewhere for minority students.\n\n\nThe administration will also redirect money to other political priorities for President Trump, including an extra $137 million for American history and civics education and $60 million more for charter schools.\n\n\nTo pay for the changes, the administration cut money from other parts of the education budget The details of the changes were described by three people familiar with the department’s plans who insisted on anonymity to speak about private discussions.\n\n\nThe biggest cut, announced by the department last week, is a $350 million hit to programs that support minority students in science and engineering programs, schools with significant Hispanic enrollment, and other federal grants at minority-serving institutions.\n\n\nPresident Trump has routinely sought to align himself with historically Black colleges and universities as a way to earn good will from Black voters, who have long been skeptical of his leadership.\n\n\nEducation Dept. Halts Funds to Programs for Deafblind Students Over DEI Concerns — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/trump-dei-students-education-deaf-blind-grant-funding\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education has pulled funding for programs in eight states aimed at supporting students who have both hearing and vision loss, a move that could affect some of the country’s most vulnerable students.\n\n\nThe programs are considered vital in those states but represent only a little over $1 million a year in federal money. Nonetheless, they got caught in the Trump administration’s attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion, with an Education Department spokesperson citing concerns about “divisive concepts” and “fairness” in acknowledging the decision to withhold the funding.\n\n\n“I was told that apparently the administration is going through past grants and two words were flagged: One was transition and one was privilege,” Klenz said. “Transition — transitioning from childhood to adulthood. Privilege came up because a parent wrote a glowing review of staff that said what a privilege it was to work with them.” ProPublica obtained a copy of the grant application and confirmed that those words were included.",

But just 20 percent agree that recent federal interventions into campus climates, such as those seen at Harvard and Columbia University—which are unprecedented in scope and speed, and have resulted in the suspension of billions of dollars in unrelated research funding—may be justified.\n\n\nNadell [ Patrick Clendenen Chair in Women’s and Gender History at American University and author of the new book Antisemitism, an American Tradition] continued, “It’s also really important to understand that the leadership of the Republican Party had, well before Oct. 7, been planning an attack on the university.” And there’s “no question, as I see it, that antisemitism has become instrumentalized to do something that the administration and the current leadership has long wanted to achieve.”\n\n\n“This administration is hiding the ball, making it even more combative and more difficult,” Gellman-Beer [a civil rights compliance consultant who handled all manner of shared ancestry complaints under Republican and Democratic administrations through the Office for Civil Rights’ Philadelphia branch] said. “The administration is changing the legal standard with every new letter that comes out. It’s confusing, and it makes senior leaders not necessarily have trust in the process and trust in this administration that what they’re doing is to help the school.”",

The education department has been targeting colleges across the country as part of Donald Trump’s aggressive crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism, international students and academic freedom.\n\n\nJudith Butler, a prominent feminist philosopher and queer theorist, received the letter from David Robinson, UC Berkeley’s chief campus counsel, which said OCR was investigating “allegations of antisemitic harassment and discrimination” and “required production of comprehensive documents”.\n\n\nButler, a Jewish scholar who has been critical of Israel, said on Friday that they had questioned Robinson about the disclosures and said he provided no information on the specific allegations.\n\n\n“We have a right to know the charges against us, to know who has made the charges and to review them and defend ourselves,” they said. “But none of that has happened, which is why we’re in Kafka-land … It is an enormous breach of trust.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/politics/trump-berkeley-antisemitism-investigation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/uc-berkeley-hands-over-160-names-to-the-federal-government-for-potential-connection-to-antisemitism\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: University of California Leaders to Meet as Trump Increases Pressure\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/17/us/university-of-california-berkeley-regents-meeting.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUniversity of California leaders, besieged by a billion-dollar demand from the Trump administration, will meet Wednesday as they weigh how to confront Washington’s campaign to remake American campuses.\n\n\nThe consequences of that effort have become increasingly vivid inside the university, which has been contending with an uproar over its decision last month to comply with federal investigators’ request for information. The university gave the Department of Education the names of scores of students and employees connected to allegations of antisemitism, a move that infuriated people throughout the 10-campus system after word of it emerged this month.\n\n\nThe disclosure deepened the sense of turmoil inside U.C., which is facing an escalating effort from the Trump administration to force changes to one of the nation’s largest and most distinguished university systems. The full Board of Regents has not met in public since mid-July, and the Trump administration’s tactics have gathered far greater force since then.\n\n\nFor example, the government demanded last month that the university pay about $1.2 billion to settle accusations of antisemitism at its Los Angeles campus, and it has pressured administrators there to accept conditions that include steps to ensure “that foreign students likely to engage in anti-Western, anti-American or antisemitic disruptions or harassment are not recruited or admitted.”\n\n\nAhead of Wednesday’s regents’ meeting in San Francisco, Mr. Milliken acknowledged in a statement that threats to the system could metastasize and warned that the federal authorities were “pursuing investigations and actions in various stages against all 10 U.C. campuses.”\n\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the system’s general counsel, Charles F. Robinson, argued that the university had only followed its regular practice of responding to “information requests arising from audits, compliance reviews and investigations.” Mr. Robinson said the university had also made sure to comply with “applicable privacy laws.”\n\n\n“U.C. will continue to meet its legal obligations,” he added, “while exploring all legal avenues to safeguard the privacy and trust of our community members.”\n\n\nBut the litigation from the workers’ groups nevertheless underscored the measured approach that U.C. has adopted so far. Some inside the university are wary of taking steps that could further rile the Trump administration, which has repeatedly cut federal funding to universities to try to bring them to heel.\n\n\nLike other major American universities, U.C. relies on vast sums of federal funding to operate. More than $7 billion goes to research and federal student aid, Mr. Milliken noted this week, while roughly $10 billion more flows from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. (U.C. has six academic medical centers.)\n\n\nGroups sue administration over funding freeze at University of California\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/09/16/groups-sue-administration-over-funding-freeze-university-california/\n\nThe complaint was filed Tuesday in federal district court by the American Association of University Professors, Democracy Forward, and numerous other labor unions and organizations that represent tens of thousands of faculty members, students and staff members across the large public university system.\n\n\nThe lawsuit details numerous demands, also reported Monday by the Los Angeles Times, made by the Trump administration of UCLA. They include eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs; ceding control over university admissions, hiring and curriculum to an outside monitor; reporting student disciplinary records; and other measures.\n\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to exert ideological control over higher education, the lawsuit contends, “through a scheme of targeting, bullying and unconstitutional actions aimed at institutions of higher education across the country.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/17/california-unions-sue-trump-admin-over-threats-uc-system\n\n\n\n\nTexas A&M president resigns after instructor’s firing over gender teachings\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/09/18/texasam-president-resign-mark-welsh-gender/\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nWelsh took over at Texas A&M two years ago after M. Katherine Banks retired as university president in the wake of a scandal involving the botched hiring of journalism professor Kathleen McElroy. That job offer provoked backlash from the Texas GOP because of McElroy’s work on diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which Texas has since banned.\n\n\n“Today, President Welsh has submitted his resignation, and both the Board of Regents and I agree that this is the right moment for change,” Texas A&M Chancellor Glenn Hegar said\n\n\n“It was the right decision for him to do for himself, the university, students, and faculty,” said Leonard Bright, a professor at Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, in a text message. “Now, we look to the university and (board of regents) to conduct an earnest search for a replacement who will fully support the values of academic freedom and protect the university from political interference in our classrooms.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/executive-leadership/2025/09/18/texas-am-president-steps-down-under-pressure\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/us/texas-am-president-gender-ideology-controversy.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe case also raised serious questions about academic freedom at Texas A&M and prompted pushback from faculty members who argued that McCoul’s termination was unnecessary and unjust. The American Association of University Professors also released a statement arguing that the “firings set a dangerous new precedent for partisan interference in Texas higher education.”",

Turning Point USA launched its Professor Watchlist in 2016 to intimidate professors whom the organizations claims “discriminate against conservative students, promote anti-American values, and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.” (Full disclosure: I am on the Professor Watchlist myself, apparently on the basis of my scholarship on the conservative movement and the far right and teaching a class on fascism and antifascism.)\n\n\nBut TPUSA’s attacks on academic freedom have paled in comparison to the Trump administration’s assaults on higher education through funding freezes for basic scientific research, legal attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and the targeting of dozens of universities by the Department of Justice for transparently political reasons. At the University of Virginia, my home institution, DOJ pressure was instrumental in prompting the resignation of the university’s president, Jim Ryan, at the end of June.\n\n\nIt is practically inevitable that there will be dire policy consequences from Kirk’s assassination, regardless of the actual ideology of his killer, because his death fits a pre-existing narrative about left-wing campus radicalism that is already the driver of federal policy. We can expect to see an intensification of the Trump administration’s political and legal battles with universities, even tighter scrutiny for faculty and staff (particularly those teaching controversial or sensitive subjects), and the continued erosion of academic freedom on campuses targeted by the administration.\n\n\nThere is also the very real threat of further violence. Scores of prominent MAGA influencers reacted to Kirk’s death by calling for violence against their political enemies. Chaya Raichik, who runs the infamous LibsOfTikTok X account, which before Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover was suspended multiple times for inciting death threats, declared that “THIS IS WAR.” Musk, for his part, wrote that “The Left is the party of murder.” There have already been consequences: On Thursday, at least five HBCUs in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Virginia locked down their campuses due to terroristic threats.\n\n\nChris Rufo Floats Calling in ‘Troops’—The conservative activist says President Trump should consider using the military to dismantle college DEI programs.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/podcast/college-matters-from-the-chronicle/chris-rufo-floats-calling-in-troops\n\nAnd for me, the frame of reference is the campaign to desegregate universities in the 1960s, the early 1960s. And your listeners may recall that in fact, the president of the United States, President Kennedy, actually sent in armed … sent in the 101st Airborne troops to forcibly desegregate universities. I think he established an important precedent and I think the president to this day still retains all remedies up to and including parachuting in the 101st Airborne if these universities continue to discriminate on the basis of race, scapegoat students on the basis of race, and segregate students on basis of race.\n\n\nBut the principle is still the same. Discrimination is discrimination, segregation is segregation, scapegoating is scapegoating. And the precedent is still the same. The president under Article II of the Constitution retains the power to enforce the law, to make sure that universities are adhering with the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act. And I’m not saying that the president should send in the 101st Airborne. I’m merely saying that he retains the right to do so under the Constitution and longstanding precedent.",

Conservatives cannot fully compete for education grants, or university-level research programs. No, conservatives can’t do any of those things. So we have to figure out what we can do.

Shutting things down is actually a very effective strategy.\n\n\nby spinning off, privatizing and then reforming the student loan programs, I think that you could put the university sector as a whole into a significant recession. And I think that would be a very salutary thing.\n\n\nI think that putting the universities into contraction, into a recession, into declining budgets, into a greater competitive market pressure, would discipline them in a way that you could not get through administrative oversight with 150 extra Department of Ed bureaucrats.\n\n\nI’m sure I missed some big ones.

    "text": "Dear All,\nPlease find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week. Sadly, another far too busy week; one with several executive orders aimed at education; leadership changes at the NSF; actions by numerous college presidents and system leaders; …\n\n\n\nChancellor Matos-Rodriguez emails CUNY faculty and staff about Standing Together.\n\n\nAt the start of the Spring semester, I emphasized the importance of standing together and upholding the values of our University in uncertain times. We have since seen a series of federal actions that have affected CUNY and higher education significantly.\n\n\nThe UFS Executive Committee write a statement Together We Stand.\nHunter Resolution for Mutual Defense passed our Senate by more than 96%!\nPublic Statement: A Call for Constructive Engagement by AAC&U\n\nhttps://www.aacu.org/newsroom/a-call-for-constructive-engagement\nSignatories include Chancellor Matos-Rodriguez and presidents/deans from the GC, Hunter, Hostos, CSI, and BMCC, MEC, York, Queens\n\nBig Ten university faculties push for defense compact against Trump\n\nhttps://wapo.st/3EDjyYi\n\nProgressive Caucus: Open Letter to New York City College and University Presidents\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1h9AatjXiICGMKQgWIeUMOtlc5dNOEUZCUFfwHEBy8pc/edit?tab=t.0\n(thanks VAC)\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Historical Association Statements on Academic Freedom and International Scholars (Thanks EST)\n\nhttps://www.historians.org/why-history-matters/aha-advocacy/resources-for-foreign-scholars/?_zs=30dma&_zl=5RoT4\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Welcome to Trump’s Mafia State\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/opinion/trump-universities-mafia-state.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe pretexts that the administration is using have to do with D.E.I. and antisemitism. The real reasons, I think, are anti-intellectualism and greed, and the fact that Trump is building a mafia state.\n\n\nNow, a mafia state is an absolutely centralized system in which one person, the patron, the don, distributes money and power. And so in order to build a mafia state, such an aspiring patron needs to strip other agents of their money and power.\n\n\nAnd it has the ability to, if not bankrupt universities — it certainly has the ability to bankrupt universities that don’t have significant endowments, which is most of them.\n\n\nThe only way for universities to really address this is to come to terms with the fact that there is no way for them, with this administration, to keep their federal money.\n\n\nFor more on the steps the administration has signaled it might do to gain obesiance, this AAUP white paper from 2024 offers much insight (shared by VC):\n\nhttps://www.aaup.org/file/Manufacturing_Backlash_final_1.pdf\n\nwe have witnessed what one scholar correctly called an “unusually brazen series of challenges to academic freedom,” unleashed by conservative activists and a “national-level political machine” … to undermine academic freedom and university autonomy.\n\nIncluding academic gag orders seeking to ban the teaching of “critical race theory” (CRT); shuttering academic programs; dismantling institutional efforts to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion; weaken tenure protections for faculty; undermined the accreditation process; establish academic programs, centers, and whole schools designed to teach conservative content;\n\nAs this white paper demonstrates, however, this legislation is largely the outgrowth of efforts by right-wing and libertarian think tanks, working closely with Republican politicians, to manufacture a culture-war backlash against educators and academic institutions … as part of a well-organized and well-funded backlash that seeks to roll back the political, social, and cultural gains made in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement increased queer and trans visibility.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Insatiable\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/trump-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n&lt; In order to function effectively, Democracies depend on the ability of the electorate to make what Jackson calls “informed choices.” In this context, Jackson writes, “Knowledge institutions — including universities, the truth-oriented press, government offices with data collection or scientific responsibilities — are crucial for constitutional democracies.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s DOJ Claims Academic Journals Hold “Partisan” Stance in Scientific Debates – Mother Jones\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/04/trump-doj-academic-journals-scientific-debates-chest-journal/\n\nThe publisher of CHEST, a prestigious, peer-reviewed medical journal focused on respiratory health, received a letter from the Trump administration seeking information about how its editors handle scientific controversies and “competing viewpoints.” Some medical professionals see the missive as an attempt to stifle academic freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-DEI Guidance Letter Put On Hold, for Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/24/education-departments-anti-dei-guidance-blocked\n\nFederal judges in New Hampshire and Maryland handed down the rulings after finding plaintiffs in the two separate lawsuits were likely to succeed in proving that the Feb. 14 Dear Colleague letter violated procedural standards and the First Amendment. Prior to the orders, colleges and K-12 schools that failed to comply with the letter risked their federal funding\n\n\n“Although the 2025 letter does not make clear what exactly it prohibits, it makes at least one thing clear: schools should not come close to anything that could be considered ‘DEI,’ lest they be deemed to have guessed wrong,” the New Hampshire judge wrote. And since loss of federal grants could cripple institutions, “it is predictable—if not obvious—that [they] will eliminate all vestiges of DEI to avoid even the possibility of funding termination,” regardless of whether it is an example of executive overreach.\n\n\n\n\n\nMahmoud Khalil: What does my detention by ICE say about America?\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4czL2dT\n\nDetained Tufts student must be transferred to Vermont, judge rules\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/04/19/judge-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-vermont-ice/\n\nFearing Trump’s Visa Crackdown, College Students Race to Scrub Op-Eds - WSJ\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-student-visas-newspaper-op-eds-61595294\n\n\n\n\nWeekly NIH Funding Opportunities and Notices for April 18, 2025\n\n\n(none)\n\n(Thanks MP)\n\nUpdates on NSF Priorities | NSF - National Science Foundation\n\nhttps://www.nsf.gov/updates-on-priorities\n\nResearch projects with more narrow impact limited to subgroups of people based on protected class or characteristics do not effectuate NSF priorities.\n\n\n\nWhat types of awards are being terminated? Awards that are not aligned with NSF’s priorities have been terminated, including but not limited to those on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and misinformation/disinformation.\n\n\n\nNational Science Foundation Terminates Hundreds of Active Research Awards - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/science/trump-national-science-foundation-grants.html\n\nThe grant supported Dr. Fiesler’s research on building A.I. literacy. She received no official explanation for why the grant was being terminated more than a year ahead of its scheduled end. But Dr. Fiesler speculated that it had something to do with the word “misinformation” in the award’s abstract.\n\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the N.S.F. said that its grant cancellations were not in violation of the temporary restraining order. When asked by The Times to provide clarification on the legality of the grant cancellations, the agency declined to comment.\n\n\nLast Thursday, the magazine Nature reported that all new research grants by the agency had been frozen, as ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The N.S.F. declined to confirm the freezing of new awards or what role, if any, DOGE had in the action.\n\n\nNSF Director Resigns\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/25/nsf-director-panchanathan-resigns\n\nHis resignation comes less than one week after he issued sweeping priority changes—including terminating funding for projects that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion or combating misinformation—at the independent agency that funds billions of dollars to nonmedical university research each year.\n\n\n“I believe that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency and feel that it is time to pass the baton to new leadership,” Panchanathan wrote in a resignation letter, first reported by Science. “I am deeply grateful to the presidents for the opportunity to serve our nation.”\n\n\nUnder Panchanathan’s leadership, the NSF’s stated priorities have included increasing diversity in the STEM workforce, forming industry partnerships, job creation and broadening research opportunities for smaller universities and community colleges.\n\n\nTrump is destroying 100 years of competitive advantage in 100 days\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/25/us-losing-competitive-edge-science/\n\nAll three of these forces are now being reversed. The Trump administration is at war with the country’s leading universities, threatening them with hostile takeovers and withholding billions of dollars in research funding. America’s crown jewels of science, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, are being gutted.\n\n\nCUNY’s Research on Vaccine Misinformation Halted by Trump Administration | THE CITY — NYC News\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/04/24/cuny-layoffs-vaccine-research-funding-cuts-misinformation-trump/\n\nBut a day later, on March 11, the NIH terminated a $3.3 million project led by Nash [CUNY faculty member who provided sage advice and was widely cited during the pandemic] that studied whether or not brief digital messages could increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake among adults with mental health issues like anxiety and depression.\n\n\n“We’re looking at letting people go, furloughing them, people losing their health insurance and people losing their opportunity to do the kind of work that they signed up to do,” Nash said.\n\n\n“We’re doing our best to see them through, if they’re finishing their degree with us this year, getting them through to the end,” he added. “Our dean has also offered to try and help where he can. But CUNY is not a university with deep pockets. We don’t have an endowment that we can draw on for these kinds of things.”\n\nIn the Chancellor’s “Stand Together” email we have:\n\nWe are evaluating how changes to funding from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy and other federal agencies will impact our research and programming. Cuts in NIH reimbursements, for example, for operational costs of research and training are being challenged in court, but should they be carried out we estimate that CUNY would receive only about 35% of our expected $12.7 million payment on currently active grants. In addition, 61 CUNY research projects have been subject to stop-work orders from federal agencies.\n\n\nFlorida’s Own DOGE Reviews Faculty Research, Grants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/04/25/floridas-own-doge-reviewing-faculty-research-grants\n\nEarlier this month, the Florida DOGE asked public college and university presidents to provide an account—by the end of last week—of “all research published by staff” over the last six years, including “Papers and drafts made available to the public or in online academic repositories for drafts, preprints, or similar materials.”\n\n\n“If not contained therein, author’s name, title, and position at the institution” must be provided, according to the letters the presidents received. The letters didn’t say what this and other requests were for.\n\n\nThe Florida DOGE also requested information on all grants awarded to institutions over the last six years, asking for each institution’s policy on allocating grants “for purposes of indirect cost recovery, including procedures for calculation.” Further, it requested an account of “all filled and vacant positions held by any employee with a non-instructional role.”\n\n\nBy the end of April, Florida’s public institutions must also provide the “Length of research associated” with each research publication, funding sources associated with the research and any “publications about the research” from the researcher or institution. In addition, the state DOGE is requesting funding sources for each institution’s noninstructional positions and the names of the nonstudent employees administering the grants.\n\n\nAnd that may not be the end of the DOGE demands…\n\n\n\n\n\n“Trump to Sign Executive Order Targeting University Accreditors”\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-accreditors-executive-order-universities-4e4366cc?mod=djemalertNEWS\n(Thanks to DAM for this link).\n\n“Revoking accreditation is an existential threat for these universities,” said Andrew Gillen, a research fellow at the Cato Institute. “If you lose Pell grants and lose student loans, for most colleges that means you’re done.”\n\n\nSome conservatives have called for stronger changes to the watchdog function of higher education, including proposals to make schools accountable for the federal loans their students take out. Right now, schools aren’t penalized if graduates default on loans.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Signs Executive Order Targeting College Accreditors\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/trump-executive-order-university-accreditors.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Along with many others which will prove equally troubling if found legal)\n\n“The federal government has long stayed away from any involvement in a college’s curriculum or hiring, and current law prohibits this kind of intrusion into academic affairs,” Mr. Shireman [a senior fellow at the Century Foundation] said, adding that the executive order “steps far across this line.”\n\n\nMr. Trump also signed executive orders to encourage the use of artificial intelligence in schools, promote private-sector partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities, and increase the number of apprenticeships in skilled trade jobs. Another order instructed his administration to make it more difficult for universities to obscure details of foreign funding.\n\n\nTwo other orders focused on student discipline, which has been a political flashpoint for the past decade.\n\n\nOne order was to ensure that disciplinary policies were not based on D.E.I. policies. Another restricts the use of the so-called disparate impact rule, which civil rights groups have long said is an important tool for showing discrimination against minorities.\n\n\nTrump orders changes to civil rights rules, college accreditation\n\nhttps://wapo.st/42L5uEa\n\nThe EO\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/reforming-accreditation-to-strengthen-higher-education/\n\nAccreditors Sound Off on Executive Order\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/25/accreditors-sound-executive-order\n\nMiddle States issues and Advocacy Alert\n\nhttps://www.msche.org/2025/04/23/advocacy-alert-executive-order-regarding-accreditation/\n\n– The Order directs the Secretary of Education to hold higher education “accreditors” accountable, including through denial, monitoring, suspension, or termination of accreditation recognition, for accreditors’ poor performance or violations of federal civil rights law.\n\n(One might reasonably see this as groundwork to suspend existing accreditors and replace them with more administration friendly/industry unfriendly accreditors)\n\n– The Order mandates the Secretary of Education realign accreditation with student-focused principles by:\n\n\n– Prioritizing intellectual diversity among faculty in order to advance academic freedom, intellectual inquiry, and student learning.\n\n(Viewpoint diversity is perhaps better know as affirmative action for underrepresented political view points)\n\n\n\n\nEO on foreign monies\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/\n\nWith the U.S. cracking down on student loan payments, is college still worth it?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/25/student-loan-payments-collections-college-affordability/\nThis columnists answer: community college for the win\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s destructive war on academia\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/19/trump-harvard-irs-nixon-universities/\n\nPresident Donald Trump has launched a public blitzkrieg against Harvard. On Monday, he froze $2.2 billion in federal funding after the university rejected a far-reaching list of contradictory demands, including the hiring of an external auditor to evaluate the “viewpoint diversity” of its students, faculty, staff and leadership. On Wednesday, Treasury asked the IRS to consider revoking Harvard’s tax-exempt status. (Donations to the university could dry up if they’re not tax-deductible.) Next, the Department of Homeland Security threatened to revoke Harvard’s ability to host international students, who make up 27 percent of the student body. In the coming months, Trump and congressional allies hope to impose devastating taxes on university endowment funds — Vice President Vance has suggested as high as 35 percent — and plan to scrutinize their investments in China and clean energy.\n\n\nAcademic freedom is worth defending. In the long term, this might require colleges to reduce their dependence on federal dollars. In the short term, schools should stick together to resist Trump’s unlawful dictates on what they teach and whom they hire. It is heartening that Harvard’s defiance is already helping to stiffen the backbones of college administrators elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Cornell Cancels Kehlani Performance Over Her Stance on the War in Gaza\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/nyregion/kehlani-cornell-concert-replaced.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump and Vance fear universities for a reason\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4juE7ow\n\nPresident Trump has tested his authority with such force that other institutions—universities, law firms and many lawmakers—have started to fight back\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-authority-resistance-law-firms-universities-424632ae?st=ZS9Wx4&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nCan Colleges Survive Trump’s Cuts\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/can-colleges-survive-trumps-cuts\n\nThe cost of Trump’s proposals could exceed $100 million per year for dozens of institutions, according to analysis by the economist Phillip Levine. And yet the Trump administration has gone even further by withholding nearly all federal grant funding from some elite institutions. Columbia University tried to preserve $400 million in federal funding by agreeing to a list of onerous federal demands that get into the minutiae of academic governance, but even that has not satisfied the federal government.\n\n\nBlue-state public flagship universities are likely the next target, and even institutions that avoid such politicized attention are likely to suffer from structural cuts in federal grants and contracts. These cuts have happened so suddenly that some universities began to take action immediately in order to preserve cash flow, a key lesson from the pandemic. But this is also a longer-term financial issue as 45 months remain in the Trump administration, and there is no guarantee that federal funding returns to normal in 2029.\n\n(Of the 4 steps suggested, only “Conduct layoffs and hiring and spending freezes” appears applicable to CUNY.)\n\nTo this point, the federal government has promised that financial aid to students, the largest source of federal funding to most universities, will not be affected by cuts elsewhere in the Department of Education. But it is possible that the federal government tries to selectively pull federal financial-aid eligibility,\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Tried to Derail Our Work. We Banded Together, and Moved Forward.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/earth-day-nature-report-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nInspiring story of environmental scientists banding together despite federal action.\n\nSomewhere between the desert horizon and the chorus of the U2 song “Stuck in a Moment You Can’t Get Out Of” looping in my mind, it hit me: I had to shake off the despair and get myself together. The project needed to continue. And so with encouragement from friends and mentors, my collaborators and I began reaching out — to potential partners, funders and publishers.\n\n\nWhat we found wasn’t just financial support. It was energy. It was courage. People understood the urgency and the opportunity. And together, we began to reimagine the work not just as a continuation of what had been cut short but also as something new and more alive. A rigorous, independent effort to tell the story of nature in America.\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s freeze on $2.2 billion to Harvard provided no proof of wrongdoing\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/17/harvard-trump-grant-freeze-antisemitism/\n\nNYTimes: Trump Officials Blame Mistake for Setting Off Confrontation With Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/trump-harvard-letter-mistake.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Sure…)\n\nHarvard pushes back on claim that Trump team mistakenly sent demand letter\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/19/harvard-trump-letter-mistake-unauthorized/\n\nNYTimes: In Trump Attack on Harvard, Punishment Before Proof\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/trump-harvard-legal-process.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration has grown so furious with Harvard that it is planning to pull an additional $1 billion of the school’s funding for health research\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-administration-irate-at-harvard-will-pull-additional-1-billion-in-funding-8c209113?st=54dT6c&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nThe government’s set of demands was mistakenly sent a day earlier than the task force intended, but its contents weren’t an error, people familiar with the task force said. The administration stands behind the letter with the demands, a White House spokesman said. The New York Times earlier reported that a government official said the letter was sent mistakenly.\n\n\nEducation Dept. Seeks Records From Harvard Related to Foreign Gifts and Contracts\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/21/education-department-seeks-records-harvard\n\nThe department said Friday that its review of Harvard’s disclosures showed they were “incomplete and inaccurate.” As a result, the department requested records related to all of Harvard’s foreign gifts and contracts and procedures related to complying with Section 117, the federal law that requires the disclosures.\n\n\nHarvard School of Public Health Begins Layoffs As Trump Slashes Funding\n\nhttps://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/4/18/hsph-layoffs/\n\nHSPH spokesperson Stephanie Simon wrote in a statement that the school is facing a “significant budget crisis” and is taking a targeted approach to fiscal austerity by working to “identify strategic priorities and make sustainable budget cuts.”\n\n\n“Unfortunately, this will lead to layoffs,” Simon wrote.\n\n\nThe school is also exiting their leases on two buildings and evaluating their agreements with other buildings to cut expenses “by consolidating onto our core campus,” according to Simon.\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Sues Trump Administration Over Threats to Cut Funding\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/harvard-lawsuit-trump-administration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Protesters Chain Themselves to Columbia Gates, Calling for Activists’ Release\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/columbia-protests-khalil-mahdawi-ice.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Losing International Students Could Devastate Many Colleges\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/us/losing-international-students-could-devastate-many-colleges.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nTrump’s Funding Freezes Halt Medical Research, Deaf Education Training\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/04/21/trump-admin-cuts-halt-medical-research-deaf-ed-training\n\n“This work would have the potential to bring new therapies to patients with these fatal diseases,” said D’Armiento, who also serves as chair of Columbia’s University Senate Executive Committee. She questioned why the government would cancel the funding; it was paying her to conduct research it wanted and benefiting from the fact that Columbia provides her research infrastructure and pays about 80 percent of her salary.\n\n\nHow Europe is quietly stealing America’s scientists\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2025/04/24/how-europe-is-quietly-stealing-americas-scientists-00308988\n\nAcross the EU, an effort is underway to capitalize on the U.S. brain drain, hoping to tap into the exodus of intellectual talent from universities and the federal government. European universities are courting top American scientists and researchers en masse with offers of “academic asylum.” The European Research Council has doubled the funding it offers researchers to move to the continent to €2 million ($2.3 million). A bloc of 12 EU nations are working together to fast-track visas, Horizon Europe grants, and relocation stipends in an effort to poach U.S. brainpower in accordance with their own strategic priorities.\n\n(Scientists leaving Germany in 1939 was one of three reasons for the growth in US research accomplishments in the Zakaria op-ed https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/25/us-losing-competitive-edge-science/)\n\n\n\n\nWhite House Partners With Hillsdale for Lecture Series\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/25/white-house-partners-hillsdale-lecture-series\n\nThe Trump administration also worked with Hillsdale at the end of the president’s first term. In early 2017, Hillsdale officials were part of a commission, chaired by Arnn, that produced the 1776 Report, a widely ridiculed document that academics dismissed as unserious scholarship. Critics argued the 1776 Report provided a whitewashed view of American history, omitted Native Americans entirely and had multiple citation issues.\n\n\n(Hillsdale, a private, Christian institution in Michigan, does not accept federal financial aid.)\n\n\nComing to a theater near you…\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Texts Barnard Employees and Asks if They Are Jewish\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/nyregion/barnard-faculty-eeoc-text-jewish.html\n\nSerena Longley, Barnard’s general counsel, acknowledged in an email to the faculty members that Barnard had provided the commission with the personal contact information of staff members to give them the opportunity to participate. “Participation in the survey is voluntary,” she wrote.\n\n\nMany Jews say Trump is politicizing the fight against antisemitism\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/25/antisemitism-trump-jews-israel/\n\n“Antisemitism is real and it requires robust, constructive solutions,” said Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs. “What’s happening now, though, is exploiting the Jewish community’s legitimate and real concerns about antisemitism to undermine rule of law, due process, educational institutions and our democracy.”\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

The real reasons, I think, are anti-intellectualism and greed, and the fact that Trump is building a mafia state.\n\n\nNow, a mafia state is an absolutely centralized system in which one person, the patron, the don, distributes money and power. And so in order to build a mafia state, such an aspiring patron needs to strip other agents of their money and power.\n\n\nAnd it has the ability to, if not bankrupt universities — it certainly has the ability to bankrupt universities that don’t have significant endowments, which is most of them.\n\n\nThe only way for universities to really address this is to come to terms with the fact that there is no way for them, with this administration, to keep their federal money.\n\n\nFor more on the steps the administration has signaled it might do to gain obesiance, this AAUP white paper from 2024 offers much insight (shared by VC):\n\nhttps://www.aaup.org/file/Manufacturing_Backlash_final_1.pdf\n\nwe have witnessed what one scholar correctly called an “unusually brazen series of challenges to academic freedom,” unleashed by conservative activists and a “national-level political machine” … to undermine academic freedom and university autonomy.\n\nIncluding academic gag orders seeking to ban the teaching of “critical race theory” (CRT); shuttering academic programs; dismantling institutional efforts to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion; weaken tenure protections for faculty; undermined the accreditation process; establish academic programs, centers, and whole schools designed to teach conservative content;\n\nAs this white paper demonstrates, however, this legislation is largely the outgrowth of efforts by right-wing and libertarian think tanks, working closely with Republican politicians, to manufacture a culture-war backlash against educators and academic institutions … as part of a well-organized and well-funded backlash that seeks to roll back the political, social, and cultural gains made in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement increased queer and trans visibility.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Insatiable\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/trump-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n&lt; In order to function effectively, Democracies depend on the ability of the electorate to make what Jackson calls “informed choices.” In this context, Jackson writes, “Knowledge institutions — including universities, the truth-oriented press, government offices with data collection or scientific responsibilities — are crucial for constitutional democracies.”",

Awards that are not aligned with NSF’s priorities have been terminated, including but not limited to those on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and misinformation/disinformation.\n\n\n\nNational Science Foundation Terminates Hundreds of Active Research Awards - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/science/trump-national-science-foundation-grants.html\n\nThe grant supported Dr. Fiesler’s research on building A.I. literacy. She received no official explanation for why the grant was being terminated more than a year ahead of its scheduled end. But Dr. Fiesler speculated that it had something to do with the word “misinformation” in the award’s abstract.\n\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the N.S.F. said that its grant cancellations were not in violation of the temporary restraining order. When asked by The Times to provide clarification on the legality of the grant cancellations, the agency declined to comment.\n\n\nLast Thursday, the magazine Nature reported that all new research grants by the agency had been frozen, as ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The N.S.F. declined to confirm the freezing of new awards or what role, if any, DOGE had in the action.\n\n\nNSF Director Resigns\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/25/nsf-director-panchanathan-resigns\n\nHis resignation comes less than one week after he issued sweeping priority changes—including terminating funding for projects that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion or combating misinformation—at the independent agency that funds billions of dollars to nonmedical university research each year.\n\n\n“I believe that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency and feel that it is time to pass the baton to new leadership,” Panchanathan wrote in a resignation letter, first reported by Science. “I am deeply grateful to the presidents for the opportunity to serve our nation.”\n\n\nUnder Panchanathan’s leadership, the NSF’s stated priorities have included increasing diversity in the STEM workforce, forming industry partnerships, job creation and broadening research opportunities for smaller universities and community colleges.\n\n\nTrump is destroying 100 years of competitive advantage in 100 days\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/25/us-losing-competitive-edge-science/\n\nAll three of these forces are now being reversed. The Trump administration is at war with the country’s leading universities, threatening them with hostile takeovers and withholding billions of dollars in research funding.

But CUNY is not a university with deep pockets. We don’t have an endowment that we can draw on for these kinds of things.”\n\nIn the Chancellor’s “Stand Together” email we have:\n\nWe are evaluating how changes to funding from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy and other federal agencies will impact our research and programming. Cuts in NIH reimbursements, for example, for operational costs of research and training are being challenged in court, but should they be carried out we estimate that CUNY would receive only about 35% of our expected $12.7 million payment on currently active grants. In addition, 61 CUNY research projects have been subject to stop-work orders from federal agencies.\n\n\nFlorida’s Own DOGE Reviews Faculty Research, Grants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/04/25/floridas-own-doge-reviewing-faculty-research-grants\n\nEarlier this month, the Florida DOGE asked public college and university presidents to provide an account—by the end of last week—of “all research published by staff” over the last six years, including “Papers and drafts made available to the public or in online academic repositories for drafts, preprints, or similar materials.”\n\n\n“If not contained therein, author’s name, title, and position at the institution” must be provided, according to the letters the presidents received. The letters didn’t say what this and other requests were for.\n\n\nThe Florida DOGE also requested information on all grants awarded to institutions over the last six years, asking for each institution’s policy on allocating grants “for purposes of indirect cost recovery, including procedures for calculation.” Further, it requested an account of “all filled and vacant positions held by any employee with a non-instructional role.”\n\n\nBy the end of April, Florida’s public institutions must also provide the “Length of research associated” with each research publication, funding sources associated with the research and any “publications about the research” from the researcher or institution. In addition, the state DOGE is requesting funding sources for each institution’s noninstructional positions and the names of the nonstudent employees administering the grants.\n\n\nAnd that may not be the end of the DOGE demands…",

Another order instructed his administration to make it more difficult for universities to obscure details of foreign funding.\n\n\nTwo other orders focused on student discipline, which has been a political flashpoint for the past decade.\n\n\nOne order was to ensure that disciplinary policies were not based on D.E.I. policies. Another restricts the use of the so-called disparate impact rule, which civil rights groups have long said is an important tool for showing discrimination against minorities.\n\n\nTrump orders changes to civil rights rules, college accreditation\n\nhttps://wapo.st/42L5uEa\n\nThe EO\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/reforming-accreditation-to-strengthen-higher-education/\n\nAccreditors Sound Off on Executive Order\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/25/accreditors-sound-executive-order\n\nMiddle States issues and Advocacy Alert\n\nhttps://www.msche.org/2025/04/23/advocacy-alert-executive-order-regarding-accreditation/\n\n– The Order directs the Secretary of Education to hold higher education “accreditors” accountable, including through denial, monitoring, suspension, or termination of accreditation recognition, for accreditors’ poor performance or violations of federal civil rights law.\n\n(One might reasonably see this as groundwork to suspend existing accreditors and replace them with more administration friendly/industry unfriendly accreditors)\n\n– The Order mandates the Secretary of Education realign accreditation with student-focused principles by:\n\n\n– Prioritizing intellectual diversity among faculty in order to advance academic freedom, intellectual inquiry, and student learning.\n\n(Viewpoint diversity is perhaps better know as affirmative action for underrepresented political view points)",

On Monday, he froze $2.2 billion in federal funding after the university rejected a far-reaching list of contradictory demands, including the hiring of an external auditor to evaluate the “viewpoint diversity” of its students, faculty, staff and leadership. On Wednesday, Treasury asked the IRS to consider revoking Harvard’s tax-exempt status. (Donations to the university could dry up if they’re not tax-deductible.) Next, the Department of Homeland Security threatened to revoke Harvard’s ability to host international students, who make up 27 percent of the student body. In the coming months, Trump and congressional allies hope to impose devastating taxes on university endowment funds — Vice President Vance has suggested as high as 35 percent — and plan to scrutinize their investments in China and clean energy.\n\n\nAcademic freedom is worth defending. In the long term, this might require colleges to reduce their dependence on federal dollars. In the short term, schools should stick together to resist Trump’s unlawful dictates on what they teach and whom they hire. It is heartening that Harvard’s defiance is already helping to stiffen the backbones of college administrators elsewhere.",

And yet the Trump administration has gone even further by withholding nearly all federal grant funding from some elite institutions. Columbia University tried to preserve $400 million in federal funding by agreeing to a list of onerous federal demands that get into the minutiae of academic governance, but even that has not satisfied the federal government.\n\n\nBlue-state public flagship universities are likely the next target, and even institutions that avoid such politicized attention are likely to suffer from structural cuts in federal grants and contracts. These cuts have happened so suddenly that some universities began to take action immediately in order to preserve cash flow, a key lesson from the pandemic. But this is also a longer-term financial issue as 45 months remain in the Trump administration, and there is no guarantee that federal funding returns to normal in 2029.\n\n(Of the 4 steps suggested, only “Conduct layoffs and hiring and spending freezes” appears applicable to CUNY.)\n\nTo this point, the federal government has promised that financial aid to students, the largest source of federal funding to most universities, will not be affected by cuts elsewhere in the Department of Education.

Errors will prove costly to borrowers and ultimately, to taxpayers.”\n\n\nNYTimes: ‘Chaos and Confusion’ at the Crown Jewel of American Science\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/health/nih-doge-trump.html\n\nA week after Donald J. Trump was inaugurated, a senior scientist at the National Institutes of Health was preparing to give an invited talk at a scientific meeting when an urgent call came in from an administrative assistant.\n\n\nThere is a total communications ban, the scientist was told, and you cannot give the speech.\n\n\nAs soon as the scientist got back to the office, another ban went into effect — one that prohibited researchers from submitting papers to journals for publication.\n\n\nOne said that DOGE had begun a reign of “chaos and confusion.”\n\n\nHundreds of highly competitive grants that support research at universities and medical schools across the country have been cut. Many of the eliminated grants had descriptions that included terms like “minorities,” “transgender,” “AIDS” and “vaccine hesitancy.” But cuts have also affected research on the chronic diseases that Mr. Kennedy has made his priority; for instance, funding has been cut for a grant to Columbia University for a study that has followed people who have diabetes or are at risk of developing it for more than a quarter-century\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Faculty Protests as Trump Officials Hail University Concessions\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/columbia-trump-response.html\n\nEarlier on Monday, at least 50 professors turned out in a steady drizzle outside the campus gates to protest the funding cuts and what they criticized as Columbia’s conciliatory response. The professors said they hoped to be the vanguard of a resistance movement among academics that remains, for now, at an early stage.\n\n\n“We need to stand up, all of us,” said Michael Thaddeus, a mathematics professor at Columbia and vice president of the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors, speaking to the crowd. “We need to organize, from the grass roots to the national level. If we lead, our leaders will follow.”\n\nNYTimes: ‘It Is Hard to Imagine a More Sweeping Agenda to Make Americans Less Healthy’\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/trump-toxins-cancer-environment.html\nScroll down to find\n\nTurning to the issue of medical research, Duke University provides a case study of the problems facing higher education institutions that are struggling to maintain research budgets under the Trump administration.\n\n\nDonald McDonnell, a professor of molecular cancer biology at Duke whose laboratory has received $40 million from N.I.H. over 30 years, told the A.P. that his lab is likely to go into the red because of the uncertainty of N.I.H. grants, forcing him to order layoffs: “The bottom line is, I can’t live, I can’t think in this chaos,” McDonnell said.\n\n\nThe threatened cuts, according to McDonnell, have endangered the next generation of researchers. Duke medical school has reduced the number of Ph.D. students it will admit from 130 this year to 100 or even fewer in the next academic year.\n\n\nWP: EPA knew it wrongfully canceled dozens of environmental grants, documents show\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/03/25/epa-environment-grants-wrongful-termination/\n\nJulia Haggerty, an associate professor of geography at Montana State University, worked with local partners for almost a year to assemble a competitive application to create a program designed to provide technical assistance and resources to underserved communities.\n\n\nBeginning in January, the program’s funding oscillated between being frozen and unfrozen. The EPA terminated the grant on Feb. 21, saying the “award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities,” according to an email reviewed by The Post.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: As Trump’s Policies Worry Scientists, France and Others Put Out a Welcome Mat\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/europe-trump-science-research.html\n\nthe university [Aix Marseille University] in the south of France known for its science programs, has received about a dozen applications per day from what the school considers “scientific asylum” seekers.\n\n\nIf the movement becomes a trend, it could mean the reversal of the long-term brain drain that has seen generations of scientists move to the United States.\n\n\nFallout from Columbia capitulation fuels fears about academic freedom\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/03/24/fallout-columbia-capitulation-fuels-fears-about-academic-freedom/\n\n“I’m worried that the university’s decision could change how civil rights enforcement works,” Erickson said. “If the Trump administration can declare by fiat that the university is in violation of Title VI protections and withhold funding on that basis — without due process or review — every school district in this country could potentially be told that they are in violation of civil rights law and asked to negotiate.”\n\n\nTrump-Inflicted Funding Cuts Could Lead to Overworked Faculty and Staff, Larger Class Sizes\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-inflicted-funding-cuts-could-lead-to-overworked-faculty-and-staff-larger-class-sizes\n\nWhile the federal government’s $76 billion in emergency aid to higher education from 2020 to 2022 helped colleges get through the Covid financial crisis, research universities may be facing an even more significant financial threat this time around\n\n\nDon’t visit the US – it just isn’t worth the risks right now | Arwa Mahdawi | The Guardian\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/25/dont-visit-the-us-it-just-isnt-worth-the-risks-right-now\n(This was posted in a discussion about holding international conferences in the US.)\n*What Rural Universities Stand to Lose Under Trump’s DEI, Higher Education Cuts — ProPublica\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/regional-public-universities-trump-funding-dei\n\nThat’s because diversity also means something more in regional public universities: Many students at SIU come from families that are poor, or barely middle class, and depend on scholarships and mentorship to succeed. Paul Frazier, SIU’s vice chancellor for anti-racism, diversity, equity and inclusion, said the way DEI has been politicized ignores what it actually does: “Poor doesn’t have a color.”\n\n\n\n\n\nColumbia University caves to demands to restore $400m from Trump administration\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/21/columbia-university-funding-trump-demands\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/facing-a-loss-of-400-million-columbia-u-concedes-to-trumps-demands\n\nNYTimes: Adams Uses Agency ‘Tracker’ to Control Messaging on Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/adams-trump-tracker.html\n\nThe mayor’s office has avoided discussing “Know Your Rights” guidance on how immigrants should respond to federal immigration officials and gender-affirming health care for transgender people, according to one of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\n\nUniversity leaders, pinned between liberal faculty and the Trump administration, are quietly trying to make friends in Washington\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/universities-trump-lobbyists-funding-washington-a2e5c77a?st=j5R8xP&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nNow few House lawmakers—and virtually no Republicans—are interested in going to bat for higher education, lobbyists, trade groups and officials said.\n\n\nDozens of schools, including the University of California system and Harvard, have paused hiring amid concerns over the future of federal funding. The National Institutes of Health normally provides billions of dollars to universities every year for medical and public-health research. Proposed cuts to that funding are now being challenged in courts. In the meantime, some schools have rescinded admission offers to graduate students.\n\n\nWhile many faculty members argue universities shouldn’t yield to Trump, they are in a tricky spot. It isn’t uncommon for a quarter or more of the operating budget of a large university to come from federal sources in the forms of student loans, Pell Grants and research funding—research that supporters say goes on to produce innovations and fuel the broader economy.\n\n\nTrump’s actions constitute a “war on civil society,” Roth [Wesleyan PResident] has told Connecticut lawmakers.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s insecurity state\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4izVKU2\n\n[Trump post] While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House House Governor’s Conference,” he posted, “we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House House Governor’s Conference,” he posted, “we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases.\n\n\nHis administration has also gone after Columbia University, demanding that the school make concessions to not lose $400 million in federal funding. Apparently failing to understand that extortion is rarely a one-time deal, the university agreed to the concessions. (Sure enough, a senior Justice Department official indicated in a recent radio interview that more concessions would be needed.)\n\n\nSo much of what orbits the president is held in place by the gravitational pull of his insecurity.\n\n\nColumbia Capitulated — But So Did the Rest of Higher Ed (Thanks Kimora)\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/columbia-capitulated-but-so-did-the-rest-of-higher-ed\n\n“Unless higher education discovers its collective nerve and collective voice, those who “threaten the very mission of the university and its values of free inquiry” will get precisely what they want. And if it allows such a thing to happen without putting up more of a fight in defense of its mission and social purpose, higher education — it deeply pains me to acknowledge — will get what it deserves.”\n\n\nThis is why all our statements on academic freedom are important. My hope is that they give our political and university leaders some pause before they violate academic freedom as easily as they recently did at Hunter. Moreover, they show how each governing body is dealing with the challenges to higher education, and thus preparing their constituents for the challenges to come.\n\n(Thanks EI)\n\nNYTimes: University of Michigan to Scuttle Its Flagship D.E.I.

But it may not pass. Even if it does, the universities that survive may be weakened, frightened shadows of their former selves.\n\n\nNYTimes: ‘This Is Worse’: Trump’s Judicial Defiance Veers Beyond the Autocrat Playbook\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/europe/trump-courts-defiance-autocrats-playbook.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(While not about higher education, this article compares the Trump Adminstrations to other autocratic regime’s approach to capturing the judicial system.)\n\n“We look at these comparative cases in the 21st century, like Hungary and Poland and Turkey. And in a lot of respects, this is worse,” he said. “These first two months have been much more aggressively authoritarian than almost any other comparable case I know of democratic backsliding.”\n\n\nTrump can’t fix American universities by breaking them\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4bOsq9T\n\nFlorida pioneered the kind of crackdown the Trump administration is attempting, and now more left-leaning students and professors in that state have begun describing exactly the kind of speech-chilling atmosphere that conservatives have been complaining about for years. Professors there have steered students away from discussing topics that seem forbidden, including “intersectionality,” and are afraid that students are recording them, the Wall Street Journal has reported. Students voiced similar fears that classmates would broadcast their remarks on social media, and one student publication trimmed its coverage to protect its funding\n\n\nNYTimes: $15 Billion Is Enough to Fight a President\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/trump-university-endowment-spending.html\n\nThus far, university presidents have largely kept their heads down rather than uniting to oppose Mr. Trump’s assault. That is a mistake. A key authoritarian strategy is to single out prominent individuals or institutions for repression so that others, afraid, forgo legitimate criticism of the authoritarian leader. Often, universities are some of the first institutions that authoritarians attack. Make no mistake, the Trump administration’s punitive cuts to federal research grants and detention of university students or faculty, couched under the President’s grievances over diversity programs and campus protests, are early signs of this strategy at work in America.\n\n\nLegal scholars on what Columbia University should have done — and what other colleges could do next.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/it-is-remarkable-how-quickly-the-chill-has-descended\n\nwith the exceptions of the presidents of Brown and Princeton, the leadership of academia has been pretty much absent; everyone is taking a duck-and-cover attitude. So Armstrong [Columbia’s President] felt she was on her own. That’s my most sympathetic read, even though I wish she had taken a firmer stand.\n\n\nSo there’s this very rational cost-benefit analysis where administrators are thinking, “Well, if we speak up and others do not …” It’s a collective-action problem in which, in the moment, it’s always easier not to speak. This is why we have free-speech protections — speech is easily chilled. It is remarkable how quickly the chill has descended.\n\n\nA less sympathetic reading: My sense of what was motivating both the Paul Weiss and Columbia leadership is a view that the concessions being demanded were not very significant.\n\n\nThat in itself is a significant indication of where we are. I’ve been reading all the free-speech policies at different schools. There’s lovely language in the policies about how universities are sites of dissent and how protest is meant to be valued. About how we want to give our students the freedom to question what is in the classroom and what’s outside the classroom. Chicago has a wonderful statement written by David Strauss, who was the head of the ad-hoc committee on protest and dissent, in which he says protest is not only integral to the life of the university because we are a community of dissent, but administrators should strive to problem-solve. So when students break the rules, don’t use discipline. Try to figure out what the cause of their concern is. Since October 7, there has been a demise of that kind of talking and that kind of imagining.\n\n\nIt feels like we are saying goodbye to this beautiful democratic vision of the university and we are now thinking of the university as a place where order must be maintained.\n\n\nThis Time, Higher Ed’s Resistance to Trump is Being Led by Its Associations\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/this-time-higher-eds-resistance-to-trump-is-being-led-by-its-associations\n(The board of ACE is chaired by CUNY’s Chancellor.)\n\nin opening remarks at ACE’s annual conference, Mitchell [ACE’s President] condemned Trump’s actions in unusually strong words. “The flurry of these threats,” he said, “were designed to cow us into silence. When we face threats, we will not cower.”\n\n\nTo Todd Wolfson, president of the AAUP, doing so [joining a lawsuite] was a necessity. “It’s our job to protect our members and to protect their places of employment and their sector,” he said. “If somebody wants to argue with me that’s not the role of unions and associations, I’d love to hear it. But I think this is a fundamental duty of ours, if not the fundamental duty.”\n\n\nNYTimes: David Leonhardt on How Universities Can Stop Trump’s ‘Destroying Agenda’\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/opinion/universities-trump-fight-back.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLeonhardt: It’s important to say that a lot of the conservative critics of universities, including Christopher Rufo, also don’t want a fully open debate. They want to restrict debate in many cases so that it’s just their view of the world. They want to take books out of schools about L.G.B.T. people. That’s really damaging.\n\n\nA world in which Donald Trump’s ideological enforcers are going through a course catalog or telling schools exactly what their admissions policies need to be, rather than letting schools follow the Supreme Court ruling on it, would be a really damaging world.\n\n\nI think we’re on track at a lot of universities and also law firms and other institutions that you’ve written about where people are going to say: Well, can I make a deal with Trump or can I keep my head down and stay out of the line of fire? Maybe not appreciating that this guy and the people around him like Chris Rufo are on a war footing.\n\n\nDear Colleagues: The Time for Boldness Is Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/03/27/letter-faculty-self-censorship-and-boldness-opinion\n\nI do not deny that we are living in perilous times, but what good are academic freedom and tenure if we do not use them? Some think, I believe mistakenly, that speaking out will only embolden the attacks on higher education institutions and faculty. I, instead, am more compelled by Frederick Douglass’s proclamation, “Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted …”\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: U.S. Lodges New Accusations Against Detained Columbia Protest Leader\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-trump-allegations.html\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be using the new allegations in part to sidestep the First Amendment issues raised by Mr. Khalil’s case. On Sunday, in a filing opposing his release, Justice Department lawyers argued that the new allegations reduced the importance of concerns about Mr. Khalil’s right to free speech.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow an Accreditation War Could Start\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-an-accreditation-war-could-start\n\nNow President Trump threatens to wield accreditation as a weapon, something which, if carried out, would muzzle the creativity and innovation that has fueled America’s lead.\n\n\nWhat stands in Trump’s way? The federal law establishing the Department of Education prohibits federal interference in curricular matters. That federal law would change, however, if the department is eliminated.\n\n\nAnother obstacle is the First Amendment: If the administration were to directly attack accreditors’ opinions or academic perspectives, they would expose themselves to legal challenges. The administration could respond to this by claiming a national-security concern (say, holding that diversity, equity, and inclusion are part of a Marxist threat to America).\n\n\nIf you have stories you would like me to include in anticipated future digests, please send along via an email to me directly (john.verzani@csi.cuny.edu).",

Trump was inaugurated, a senior scientist at the National Institutes of Health was preparing to give an invited talk at a scientific meeting when an urgent call came in from an administrative assistant.\n\n\nThere is a total communications ban, the scientist was told, and you cannot give the speech.\n\n\nAs soon as the scientist got back to the office, another ban went into effect — one that prohibited researchers from submitting papers to journals for publication.\n\n\nOne said that DOGE had begun a reign of “chaos and confusion.”\n\n\nHundreds of highly competitive grants that support research at universities and medical schools across the country have been cut. Many of the eliminated grants had descriptions that included terms like “minorities,” “transgender,” “AIDS” and “vaccine hesitancy.” But cuts have also affected research on the chronic diseases that Mr. Kennedy has made his priority; for instance, funding has been cut for a grant to Columbia University for a study that has followed people who have diabetes or are at risk of developing it for more than a quarter-century\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Faculty Protests as Trump Officials Hail University Concessions\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/columbia-trump-response.html\n\nEarlier on Monday, at least 50 professors turned out in a steady drizzle outside the campus gates to protest the funding cuts and what they criticized as Columbia’s conciliatory response. The professors said they hoped to be the vanguard of a resistance movement among academics that remains, for now, at an early stage.\n\n\n“We need to stand up, all of us,” said Michael Thaddeus, a mathematics professor at Columbia and vice president of the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors, speaking to the crowd. “We need to organize, from the grass roots to the national level. If we lead, our leaders will follow.”\n\nNYTimes: ‘It Is Hard to Imagine a More Sweeping Agenda to Make Americans Less Healthy’\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/trump-toxins-cancer-environment.html\nScroll down to find\n\nTurning to the issue of medical research, Duke University provides a case study of the problems facing higher education institutions that are struggling to maintain research budgets under the Trump administration.\n\n\nDonald McDonnell, a professor of molecular cancer biology at Duke whose laboratory has received $40 million from N.I.H. over 30 years, told the A.P. that his lab is likely to go into the red because of the uncertainty of N.I.H. grants, forcing him to order layoffs: “The bottom line is, I can’t live, I can’t think in this chaos,” McDonnell said.\n\n\nThe threatened cuts, according to McDonnell, have endangered the next generation of researchers. Duke medical school has reduced the number of Ph.D. students it will admit from 130 this year to 100 or even fewer in the next academic year.\n\n\nWP: EPA knew it wrongfully canceled dozens of environmental grants, documents show\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/03/25/epa-environment-grants-wrongful-termination/\n\nJulia Haggerty, an associate professor of geography at Montana State University, worked with local partners for almost a year to assemble a competitive application to create a program designed to provide technical assistance and resources to underserved communities.\n\n\nBeginning in January, the program’s funding oscillated between being frozen and unfrozen. The EPA terminated the grant on Feb. 21, saying the “award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities,” according to an email reviewed by The Post.",

Paul Frazier, SIU’s vice chancellor for anti-racism, diversity, equity and inclusion, said the way DEI has been politicized ignores what it actually does: “Poor doesn’t have a color.”",

The National Institutes of Health normally provides billions of dollars to universities every year for medical and public-health research. Proposed cuts to that funding are now being challenged in courts. In the meantime, some schools have rescinded admission offers to graduate students.\n\n\nWhile many faculty members argue universities shouldn’t yield to Trump, they are in a tricky spot. It isn’t uncommon for a quarter or more of the operating budget of a large university to come from federal sources in the forms of student loans, Pell Grants and research funding—research that supporters say goes on to produce innovations and fuel the broader economy.\n\n\nTrump’s actions constitute a “war on civil society,” Roth [Wesleyan PResident] has told Connecticut lawmakers.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s insecurity state\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4izVKU2\n\n[Trump post] While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House House Governor’s Conference,” he posted, “we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House House Governor’s Conference,” he posted, “we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases.\n\n\nHis administration has also gone after Columbia University, demanding that the school make concessions to not lose $400 million in federal funding. Apparently failing to understand that extortion is rarely a one-time deal, the university agreed to the concessions. (Sure enough, a senior Justice Department official indicated in a recent radio interview that more concessions would be needed.)\n\n\nSo much of what orbits the president is held in place by the gravitational pull of his insecurity.\n\n\nColumbia Capitulated — But So Did the Rest of Higher Ed (Thanks Kimora)\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/columbia-capitulated-but-so-did-the-rest-of-higher-ed\n\n“Unless higher education discovers its collective nerve and collective voice, those who “threaten the very mission of the university and its values of free inquiry” will get precisely what they want. And if it allows such a thing to happen without putting up more of a fight in defense of its mission and social purpose, higher education — it deeply pains me to acknowledge — will get what it deserves.”\n\n\nThis is why all our statements on academic freedom are important. My hope is that they give our political and university leaders some pause before they violate academic freedom as easily as they recently did at Hunter. Moreover, they show how each governing body is dealing with the challenges to higher education, and thus preparing their constituents for the challenges to come.\n\n(Thanks EI)\n\nNYTimes: University of Michigan to Scuttle Its Flagship D.E.I. Program\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/education/university-of-michigan-dei.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare ## Un-bent knee\n\nHow a University Fights an Authoritarian Regime\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-a-university-fights-an-authoritarian-regime\n\nMake the case to the public that these attacks are senseless assaults on institutions that promote what America is famous for: life-saving science and world-class innovation.\n\n\nAt CEU we framed Orbán’s attack as an affront to academic freedom in Europe, indeed the most serious one since the 1930s.\n\n\nFaced with Kulturkampf waged by a ferociously ideological administration intent on neutralizing academe as a critical voice, university presidents will be inclined to hunker down and wait for the storm to pass. But it may not pass. Even if it does, the universities that survive may be weakened, frightened shadows of their former selves.\n\n\nNYTimes: ‘This Is Worse’: Trump’s Judicial Defiance Veers Beyond the Autocrat Playbook\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/europe/trump-courts-defiance-autocrats-playbook.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(While not about higher education, this article compares the Trump Adminstrations to other autocratic regime’s approach to capturing the judicial system.)\n\n“We look at these comparative cases in the 21st century, like Hungary and Poland and Turkey. And in a lot of respects, this is worse,” he said. “These first two months have been much more aggressively authoritarian than almost any other comparable case I know of democratic backsliding.”\n\n\nTrump can’t fix American universities by breaking them\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4bOsq9T\n\nFlorida pioneered the kind of crackdown the Trump administration is attempting, and now more left-leaning students and professors in that state have begun describing exactly the kind of speech-chilling atmosphere that conservatives have been complaining about for years. Professors there have steered students away from discussing topics that seem forbidden, including “intersectionality,” and are afraid that students are recording them, the Wall Street Journal has reported. Students voiced similar fears that classmates would broadcast their remarks on social media, and one student publication trimmed its coverage to protect its funding\n\n\nNYTimes: $15 Billion Is Enough to Fight a President\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/trump-university-endowment-spending.html\n\nThus far, university presidents have largely kept their heads down rather than uniting to oppose Mr. Trump’s assault. That is a mistake. A key authoritarian strategy is to single out prominent individuals or institutions for repression so that others, afraid, forgo legitimate criticism of the authoritarian leader. Often, universities are some of the first institutions that authoritarians attack. Make no mistake, the Trump administration’s punitive cuts to federal research grants and detention of university students or faculty, couched under the President’s grievances over diversity programs and campus protests, are early signs of this strategy at work in America.\n\n\nLegal scholars on what Columbia University should have done — and what other colleges could do next.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/it-is-remarkable-how-quickly-the-chill-has-descended\n\nwith the exceptions of the presidents of Brown and Princeton, the leadership of academia has been pretty much absent; everyone is taking a duck-and-cover attitude. So Armstrong [Columbia’s President] felt she was on her own. That’s my most sympathetic read, even though I wish she had taken a firmer stand.\n\n\nSo there’s this very rational cost-benefit analysis where administrators are thinking, “Well, if we speak up and others do not …” It’s a collective-action problem in which, in the moment, it’s always easier not to speak. This is why we have free-speech protections — speech is easily chilled. It is remarkable how quickly the chill has descended.\n\n\nA less sympathetic reading: My sense of what was motivating both the Paul Weiss and Columbia leadership is a view that the concessions being demanded were not very significant.\n\n\nThat in itself is a significant indication of where we are. I’ve been reading all the free-speech policies at different schools. There’s lovely language in the policies about how universities are sites of dissent and how protest is meant to be valued. About how we want to give our students the freedom to question what is in the classroom and what’s outside the classroom. Chicago has a wonderful statement written by David Strauss, who was the head of the ad-hoc committee on protest and dissent, in which he says protest is not only integral to the life of the university because we are a community of dissent, but administrators should strive to problem-solve. So when students break the rules, don’t use discipline. Try to figure out what the cause of their concern is. Since October 7, there has been a demise of that kind of talking and that kind of imagining.\n\n\nIt feels like we are saying goodbye to this beautiful democratic vision of the university and we are now thinking of the university as a place where order must be maintained.\n\n\nThis Time, Higher Ed’s Resistance to Trump is Being Led by Its Associations\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/this-time-higher-eds-resistance-to-trump-is-being-led-by-its-associations\n(The board of ACE is chaired by CUNY’s Chancellor.)\n\nin opening remarks at ACE’s annual conference, Mitchell [ACE’s President] condemned Trump’s actions in unusually strong words. “The flurry of these threats,” he said, “were designed to cow us into silence. When we face threats, we will not cower.”\n\n\nTo Todd Wolfson, president of the AAUP, doing so [joining a lawsuite] was a necessity. “It’s our job to protect our members and to protect their places of employment and their sector,” he said. “If somebody wants to argue with me that’s not the role of unions and associations, I’d love to hear it. But I think this is a fundamental duty of ours, if not the fundamental duty.”\n\n\nNYTimes: David Leonhardt on How Universities Can Stop Trump’s ‘Destroying Agenda’\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/opinion/universities-trump-fight-back.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLeonhardt: It’s important to say that a lot of the conservative critics of universities, including Christopher Rufo, also don’t want a fully open debate. They want to restrict debate in many cases so that it’s just their view of the world. They want to take books out of schools about L.G.B.T. people. That’s really damaging.\n\n\nA world in which Donald Trump’s ideological enforcers are going through a course catalog or telling schools exactly what their admissions policies need to be, rather than letting schools follow the Supreme Court ruling on it, would be a really damaging world.\n\n\nI think we’re on track at a lot of universities and also law firms and other institutions that you’ve written about where people are going to say: Well, can I make a deal with Trump or can I keep my head down and stay out of the line of fire? Maybe not appreciating that this guy and the people around him like Chris Rufo are on a war footing.\n\n\nDear Colleagues: The Time for Boldness Is Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/03/27/letter-faculty-self-censorship-and-boldness-opinion\n\nI do not deny that we are living in perilous times, but what good are academic freedom and tenure if we do not use them? Some think, I believe mistakenly, that speaking out will only embolden the attacks on higher education institutions and faculty. I, instead, am more compelled by Frederick Douglass’s proclamation, “Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted …”",

    "text": "Dear All,\nPlease find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week. Sadly another terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week. More tricks (re) employed: monkeying with grants; tax-exempt status; accreditation; student visas; and a Draconian proposed budget. Atleast it seems clear – resistance is the only means forward.\n\n\n\nSeveral CUNY senates have passed alliance resolutions\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/my5g55jprx5o64r4vzus0/ABqQBAimqk_KN5t-EsUG8Ds/1.Mutual%20Defense%20Statements?dl=0&rlkey=zvsqtp7ev781y4rqqjti8xaho&subfolder_nav_tracking=1\nThese include BMCC, CCNY, Hostos, Hunter, QBCC, and the UFS XC. (Apologies if any are not included)\n\nPSC, UUP, and NYSUT (representing public higher education in NY State) speak out in a press statement\n\nhttps://psc-cuny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/State-Ed-leaders-call-on-Chancellors-challenge-Trump-administration-attacks-on-the-public-higher-education-systems.pdf\n\nWe Must Leverage the Strength of Our Institutions and Stand Together\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/we-must-leverage-the-strength/home\n\nDear Presidents, Chancellors, and Boards of Trustees of the 60 Universities that received a March 10th warning letter from the U.S. Department of Education:\n\n\nYou are on the frontlines of a war that is unfolding against U.S. higher education. We look to you for leadership and coalition-building during a time when the stakes have never been higher.\n\n\nWe ask all sixty institutions under government threat to unite in a coordinated, proactive defense.\n\n(~3009 signatories)\n\nAdvocating for Brown – What’s at stake | Office of the President | Brown University\n\nhttps://president.brown.edu/president/advocating-brown-whats-stake\n\nIt’s important to share what is at stake for Brown. The research funding cuts that Brown has already suffered are causing immediate harm, forcing us to reconfigure our operations and budget to address funding shortfalls. Any long-term cuts of significant magnitude would imperil, or possibly end, several areas of high-impact research at Brown. This would be devastating to Brown’s research community, including the undergraduate, graduate and medical students we teach, and the people, patients and communities that benefit from the results of our research.\n\n\nEven more concerning, since early April, Brown has not been reimbursed for any expenses associated with active (i.e., not terminated) grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), whose grants make up roughly 70% of Brown’s overall research portfolio. Again, we have not been given any official explanation for why expenses for active grants are not being reimbursed.

When Mr. Trump began threatening the university with canceled funds this spring, many Harvard professors and students urged administrators to head straight to the ramparts and denounce him. Alan Garber, Harvard’s president, took a wiser approach. He acknowledged that some of Mr. Trump’s criticisms had merit. Harvard, like much of elite higher education, has, in fact, been blasé about antisemitism, and it has too often prioritized progressive ideology over an independent search for truth.\n\n\nBy admitting as much, Mr. Garber strengthened Harvard’s political position. He said what many Americans believed. But when the administration issued a list of ludicrous demands, Harvard fought back hard. It filed a lawsuit, with help from a legal team that included conservative litigators, and became a national symbol of resistance to his lawlessness. Mr. Garber made Harvard look reasonable and Mr. Trump unreasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Road Map of Trump’s Lawless Presidency, According to 35 Legal Scholars\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/opinion/trump-constitution-rule-of-law.html?unlocked_article_code=1.DE8.cUMD.AE-5Mjxg6jlf&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe disregard for law is itself part of the agenda.

You need to trace its roots in the 1960s, its evolution through the culture wars of the 1980s and ’90s, and into the current populist fray. Then you need to do something about it. Professors, administrators, students, and concerned citizens can no longer stand on the sidelines, shaking our heads and deploring the potentially devastating consequences. The simple truth is this: For decades, outside forces have — both consciously and unintentionally — undermined the integrity and quality of public higher education in America. And time and time again, a divided academic community has failed to combat them effectively. We can and must do better. Seeds of resistance are sprouting. Together, we must nurture their growth.

With labs, dormitories, lecture halls, athletic facilities, and so much else, colleges have exorbitant fixed costs. Those fixed costs have typically been covered in large part by student enrollment. Now that enrollment is declining, higher education’s cost curve is breaking. No amount of cutting will fix the underlying problem. Many colleges have masked their operating deficiencies by using Covid-relief funds in the past few years, but now, with those funds exhausted, they are dealing with a broken economic model. The Trump administration’s cuts to research funding are adding additional stress to colleges’ already precarious cost structure.\n\n\nMore damaging than the cost curve is the shift in how students view the value of higher education. Having grown up with Amazon, Netflix, and Google, students expect a speedy, on-demand, and low-friction experience. Moreover, they increasingly view college through a transactional lens: They pursue a degree to get a job. So they regard college much like any other consumer product, and like those other products, they expect it to be delivered how they want, when they want.

The university’s president, James E. Ryan, said the move signaled that “becoming a more diverse, equitable place is both the right and the smart thing to do.”\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the board voted unanimously to rescind any such numerical goals as part of a sweeping effort to wipe out evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The Trump administration had warned university officials, only the day before, that it had received complaints that the university wasn’t acting fast enough to carry through on its promise to “dismantle DEI apparatuses.”\n\n\nIn its letter on Monday, the Justice Department said the president had failed to produce a sufficiently detailed progress report. (A campus spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about whether the required report had been submitted.) It demanded that Ryan and Hardie certify by Friday that the vestiges of DEI have been removed from every division, department, program, and school.\n\n\nThe Board of Visitors deliberated during a closed session on Tuesday. The public portion of the meeting was not live-streamed. It’s unclear whether the board brought up the fact that Ryan, who became president in 2018, was one of more than 550 higher-education leaders who signed a statement circulated by the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) that condemned “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe.\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate was concerned enough about the board’s reaction that on Monday, it passed a resolution supporting Ryan and his decision to sign the AAC&U statement, saying it “expresses principles that are essential to upholding UVA’s mission, reputation, and operations.”\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate had encouraged Ryan to collaborate with other university presidents to promote higher education’s contributions to the nation.

Newton wrote in an email. “It would result in diminished financial aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs, and lost opportunities for innovation.

We look to you for leadership and coalition-building during a time when the stakes have never been higher.\n\n\nWe ask all sixty institutions under government threat to unite in a coordinated, proactive defense.\n\n(~3009 signatories)\n\nAdvocating for Brown – What’s at stake | Office of the President | Brown University\n\nhttps://president.brown.edu/president/advocating-brown-whats-stake\n\nIt’s important to share what is at stake for Brown. The research funding cuts that Brown has already suffered are causing immediate harm, forcing us to reconfigure our operations and budget to address funding shortfalls. Any long-term cuts of significant magnitude would imperil, or possibly end, several areas of high-impact research at Brown. This would be devastating to Brown’s research community, including the undergraduate, graduate and medical students we teach, and the people, patients and communities that benefit from the results of our research.\n\n\nEven more concerning, since early April, Brown has not been reimbursed for any expenses associated with active (i.e., not terminated) grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), whose grants make up roughly 70% of Brown’s overall research portfolio. Again, we have not been given any official explanation for why expenses for active grants are not being reimbursed. These unreimbursed expenses, which amount to millions of dollars per week, represent a significant threat to Brown’s financial sustainability and its ability to conduct federally funded research.\n\n\nAs we navigate the current environment, I continue to share a set of core principles:\n\n\nBrown will always defend the ability for students and scholars to teach and learn without fear of government intrusion or censorship, which is fundamental to efforts to protect academic freedom.\n\n\nBrown is deeply committed to following the law and maintaining an academic community where all can participate fully in the life of the institution. This means maintaining a campus that is free of all forms of harassment and discrimination for all community members, including addressing allegations of discrimination based on shared ancestry. We are proud of our initiatives to combat antisemitism, many of which we launched even before this became a major area of focus for the federal government.\n\n\nBrown will continue to provide resources and support to members of our international community."

And faculty members at the Big Ten universities are ramping up pressure on their institutions to collaborate and defend one another against threats from the administration.\n\n\nMore and More Faculty Groups Want Their Colleges to Stand Together Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/more-and-more-faculty-groups-want-their-colleges-to-stand-together-against-trump\n\nFaculty senates across the nation are endorsing the idea of standing collectively against the actions of the Trump administration. Ten of the Big Ten’s 18 member institutions have adopted resolutions in recent weeks calling for an alliance among that group’s members, and on Saturday the State University of New York’s University Faculty Senate also endorsed a mutual-defense compact.\n\n\nWithin the City University of New York system, the Senates at Hunter College, Hostos Community College, and the City College of New York have done the same for a New York-based effort.\n\n\nSupport for mutual-defense compacts has come alongside several other efforts to stand against the Trump administration’s actions, among them the AAC&U statement condemning “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe, which now has been signed by more than 500 higher-ed leaders.\n\n\nPresidents and trustees from about 10 institutions have also formed an informal private collective to discuss possible responses to the administration, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The Journal did not name those institutions but noted that they included Ivy League campuses and top private research universities, primarily in blue states.\n\n\nA call for unity among researchers, libraries, publishers, journalists and the public in fighting the Trump administration.\n\nhttps://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2025/04/30/trump-v-research-how-we-could-turn-the-threats-into-opportunities/\n(Thanks BE!)\n\n“while it’s encouraging to see some organizations coming together within their existing siloes, that’s not enough. There’s a real opportunity – and imperative – for all stakeholders in the research community to join forces. Each group plays a vital role in the research endeavor. Now is the time to show our support for everyone’s contributions, and to help everyone understand that, by dismantling the research infrastructure through censorship and defunding, we hamper research progress and its benefits in the US and across the world. We call on the industry bodies that represent all these different stakeholders to leverage their relationships and networks to develop something that’s bigger than just a campaign — a movement that spans all individuals and organizations working to fund, conduct, support, and disseminate the science and scholarship essential for our survival and success.\n\n\n“So let’s set aside our usual disagreements (open access business models, pricing, copyright, etc., etc.) to focus on what’s really important right now.

When Mr. Trump began threatening the university with canceled funds this spring, many Harvard professors and students urged administrators to head straight to the ramparts and denounce him. Alan Garber, Harvard’s president, took a wiser approach. He acknowledged that some of Mr. Trump’s criticisms had merit. Harvard, like much of elite higher education, has, in fact, been blasé about antisemitism, and it has too often prioritized progressive ideology over an independent search for truth.\n\n\nBy admitting as much, Mr. Garber strengthened Harvard’s political position. He said what many Americans believed. But when the administration issued a list of ludicrous demands, Harvard fought back hard. It filed a lawsuit, with help from a legal team that included conservative litigators, and became a national symbol of resistance to his lawlessness. Mr. Garber made Harvard look reasonable and Mr. Trump unreasonable."

You need to trace its roots in the 1960s, its evolution through the culture wars of the 1980s and ’90s, and into the current populist fray. Then you need to do something about it. Professors, administrators, students, and concerned citizens can no longer stand on the sidelines, shaking our heads and deploring the potentially devastating consequences. The simple truth is this: For decades, outside forces have — both consciously and unintentionally — undermined the integrity and quality of public higher education in America. And time and time again, a divided academic community has failed to combat them effectively. We can and must do better. Seeds of resistance are sprouting. Together, we must nurture their growth. There is no time to lose.\n\n(Though it was written in 2022, this is an excellent historic overview beginning with Reagan’s rise on the backs of student protestors at UC Berkeley.)"

Allow Ed Tech to offer more predatory degrees, then allow more admin friendly accreditors, then go after existing accreditors?)\n\n“As an accreditor with institutions that have been stalled in the process, this guidance will have a positive impact on the work we have been doing with several institutions. We look forward to helping our institutions understand what this may mean for them and for us,” MSCHE president Heather Perfetti wrote. “We appreciate that there are well-defined restrictions that will not allow for institutions to change accreditors to avoid accountability with an existing accreditor.”\n\n\nAre You Ready for the AI University?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/are-you-ready-for-the-ai-university\n\nIn the movie Blade Runner 2049, one of the characters (coincidentally an AI humanoid) says about the rise of AI: “You can’t hold the tide back with a broom.” We are at a tidal moment.\n\n\nColleges have traditionally relied on economies of scale to maintain their bottom lines. With labs, dormitories, lecture halls, athletic facilities, and so much else, colleges have exorbitant fixed costs. Those fixed costs have typically been covered in large part by student enrollment. Now that enrollment is declining, higher education’s cost curve is breaking. No amount of cutting will fix the underlying problem. Many colleges have masked their operating deficiencies by using Covid-relief funds in the past few years, but now, with those funds exhausted, they are dealing with a broken economic model. The Trump administration’s cuts to research funding are adding additional stress to colleges’ already precarious cost structure.\n\n\nMore damaging than the cost curve is the shift in how students view the value of higher education. Having grown up with Amazon, Netflix, and Google, students expect a speedy, on-demand, and low-friction experience. Moreover, they increasingly view college through a transactional lens: They pursue a degree to get a job. So they regard college much like any other consumer product, and like those other products, they expect it to be delivered how they want, when they want. Why wouldn’t they?\n\nI’d quote the next line, but it ends with “AI is going to decimate faculty ranks”… But I will quote this one:\n\nThe big mistake faculty members make is underestimating the existential threat AI represents to their livelihoods.\n\n\nIs Your Online Student a Bot?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/is-your-online-student-a-bot\n(Following an article K had shared earlier)"

The report said that bias incidents had been occurring before the Hamas attack and were intensified by the war in Gaza. It found that antisemitism seemed to be more pronounced in branches of the university with a social justice bent, including the graduate school of education, the divinity school and the school of public health.\n\n\nA similar task force held hundreds of conversations with Muslim, Arab and Palestinian students, staff and faculty members about anti-Muslim bias.

The university’s president, James E. Ryan, said the move signaled that “becoming a more diverse, equitable place is both the right and the smart thing to do.”\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the board voted unanimously to rescind any such numerical goals as part of a sweeping effort to wipe out evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The Trump administration had warned university officials, only the day before, that it had received complaints that the university wasn’t acting fast enough to carry through on its promise to “dismantle DEI apparatuses.”\n\n\nIn its letter on Monday, the Justice Department said the president had failed to produce a sufficiently detailed progress report. (A campus spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about whether the required report had been submitted.) It demanded that Ryan and Hardie certify by Friday that the vestiges of DEI have been removed from every division, department, program, and school.\n\n\nThe Board of Visitors deliberated during a closed session on Tuesday. The public portion of the meeting was not live-streamed. It’s unclear whether the board brought up the fact that Ryan, who became president in 2018, was one of more than 550 higher-education leaders who signed a statement circulated by the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) that condemned “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe.\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate was concerned enough about the board’s reaction that on Monday, it passed a resolution supporting Ryan and his decision to sign the AAC&U statement, saying it “expresses principles that are essential to upholding UVA’s mission, reputation, and operations.”\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate had encouraged Ryan to collaborate with other university presidents to promote higher education’s contributions to the nation. Ryan’s signature, it said, reaffirmed the university’s established policies on institutional statements and free expression. The former discourages the university from commenting on social or political issues “unless the matter directly affects the university’s mission or operations.”\n\n\nTrump’s 100-Day War on Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/30/how-trumps-first-100-days-transformed-higher-ed\n10 things done such as “Pursuing Punishment as Policy” and “Breeding Financial Uncertainty” and “Tanking America’s Global Stature”.

Schneider, a German scholar who has worked for C.E.U. for more than 20 years and will become its interim president and rector in August.\n\n\n“These demands, these requirements, they are a scale of detail that Orban never bothered with,” Tim Crane, a Britain-born philosophy professor, said at C.E.U.\n\n\n“Universities and their allies need to speak up in defense of core values,” she [Amy Gutmann, a political scientist who led the University of Pennsylvania for nearly 18 years and then served as President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s ambassador to Germany] said, adding that “the C.E.U. experience warns against the instinct to make concessions to an administration that’s intent on punishing the political opposition.”\n\n\nIn Mr. Orban’s Hungary, sometimes described as a “propaganda state,” the government transferred control of public universities to foundations — controlled by the ruling party’s allies — and gender studies essentially became a forbidden academic discipline.\n\n\nIn 2017, the Hungarian government, which some prominent figures on the American right have praised, stepped up its effort to undermine the American-accredited university. The campaign was built on legal maneuvering, including a hastily passed law, struck down years later by the European Court of Justice, effectively requiring C.E.U. to open a new campus in the United States.\n\n\nThe university tried to negotiate, but talks with the Hungarian government failed in late 2018. Thousands of Hungarians protested the government’s tactics that year — “Even Voldemort didn’t kick Hogwarts out,” read one sign — but C.E.U. said it had no choice but to leave.\n\n\nEva Kiser, a museum studies student at C.E.U. who is from Knoxville, Tenn., said she had been counting on political firewalls in the United States to hold and that things would “blow over.”\n\n\n“But that’s not really looking probable,” she said.\n\n\n“Don’t expect mercy, or that this is normal and you need to sort of be nice and then they come to their senses,” Dr. Schneider, the incoming interim rector, said. “It is unhinged. …”\n\n\nBorrowing an idea from the economist Albert O. Hirschman, Professor Dorsch, an American, said universities had three options: leave, obey the government or speak up.\n\n(Lots of salient quotes here, an article well worth reading, as the mafia state has learned some things from the propaganda state.)\n\nNotes from an Occupation\n\nhttps://www.nybooks.com/articles/2025/06/26/notes-from-an-occupation-marilynne-robinson/\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nA well-planned occupation seizes the heights of the defeated civilization, so that the people will see their leaders ousted or humiliated and made docile. It will likewise discredit and weaken those features of the culture in which its people placed confidence and pride. If this model were applied to our situation, we might expect to see the Supreme Court diminished, the Congress disempowered, and the Constitution desacralized by indifference or contempt. The press would come under attack. Our incomparable universities and research institutions would lose autonomy and resources. The mighty dollar would be weakened. Bonds with allies would be breached, and the occupied country would be held in contempt for the damage its default had done to the world order, and to democracy, having put aside its responsibility for demonstrating the viability of popular government.\n\n\nExamples of the seizing of cultural heights abound. In 70 AD the Romans utterly razed the Temple at Jerusalem and Jerusalem itself in order to deal with the Jewish population’s resistance to their oppression. In 1814 the British, still wanting to break the back of the Revolution, burned the American Capitol Building, destroying the Library of Congress.\n\n\nI am proposing, of course, that America actually is, at present, an occupied country. I will call the occupiers Red and the occupied Blue, since these colors are in general use for distinctions of this kind and seemingly cause no offense.\n\n(More behind a paywall, I’m sure)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: We Watched Dozens of Graduation Speeches.

Those foreign scholars were also supposed to receive acceptance letters around April.\n\n\nThe board is also concerned that the budget that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is requesting from Congress for the next fiscal year cuts spending for the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, which includes the Fulbright program, to $50 million from $691 million this fiscal year.\n\n\n“The bipartisan Fulbright Board was mandated by Congress to be a check on the executive and to ensure that students, researchers and educators are not subjected to the blatant political favoritism that this administration is known for,” Ms. Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.\n\n\n“While I understand and respect the bipartisan Fulbright Board for resigning en masse rather than grant credibility to a politicized and unlawful process,” she added, “I am painfully aware that today’s move will change the quality of Fulbright programming and the independent research that has made our country a leader in so many fields.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColleges Can’t Trust the Federal Government. What Now?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/colleges-cant-trust-the-federal-government-what-now\n\nSupport from the federal government has been so consistent and made such good sense that colleges and universities have built their budgets, infrastructure, and programming around the assumption of its permanence. Trump 2.0 has shown what happens when the government does not behave sensibly and has turned an essential lifeline into an existential risk.\n\n\nThe scorched-earth assault on Harvard University is generating all the headlines, but it might in fact be drawing attention away from an even larger story: the tectonic shift in the future activities and financial underpinnings of American higher education and the even greater risk to institutions that have neither Harvard’s resources nor Harvard’s reputation.\n\n\nEven if universities manage to muddle through Trump’s vindictive irrationality, can they return to building budget models that assume consistently high levels of federal support? JD Vance is waiting in the wings, and who knows what new Trumps and Vances the future might bring?\n\n\nA small group of the most prestigious and selective universities might be able to substitute affluent domestic students for affluent international students at the undergraduate level, though even those institutions would likely have trouble doing so for master’s-degree programs, where costs are high and return on investment can be questionable. For most colleges, such a substitution would be impossible and tuition revenue would necessarily decline. Subtract the full-paying international students from the applicant pool and an already fragile financial structure would begin very quickly to collapse.\n\n\nFor the ideologues driving the administration’s policies on education and immigration — Linda McMahon and Kristi Noem are not the brains behind this operation — the destructive effects of these various policies are very much the point. None of the consequences we are seeing are unintended.\n\n\nDevastating scientific research and systematically undermining the preeminence of American universities — like so many of the actions of the Trump administration — represents a triumph of vindictiveness and nihilism over sound public policy. But here we are, about to see how quickly and adroitly the embattled and change-resistant world of higher education can adapt to a future in which the government cannot be trusted.\n\n\n\n\n\nCiting Ohio’s SB 1, College Refuses to Sign Union Contract\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/labor-unionization/2025/06/12/citing-ohios-sb-1-college-refuses-sign-union\n\nUnited Faculty of Central Ohio Technical College union members and their institution are both citing state law in a dispute over whether the institution must sign a new collective bargaining agreement—or gut provisions it agreed to earlier in order to comply with the state’s sweeping new public higher education law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Texas, University Presidents May Soon Control Faculty Senates\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/06/09/texas-presidents-may-soon-control-faculty-senates\n\nA bill awaiting Gov. Abbott’s signature would require college administrators to set procedures for faculty governing bodies and appoint their leaders, part of an effort to address “liberal faculty control over universities.”\n\n\n“Shared governance structures may not be used to obstruct, delay, or undermine necessary institutional reforms or serve as a mechanism for advancing ideological or political agendas,” says Senate Bill 37, which the Republican-dominated State Legislature passed May 31. Multiple states have considered GOP bills targeting shared governance, but SB 37 is a sweeping example.\n\n\nIf a college or university board decides to keep a faculty governing body, the institution’s president gets to prescribe how it conducts meetings. The president also gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary.”\n\n\nIn addition, unless the college or university’s board decides otherwise, faculty senates and councils must shrink to no more than 60 members.\n\n\nIn another blow to faculty control of their own governance bodies, SB 37 establishes term limits for faculty senate and council members—and allows presidential appointees to serve longer than the elected members.\n\n(Two years, then a two year break)\n\nA faculty senate or council member could also have their seat stripped at any time; the bill says the provost can recommend to the president that members be “immediately removed” for failing to attend meetings or conduct their “responsibilities within the council’s or senate’s parameters” or for “similar misconduct.”\n\n(Will this be a national template if Abbott signs this bill? The reporting attributes the bill to one legislator, but I doubt their office drafted it.)\n\nTrump Ends Vital Higher Ed Data System Training\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/09/department-education-discontinues-ipeds-training\n\nUsed to track trends in higher education enrollment, completion, financial aid usage and other institutional characteristics, IPEDS survey data has long been critical to higher education research. But in order to access and utilize the data, institutions need to know how to properly complete the survey and researchers need to know how to navigate the database.\n\n\nProject 2025 Author to Work at Education Department\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/09/project-2025-author-work-education-department\n\nThe Trump administration announced Friday that Lindsey Burke, the director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation, will be the department’s deputy chief of staff for policy and programs. Burke also authored the Education Department chapter of Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint that called for sweeping changes to higher education policy, from privatizing student loans to rolling back LGBTQ+ protections in Title IX.\n\n\nExclusive | Leaders of CUNY, other college antisemitism hotbeds to be grilled by House panel next month\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2025/06/09/us-news/leaders-of-cuny-other-college-antisemitism-hotbeds-to-be-grilled-by-house-panel-next-month/\n(No need to click through.

Both would cap graduate loans, open up the Pell Grant program to short-term programs and cut all but one option for income-driven loan repayment.\n\n\nMost notably, the Senate bill does not include a limit on traditional Pell Grant eligibility that would have excluded thousands of part-time students, as the House version did, and it walks back the House’s controversial risk-sharing plan, which would force colleges to pay a penalty based on students’ unpaid loans.\n\n\nRepublicans are keen on college sports legislation.

Now Trump May Force Him Out.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/07/us/trump-harvard-international-student-ban.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFive weeks later, just after the end of the spring semester, Mr. Williamson [rom Wales], now at a summer abroad program, picked up his phone and saw a pileup of missed calls and messages. The threat his friends had dismissed had become a searing reality: The federal government had effectively blocked Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students — abruptly thrusting Mr. Williamson and others into an excruciating limbo.\n\n\nHe had arrived in Cambridge, Mass., intent on studying physics, drawn to its broad range of useful applications in other sciences. Then, during his first semester, he found a new passion — in a politics course taught by Steven Levitsky, the author of the best-selling book “How Democracies Die,” that featured a deep dive into authoritarianism. After that, Mr. Williamson planned to become a double major in physics and government. Maybe someday, he thought, he would make his own foray into politics or public service.\n\n\n“It was the best year of my life,” he said.\n\n\nIn recent weeks, long-simmering Republican anger over Harvard’s links to China has increasingly gained traction\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/world/china/harvards-china-ties-become-new-front-in-battle-with-trump-6eb24947?st=D2uR9P&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(There is always something to stir up republican anger…)\n\nTrump indicated that his concern about the Xinjiang corps was based on findings of a House Select Committee on China. Its chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar (R., Mich.), late last month wrote to Harvard President Alan Garber, demanding explanations about university activities that “create risks to U.S. national security and further the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) genocide in Xinjiang.”\n\n\nIn Public, Harvard Is Fighting Trump. Quietly, It’s Dismantling a Program the White House Doesn’t Like.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/in-public-harvard-is-fighting-trump-quietly-its-dismantling-a-program-the-white-house-doesnt-like\n\nHarvard University has spent the last year slowly dismantling a religious-studies program that critics said was biased against Israel, five current and former university employees told The Chronicle. Last week, the final hammer fell: The five remaining staff members employed by the Religion and Public Life program were called, one by one, into meetings with a representative from Harvard’s human-resources department and the program’s interim director, David F. Holland. There, all learned their contracts would not be renewed.\n\n\nThe program puts out a “wide range” of events and courses, McKanan said. But since the October 7 attacks, the program’s teaching around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has drawn criticism from those who argue Harvard’s campus is a hotbed of antisemitism.\n\n\nIn an internal report on antisemitism published in April, a task force of professors, students, and advisers had suggested that a lack of rigor among “nonladder” faculty at Harvard was partly to blame for programs and events that task-force members characterized as antisemitic. The task force recommended tenured Harvard faculty members exercise greater oversight of programs.\n\n\nNonladder — or non-tenure-track — faculty deliver about half of the curriculum at the Divinity School, said McKanan, who has a nonladder contract and has been at Harvard for 17 years. “When Harvard chooses to rely on nonladder faculty,” he said, “it becomes a little bit strange and unnatural to exclude that half of the faculty from program leadership and from sponsoring public events on issues of urgent public concern.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Rubio Is Pressing to Open Sanctions Investigation Into Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/politics/rubio-is-pressing-to-open-sanctions-investigation-into-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(More weaponization of the federal government, err “Trump administration’s whole-of-government approach to bringing the Ivy League university to heel.”)\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is pushing to investigate whether Harvard University violated federal sanctions by collaborating on a health insurance conference in China that may have included officials blacklisted by the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The New York Times.\n\n\nMr. Trump and his allies appear determined [hell-bent] to upend nearly all aspects of the institution, which has long symbolized the pinnacle of higher learning in the country and attracted influential scholars from around the globe.\n\n(And here we see the fingerprints of the Manhattan Institute)\n\nStill, the X.P.C.C.’s involvement in the conference only recently gained attention from Trump allies, after a report about Harvard’s links to China published on April 22 by Strategy Risks, a New York-based intelligence company specializing in corporate exposure to China. The report was funded by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank that has advised Republican policymakers.\n\n\nNYTimes: What Happens if ‘Harvard Is Not Harvard’?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/harvard-funding-trump-administration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n“Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” school officials wrote in a lawsuit asking a judge to stop the federal government’s actions.\n\n\nIt left unsaid what Harvard, if it were no longer Harvard, would become.\n\n\nBut without federal dollars or international talent, experts say, Harvard could fall out of the top tier for research, where it currently sits with competitors like Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. By sheer dollars spent, its research budget could shrink to something similar to that of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, which spent just over $800 million on research in 2023, roughly half of what Harvard spends now.\n\n\nHarvard could choose to negotiate. But inside the university, officials appear reluctant to do that, given the backlash they could face for capitulating to Mr. Trump. This spring, the university took out $750 million in debt, giving it some cash flow as court decisions play out.\n\n\nThe atmosphere is particularly tense inside the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which relies on federal funding for 46 percent of its budget and has a student body that is about 40 percent international. Senior officials there are planning for the worst, and have called the potential changes an “existential crisis” for the school’s future.\n\n\nBut Harvard’s biggest source of funding is donations and payouts from its endowment, which together make up 45 percent of its revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Indiana U., Professors Spar With Administrators Over Nighttime Protests\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/at-indiana-u-professors-spar-with-administrators-over-nighttime-protests\n\nUnder a policy passed in response to a monthslong pro-Palestinian encampment at Indiana, certain forms of “expressive activity” — including holding protests, making speeches, and circulating petitions — were banned on campus between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Administrators argued that the changes were necessary to ensure safety after the encampment got out of hand.\n\n\nThe policy banned protests between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., required 10-day prior approval for installing “structures and/or mass physical objects,” and pushed protests 25 feet away from building entrances.\n\n\nStudents and staff sued over the policy. In late May, a federal judge temporarily blocked the nighttime restrictions.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the political climate surrounding the university remains contentious. Last week, Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, removed the three alumni-elected trustees from Indiana’s board — including two who voted against the expressive-activity policy — and replaced them with conservatives, including a prominent lawyer and a former ESPN anchor.\n\n\nTexas lawmakers just approved legislation broadly banning “any speech or expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment” between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. at public universities. The measure now awaits the governor’s signature.\n\n\nBut Indiana’s expressive-activity policy never specified how many nighttime protesters were too many. That meant even a protest involving two people — unlikely to be a threat to public safety — would require prior approval, the judge said in her order granting the preliminary injunction.\n\n\nWhile the decision was far from “novel or surprising,” it will hopefully send a message to universities imposing similar policies that “the courts are not going to put up with this kind of similarly open violation of the First Amendment and so they probably shouldn’t try it,” said Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the George Washington University Law School.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Administration Proposes Cutting Tribal College Funds by Nearly 90% — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/tribal-colleges-universities-trump-cuts-funding\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed cutting funding for tribal colleges and universities by nearly 90%, a move that would likely shut down most or all of the institutions created to serve students disadvantaged by the nation’s historic mistreatment of Indigenous communities.\n\n\nThe document mentions only the two federally controlled tribal colleges — Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute — but notes the request for postsecondary programs will drop from more than $182 million this year to just over $22 million for 2026.\n\n\nInside UNC’s Effort to Launch a New Accreditor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/accreditation/2025/06/06/emails-shed-light-uncs-plans-create-new-accreditor\n\nLast month, Peter Hans, president of the University of North Carolina system, casually dropped a bombshell announcement that the system and others were in talks to launch a new accreditor.\n\n\n“We’ve been having a number of discussions with several other major public university systems, where we’re exploring the idea of creating an accreditor that would offer sound oversight,” Hans said at a UNC system Board of Governors meeting last month, The News & Observer reported.\n\n\nhave been quietly engaged in conversations about launching a new accreditor for at least a year, including discussions with unnamed collaborators in Florida, where the effort could be headquartered. UNC officials have also spoken with officials at the U.S. Department of Education, even getting a heads-up on what an April 23 executive order from the Trump administration on accreditation would entail.\n\n\n“Everything Florida has done on accreditation over the past few years appears to be politically and ideologically driven, rather than about what is best for students and ensuring that they go to high-quality institutions and get a good education when they’re paying a lot of money for it and when taxpayers are investing a lot of money in public funding for higher education,” he said [Edward Conroy, a senior policy manager at the left-leaning think tank New America].\n\n\nConroy worries that state lawmakers in either Florida or North Carolina would require public colleges in their state to be accredited by their new accreditor. That would undermine the current requirement that colleges get to choose their own accreditor.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard, Duke, Stanford and other wealthy universities are hoping to avoid a huge potential tax hike by pitching an alternative plan to Congress: a pledge to spend more of their own money\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/colleges-hope-to-stave-off-big-tax-hike-by-pledging-to-spend-more-endowment-cash-353606fb?st=FTbBSQ&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(They will spend 5% of their endowments.

He should increase it.\n\n(He doesn’t, ed.)\n\nIf the United States wants to compete with other countries for manufacturing jobs, our best strategy is to leverage our exceptional university research capabilities to rebuild our manufacturing base.\n\n\nUniversities have long played pivotal roles in building world-class high-tech economies: Stanford University helped make Silicon Valley what it is today by fostering technological excellence in electrical engineering, establishing the Stanford Research Park and educating the founders of startups like Hewlett-Packard. Individuals from universities like M.I.T. and Harvard played central roles in transforming Boston from a center of textile and boot and shoe manufacturing to a health-sciences hub by starting the world’s first modern venture capital fund to commercialize academic research.\n\n\nCarnegie Mellon University helped revitalize Pittsburgh through targeted investments in computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics, coupled with strategic initiatives to bolster local entrepreneurship. The University of Texas at Austin mobilized local business and political leaders to transform Austin into a leading high-tech region. In all of these cases, universities led efforts to reposition their regional economies toward high-tech sectors such as computers, software, biotechnology and robotics.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump preparing large-scale cancellation of federal funding for California, sources say | CNN Politics\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/06/06/politics/trump-california-federal-funding\n(Could just be a feint, but…)\n\nJust last month, he threatened to withhold federal funding from California over a transgender athlete’s participation in a sporting event — the latest example of the president trying to use funding as leverage to enact his agenda. The administration recently cut $126.4 million in flood prevention funding projects, and Trump repeatedly went after the state’s handling of devastating wildfires earlier this year. The president and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have also publicly feuded for years.\n\n\nHigher education in the state could be hit hard by Trump’s move. GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California, who said he was unaware of the imminent grant cancellations, told CNN he recently met with university representatives who were concerned about the future of their funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the AI Tool Used by DOGE to Review Veterans Affairs Contracts — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/inside-ai-tool-doge-veterans-affairs-contracts-sahil-lavingia\n(Interesting take down of the engineered AI prompts used for this particular smash-and-grab)\n\nNYTimes: Welcome to Campus.

It is also running marketing campaigns aimed at getting students who have never used chatbots to try ChatGPT.\n\n\nOpenAI’s campaign is part of an escalating A.I. arms race among tech giants to win over universities and students with their chatbots. The company is following in the footsteps of rivals like Google and Microsoft that have for years pushed to get their computers and software into schools, and court students as future customers.\n\n(Big tech’s continued attempts to wrest control of education from the professoriate)\n\nOpenAI’s push to A.I.-ify college education amounts to a national experiment on millions of students. The use of these chatbots in schools is so new that their potential long-term educational benefits, and possible side effects, are not yet established.\n\n\nA few early studies have found that outsourcing tasks like research and writing to chatbots can diminish skills like critical thinking.

Vehicles transporting the test papers — classified as state secrets — are equipped with video surveillance. Copies of the test are stored in steel-reinforced rooms that can only be opened by three people, each wielding their own key. China made cheating on exams a criminal act in 2015 — punishable in some cases by prison sentences.\n\n\nThis year, AI companies joined in, adding a new layer to the ring of walls and moats around the exam.\n\n\nChinese AI model DeepSeek did not allow users to upload photos of test papers during the same period….AI tool Kimi allowed photo recognition on Tuesday, but uploading failed when it detected a test exam or paper. Doubao, the AI app owned by TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, appeared to suspend the uploading of test paper photos or screenshots, though other photos worked fine.\n\n\nThis year, some schools in China used real-time AI patrol and surveillance systems to check for suspicious behavior in the exam room: whispering, peeking, passing objects, answering early or using prohibited tools, Chinese state media outlets reported. It can detect the behavior during the exam and with a “post-exam intelligent search,” a Global Times article said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

    "text": "NYTimes: Harvard’s Battle Is Familiar to a University the Right Forced into Exile\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/08/us/trump-harvard-hungary-orban-george-soros.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAs the Trump administration escalates its pressure campaign, more people in American higher education — and in Vienna — believe the U.S. government is borrowing from a playbook refined in recent years by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who used state power to menace a university he disdained, upend academic independence and strengthen his ideological grip on Hungary.\n\n\n“At the abstract level, it’s the same,” said Carsten Q. Schneider, a German scholar who has worked for C.E.U. for more than 20 years and will become its interim president and rector in August.\n\n\n“These demands, these requirements, they are a scale of detail that Orban never bothered with,” Tim Crane, a Britain-born philosophy professor, said at C.E.U.\n\n\n“Universities and their allies need to speak up in defense of core values,” she [Amy Gutmann, a political scientist who led the University of Pennsylvania for nearly 18 years and then served as President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s ambassador to Germany] said, adding that “the C.E.U. experience warns against the instinct to make concessions to an administration that’s intent on punishing the political opposition.”\n\n\nIn Mr. Orban’s Hungary, sometimes described as a “propaganda state,” the government transferred control of public universities to foundations — controlled by the ruling party’s allies — and gender studies essentially became a forbidden academic discipline.\n\n\nIn 2017, the Hungarian government, which some prominent figures on the American right have praised, stepped up its effort to undermine the American-accredited university. The campaign was built on legal maneuvering, including a hastily passed law, struck down years later by the European Court of Justice, effectively requiring C.E.U. to open a new campus in the United States.\n\n\nThe university tried to negotiate, but talks with the Hungarian government failed in late 2018. Thousands of Hungarians protested the government’s tactics that year — “Even Voldemort didn’t kick Hogwarts out,” read one sign — but C.E.U. said it had no choice but to leave.\n\n\nEva Kiser, a museum studies student at C.E.U. who is from Knoxville, Tenn., said she had been counting on political firewalls in the United States to hold and that things would “blow over.”\n\n\n“But that’s not really looking probable,” she said.\n\n\n“Don’t expect mercy, or that this is normal and you need to sort of be nice and then they come to their senses,” Dr. Schneider, the incoming interim rector, said. “It is unhinged. …”\n\n\nBorrowing an idea from the economist Albert O. Hirschman, Professor Dorsch, an American, said universities had three options: leave, obey the government or speak up.\n\n(Lots of salient quotes here, an article well worth reading, as the mafia state has learned some things from the propaganda state.)\n\nNotes from an Occupation\n\nhttps://www.nybooks.com/articles/2025/06/26/notes-from-an-occupation-marilynne-robinson/\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nA well-planned occupation seizes the heights of the defeated civilization, so that the people will see their leaders ousted or humiliated and made docile. It will likewise discredit and weaken those features of the culture in which its people placed confidence and pride. If this model were applied to our situation, we might expect to see the Supreme Court diminished, the Congress disempowered, and the Constitution desacralized by indifference or contempt. The press would come under attack. Our incomparable universities and research institutions would lose autonomy and resources. The mighty dollar would be weakened. Bonds with allies would be breached, and the occupied country would be held in contempt for the damage its default had done to the world order, and to democracy, having put aside its responsibility for demonstrating the viability of popular government.\n\n\nExamples of the seizing of cultural heights abound. In 70 AD the Romans utterly razed the Temple at Jerusalem and Jerusalem itself in order to deal with the Jewish population’s resistance to their oppression. In 1814 the British, still wanting to break the back of the Revolution, burned the American Capitol Building, destroying the Library of Congress.\n\n\nI am proposing, of course, that America actually is, at present, an occupied country. I will call the occupiers Red and the occupied Blue, since these colors are in general use for distinctions of this kind and seemingly cause no offense.\n\n(More behind a paywall, I’m sure)",

Some of the groups involved include OEDP, the Data Rescue Project, Safeguarding Research and Culture, the Internet Archive, the End of Term Archive, and the Data.gov Archive, which is run by the Harvard Law School Library.\n\n\n… “That took time,” Richards said, noting that not every data set and its accompanying metadata was easy to replicate. “Each varied significantly.

What Now?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/colleges-cant-trust-the-federal-government-what-now\n\nSupport from the federal government has been so consistent and made such good sense that colleges and universities have built their budgets, infrastructure, and programming around the assumption of its permanence. Trump 2.0 has shown what happens when the government does not behave sensibly and has turned an essential lifeline into an existential risk.\n\n\nThe scorched-earth assault on Harvard University is generating all the headlines, but it might in fact be drawing attention away from an even larger story: the tectonic shift in the future activities and financial underpinnings of American higher education and the even greater risk to institutions that have neither Harvard’s resources nor Harvard’s reputation.\n\n\nEven if universities manage to muddle through Trump’s vindictive irrationality, can they return to building budget models that assume consistently high levels of federal support? JD Vance is waiting in the wings, and who knows what new Trumps and Vances the future might bring?\n\n\nA small group of the most prestigious and selective universities might be able to substitute affluent domestic students for affluent international students at the undergraduate level, though even those institutions would likely have trouble doing so for master’s-degree programs, where costs are high and return on investment can be questionable. For most colleges, such a substitution would be impossible and tuition revenue would necessarily decline. Subtract the full-paying international students from the applicant pool and an already fragile financial structure would begin very quickly to collapse.\n\n\nFor the ideologues driving the administration’s policies on education and immigration — Linda McMahon and Kristi Noem are not the brains behind this operation — the destructive effects of these various policies are very much the point. None of the consequences we are seeing are unintended.\n\n\nDevastating scientific research and systematically undermining the preeminence of American universities — like so many of the actions of the Trump administration — represents a triumph of vindictiveness and nihilism over sound public policy. But here we are, about to see how quickly and adroitly the embattled and change-resistant world of higher education can adapt to a future in which the government cannot be trusted.\n\n\n\n\n\nCiting Ohio’s SB 1, College Refuses to Sign Union Contract\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/labor-unionization/2025/06/12/citing-ohios-sb-1-college-refuses-sign-union\n\nUnited Faculty of Central Ohio Technical College union members and their institution are both citing state law in a dispute over whether the institution must sign a new collective bargaining agreement—or gut provisions it agreed to earlier in order to comply with the state’s sweeping new public higher education law.",

Multiple states have considered GOP bills targeting shared governance, but SB 37 is a sweeping example.\n\n\nIf a college or university board decides to keep a faculty governing body, the institution’s president gets to prescribe how it conducts meetings. The president also gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary.”\n\n\nIn addition, unless the college or university’s board decides otherwise, faculty senates and councils must shrink to no more than 60 members.\n\n\nIn another blow to faculty control of their own governance bodies, SB 37 establishes term limits for faculty senate and council members—and allows presidential appointees to serve longer than the elected members.\n\n(Two years, then a two year break)\n\nA faculty senate or council member could also have their seat stripped at any time; the bill says the provost can recommend to the president that members be “immediately removed” for failing to attend meetings or conduct their “responsibilities within the council’s or senate’s parameters” or for “similar misconduct.”\n\n(Will this be a national template if Abbott signs this bill? The reporting attributes the bill to one legislator, but I doubt their office drafted it.)\n\nTrump Ends Vital Higher Ed Data System Training\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/09/department-education-discontinues-ipeds-training\n\nUsed to track trends in higher education enrollment, completion, financial aid usage and other institutional characteristics, IPEDS survey data has long been critical to higher education research. But in order to access and utilize the data, institutions need to know how to properly complete the survey and researchers need to know how to navigate the database.\n\n\nProject 2025 Author to Work at Education Department\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/09/project-2025-author-work-education-department\n\nThe Trump administration announced Friday that Lindsey Burke, the director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation, will be the department’s deputy chief of staff for policy and programs. Burke also authored the Education Department chapter of Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint that called for sweeping changes to higher education policy, from privatizing student loans to rolling back LGBTQ+ protections in Title IX.\n\n\nExclusive | Leaders of CUNY, other college antisemitism hotbeds to be grilled by House panel next month\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2025/06/09/us-news/leaders-of-cuny-other-college-antisemitism-hotbeds-to-be-grilled-by-house-panel-next-month/\n(No need to click through.

Both would cap graduate loans, open up the Pell Grant program to short-term programs and cut all but one option for income-driven loan repayment.\n\n\nMost notably, the Senate bill does not include a limit on traditional Pell Grant eligibility that would have excluded thousands of part-time students, as the House version did, and it walks back the House’s controversial risk-sharing plan, which would force colleges to pay a penalty based on students’ unpaid loans.\n\n\nRepublicans are keen on college sports legislation.

Now Trump May Force Him Out.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/07/us/trump-harvard-international-student-ban.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFive weeks later, just after the end of the spring semester, Mr. Williamson [rom Wales], now at a summer abroad program, picked up his phone and saw a pileup of missed calls and messages. The threat his friends had dismissed had become a searing reality: The federal government had effectively blocked Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students — abruptly thrusting Mr. Williamson and others into an excruciating limbo.\n\n\nHe had arrived in Cambridge, Mass., intent on studying physics, drawn to its broad range of useful applications in other sciences. Then, during his first semester, he found a new passion — in a politics course taught by Steven Levitsky, the author of the best-selling book “How Democracies Die,” that featured a deep dive into authoritarianism. After that, Mr. Williamson planned to become a double major in physics and government. Maybe someday, he thought, he would make his own foray into politics or public service.\n\n\n“It was the best year of my life,” he said.\n\n\nIn recent weeks, long-simmering Republican anger over Harvard’s links to China has increasingly gained traction\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/world/china/harvards-china-ties-become-new-front-in-battle-with-trump-6eb24947?st=D2uR9P&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(There is always something to stir up republican anger…)\n\nTrump indicated that his concern about the Xinjiang corps was based on findings of a House Select Committee on China. Its chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar (R., Mich.), late last month wrote to Harvard President Alan Garber, demanding explanations about university activities that “create risks to U.S. national security and further the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) genocide in Xinjiang.”\n\n\nIn Public, Harvard Is Fighting Trump. Quietly, It’s Dismantling a Program the White House Doesn’t Like.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/in-public-harvard-is-fighting-trump-quietly-its-dismantling-a-program-the-white-house-doesnt-like\n\nHarvard University has spent the last year slowly dismantling a religious-studies program that critics said was biased against Israel, five current and former university employees told The Chronicle. Last week, the final hammer fell: The five remaining staff members employed by the Religion and Public Life program were called, one by one, into meetings with a representative from Harvard’s human-resources department and the program’s interim director, David F. Holland. There, all learned their contracts would not be renewed.\n\n\nThe program puts out a “wide range” of events and courses, McKanan said. But since the October 7 attacks, the program’s teaching around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has drawn criticism from those who argue Harvard’s campus is a hotbed of antisemitism.\n\n\nIn an internal report on antisemitism published in April, a task force of professors, students, and advisers had suggested that a lack of rigor among “nonladder” faculty at Harvard was partly to blame for programs and events that task-force members characterized as antisemitic. The task force recommended tenured Harvard faculty members exercise greater oversight of programs.\n\n\nNonladder — or non-tenure-track — faculty deliver about half of the curriculum at the Divinity School, said McKanan, who has a nonladder contract and has been at Harvard for 17 years. “When Harvard chooses to rely on nonladder faculty,” he said, “it becomes a little bit strange and unnatural to exclude that half of the faculty from program leadership and from sponsoring public events on issues of urgent public concern.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Rubio Is Pressing to Open Sanctions Investigation Into Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/politics/rubio-is-pressing-to-open-sanctions-investigation-into-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(More weaponization of the federal government, err “Trump administration’s whole-of-government approach to bringing the Ivy League university to heel.”)\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is pushing to investigate whether Harvard University violated federal sanctions by collaborating on a health insurance conference in China that may have included officials blacklisted by the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The New York Times.\n\n\nMr. Trump and his allies appear determined [hell-bent] to upend nearly all aspects of the institution, which has long symbolized the pinnacle of higher learning in the country and attracted influential scholars from around the globe.\n\n(And here we see the fingerprints of the Manhattan Institute)\n\nStill, the X.P.C.C.’s involvement in the conference only recently gained attention from Trump allies, after a report about Harvard’s links to China published on April 22 by Strategy Risks, a New York-based intelligence company specializing in corporate exposure to China. The report was funded by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank that has advised Republican policymakers.\n\n\nNYTimes: What Happens if ‘Harvard Is Not Harvard’?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/harvard-funding-trump-administration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n“Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” school officials wrote in a lawsuit asking a judge to stop the federal government’s actions.\n\n\nIt left unsaid what Harvard, if it were no longer Harvard, would become.\n\n\nBut without federal dollars or international talent, experts say, Harvard could fall out of the top tier for research, where it currently sits with competitors like Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. By sheer dollars spent, its research budget could shrink to something similar to that of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, which spent just over $800 million on research in 2023, roughly half of what Harvard spends now.\n\n\nHarvard could choose to negotiate. But inside the university, officials appear reluctant to do that, given the backlash they could face for capitulating to Mr. Trump. This spring, the university took out $750 million in debt, giving it some cash flow as court decisions play out.\n\n\nThe atmosphere is particularly tense inside the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which relies on federal funding for 46 percent of its budget and has a student body that is about 40 percent international. Senior officials there are planning for the worst, and have called the potential changes an “existential crisis” for the school’s future.\n\n\nBut Harvard’s biggest source of funding is donations and payouts from its endowment, which together make up 45 percent of its revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Indiana U., Professors Spar With Administrators Over Nighttime Protests\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/at-indiana-u-professors-spar-with-administrators-over-nighttime-protests\n\nUnder a policy passed in response to a monthslong pro-Palestinian encampment at Indiana, certain forms of “expressive activity” — including holding protests, making speeches, and circulating petitions — were banned on campus between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Administrators argued that the changes were necessary to ensure safety after the encampment got out of hand.\n\n\nThe policy banned protests between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., required 10-day prior approval for installing “structures and/or mass physical objects,” and pushed protests 25 feet away from building entrances.\n\n\nStudents and staff sued over the policy. In late May, a federal judge temporarily blocked the nighttime restrictions.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the political climate surrounding the university remains contentious. Last week, Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, removed the three alumni-elected trustees from Indiana’s board — including two who voted against the expressive-activity policy — and replaced them with conservatives, including a prominent lawyer and a former ESPN anchor.\n\n\nTexas lawmakers just approved legislation broadly banning “any speech or expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment” between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. at public universities. The measure now awaits the governor’s signature.\n\n\nBut Indiana’s expressive-activity policy never specified how many nighttime protesters were too many. That meant even a protest involving two people — unlikely to be a threat to public safety — would require prior approval, the judge said in her order granting the preliminary injunction.\n\n\nWhile the decision was far from “novel or surprising,” it will hopefully send a message to universities imposing similar policies that “the courts are not going to put up with this kind of similarly open violation of the First Amendment and so they probably shouldn’t try it,” said Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the George Washington University Law School.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Administration Proposes Cutting Tribal College Funds by Nearly 90% — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/tribal-colleges-universities-trump-cuts-funding\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed cutting funding for tribal colleges and universities by nearly 90%, a move that would likely shut down most or all of the institutions created to serve students disadvantaged by the nation’s historic mistreatment of Indigenous communities.\n\n\nThe document mentions only the two federally controlled tribal colleges — Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute — but notes the request for postsecondary programs will drop from more than $182 million this year to just over $22 million for 2026.\n\n\nInside UNC’s Effort to Launch a New Accreditor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/accreditation/2025/06/06/emails-shed-light-uncs-plans-create-new-accreditor\n\nLast month, Peter Hans, president of the University of North Carolina system, casually dropped a bombshell announcement that the system and others were in talks to launch a new accreditor.\n\n\n“We’ve been having a number of discussions with several other major public university systems, where we’re exploring the idea of creating an accreditor that would offer sound oversight,” Hans said at a UNC system Board of Governors meeting last month, The News & Observer reported.\n\n\nhave been quietly engaged in conversations about launching a new accreditor for at least a year, including discussions with unnamed collaborators in Florida, where the effort could be headquartered. UNC officials have also spoken with officials at the U.S. Department of Education, even getting a heads-up on what an April 23 executive order from the Trump administration on accreditation would entail.\n\n\n“Everything Florida has done on accreditation over the past few years appears to be politically and ideologically driven, rather than about what is best for students and ensuring that they go to high-quality institutions and get a good education when they’re paying a lot of money for it and when taxpayers are investing a lot of money in public funding for higher education,” he said [Edward Conroy, a senior policy manager at the left-leaning think tank New America].\n\n\nConroy worries that state lawmakers in either Florida or North Carolina would require public colleges in their state to be accredited by their new accreditor. That would undermine the current requirement that colleges get to choose their own accreditor.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard, Duke, Stanford and other wealthy universities are hoping to avoid a huge potential tax hike by pitching an alternative plan to Congress: a pledge to spend more of their own money\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/colleges-hope-to-stave-off-big-tax-hike-by-pledging-to-spend-more-endowment-cash-353606fb?st=FTbBSQ&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(They will spend 5% of their endowments. At CUNY the cap is 4% and some campuses spend less than this.)",

The number of Americans doing study abroad programs in China peaked at nearly 15,000 in 2011, before plummeting to 211 during the pandemic, when visa restrictions and rippling covid lockdowns made it hard for foreigners to enter the country.\n\n\nU.S. Curb on Chinese Students a Boon for Asian Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/2025/06/10/us-curbs-chinese-students-boon-asian-universities\n\n“We’re not seeing sensationalist headlines in the media, and many families are watching and waiting for the final policy outcome and specific rules from the State Department,” he said. “There is an increasing awareness that the administration’s policies often start with big headlines of assertive nationalist policy, but they often end up being mitigated, reduced or overturned altogether.”\n\n\nHongqing Yang, managing director of the Hong Kong–based consultancy The Educationist, said the Chinese government is likely “to encourage domestic institutions, including those in Hong Kong and Macao, as well as transnational education institutions and joint programs, to accommodate more students” in the wake of the news.\n\n\nIn Hong Kong, the government explicitly encouraged universities to enroll Harvard students following the news.\n\n\nLaurie Pearcey, adviser to the president and college master at the University of Hong Kong Shenzhen, described the situation as a “free kick for Hong Kong.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Red-State Universities Will Get Hit by Trump’s Cuts, Too\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/opinion/trump-harvard-scientific-research.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nRather than striking a blow for red-state America, these cuts would actually take a heavy toll on many of the communities in states that went for Mr. Trump in the last election — whose research universities serve as crucial anchors for industry and innovation.\n\n\nIf Mr. Trump wants to make all of America great again, he shouldn’t cut funding for scientific research. He should increase it.\n\n(He doesn’t, ed.)\n\nIf the United States wants to compete with other countries for manufacturing jobs, our best strategy is to leverage our exceptional university research capabilities to rebuild our manufacturing base.\n\n\nUniversities have long played pivotal roles in building world-class high-tech economies: Stanford University helped make Silicon Valley what it is today by fostering technological excellence in electrical engineering, establishing the Stanford Research Park and educating the founders of startups like Hewlett-Packard. Individuals from universities like M.I.T. and Harvard played central roles in transforming Boston from a center of textile and boot and shoe manufacturing to a health-sciences hub by starting the world’s first modern venture capital fund to commercialize academic research.\n\n\nCarnegie Mellon University helped revitalize Pittsburgh through targeted investments in computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics, coupled with strategic initiatives to bolster local entrepreneurship. The University of Texas at Austin mobilized local business and political leaders to transform Austin into a leading high-tech region. In all of these cases, universities led efforts to reposition their regional economies toward high-tech sectors such as computers, software, biotechnology and robotics.",

Here’s Your ChatGPT.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/07/technology/chatgpt-openai-colleges.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nTo spread chatbots on campuses, OpenAI is selling premium A.I. services to universities for faculty and student use. It is also running marketing campaigns aimed at getting students who have never used chatbots to try ChatGPT.\n\n\nOpenAI’s campaign is part of an escalating A.I. arms race among tech giants to win over universities and students with their chatbots. The company is following in the footsteps of rivals like Google and Microsoft that have for years pushed to get their computers and software into schools, and court students as future customers.\n\n(Big tech’s continued attempts to wrest control of education from the professoriate)\n\nOpenAI’s push to A.I.-ify college education amounts to a national experiment on millions of students. The use of these chatbots in schools is so new that their potential long-term educational benefits, and possible side effects, are not yet established.\n\n\nA few early studies have found that outsourcing tasks like research and writing to chatbots can diminish skills like critical thinking. And some critics argue that colleges going all-in on chatbots are glossing over issues like societal risks, A.I. labor exploitation and environmental costs.\n\n\nChinese AI firms block features amid high-stakes university entrance exams\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/10/china-exam-gaokao-ai-cheating-test/\n\nAs more than 13 million students filed into rooms across China to sit for the notoriously grueling, high-stakes gaokao college entrance exam, they already faced strict anti-cheating and real-time surveillance measures, including facial recognition technology, metal detectors, drones and cellphone-signal blockers. Vehicles transporting the test papers — classified as state secrets — are equipped with video surveillance. Copies of the test are stored in steel-reinforced rooms that can only be opened by three people, each wielding their own key. China made cheating on exams a criminal act in 2015 — punishable in some cases by prison sentences.\n\n\nThis year, AI companies joined in, adding a new layer to the ring of walls and moats around the exam.\n\n\nChinese AI model DeepSeek did not allow users to upload photos of test papers during the same period….AI tool Kimi allowed photo recognition on Tuesday, but uploading failed when it detected a test exam or paper. Doubao, the AI app owned by TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, appeared to suspend the uploading of test paper photos or screenshots, though other photos worked fine.\n\n\nThis year, some schools in China used real-time AI patrol and surveillance systems to check for suspicious behavior in the exam room: whispering, peeking, passing objects, answering early or using prohibited tools, Chinese state media outlets reported. It can detect the behavior during the exam and with a “post-exam intelligent search,” a Global Times article said.",

In the rare areas where the president — or perhaps Elon Musk — may see value in research, the emergent mafia state is almost certain to distribute funds to its friends. One shudders to think what universities would have to do to fit themselves into that category.\n\n\nSo this is my radical proposal for universities: Act like universities, not like businesses. Spend your endowments. Accept more, not fewer students. Open up your campuses and expand your reach not by buying real estate but by bringing education to communities. Create a base.

It is primarily about the acquisition of power — power for its own sake. It is a multifront assault to make the earth a playground for ruthless men, so of course any institutions that might restrain power must be weakened or destroyed. Trumpism is about ego, appetite and acquisitiveness and is driven by a primal aversion to the higher elements of the human spirit — learning, compassion, scientific wonder, the pursuit of justice.\n\n\nThese are not separate battles. This is a single effort to undo the parts of the civilizational order that might restrain Trump’s acquisition of power. And it will take a concerted response to beat it back.\n\n\nSlowly, many of us are realizing that we need to band together. But even these efforts are insular and fragmented.\n\n\nLet’s take the universities. I’ve been privileged to teach at American universities off and on for nearly 30 years and I get to visit a dozen or two others every year. These are the crown jewels of American life. They are hubs of scientific and entrepreneurial innovation. In a million ways, the scholars at universities help us understand ourselves and our world.\n\n\n\n\nHarvard’s President Says the University Will Not Comply With Trump’s Demands\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/harvards-president-says-the-university-will-not-comply-with-trumps-demands\n\nGarber said that the directives violate Harvard’s First Amendment rights, exceed the federal government’s Title VI authority, and threaten the university’s values.\n\n\nThe American Association of University Professors and its chapter at Harvard University sued the Trump administration Friday in an attempt to block the administration’s policy changes and review of nearly $9 billion in federal funding.\n\nhttps://actionnetwork.org/user_files/user_files/000/122/747/original/File_Stamped_Complaint.pdf\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Will Freeze $2 Billion After Harvard Refuses Demands\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/harvard-trump-reject-demands.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nStanford president and provost back Harvard in funding fight\n\nhttps://stanforddaily.com/2025/04/15/levin-martinez-back-harvard-president/\n\nYale too\n\nhttps://thehill.com/homenews/education/5250248-harvard-receives-support-from-yale-stanford/\n\nNYTimes: Why Harvard Decided to Fight Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/why-harvard-resisted-trumps-demands.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n“No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Harvard’s president, Alan M.

This is what the Administration is doing by demanding Harvard accede to “viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\nThe Administration is also overstepping its authority by imposing sweeping conditions on funds that weren’t spelled out by Congress. The Justices held in Cummings (2022) that “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously” to ensure the recipient “voluntarily and knowingly accept[ed] the terms.”\n\n\nWhat Harvard Has Set the Stage For\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/harvard-university-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Thanks EI)\n\nWith these words, Harvard became the first university to officially resist the administration’s abusive intimidation, and it is urgent that it not be the only one. Its actions, supported in recent weeks in statements by other academic leaders, including the presidents of Princeton and Wesleyan, light the way forward on a vital path to fighting President Trump’s war on the independence of higher education.\n\n\nIf universities accept Mr. Trump’s terms, on the other hand, the consequence would be far greater, undermining the very purpose of an independent institution.\n\n\nHarvard Had No Choice\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/harvard-had-no-choice\n\nThus, its decision deserves either praise for courage or condemnation for foolhardiness. I choose praise — in no small part because, as we have already seen with Columbia, capitulation to President Trump’s demands brings only more demands. There’s no point in selling your soul if all you receive in exchange is a worthless IOU.\n\n\nThe anti-intellectual ideologues (no, that’s not an oxymoron) running education policy within and adjacent to the White House do not wish to reform higher education; they want to break it.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: If You’re Boycotting Columbia, Your Priorities Are All Wrong\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/columbia-university-boycott-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThen came the circular firing squad. By mid-April, 2,000 people and more than 75 organizations, most of them faculty groups, had signed onto a boycott of our events, and said they would refuse to work with Columbia scholars, like myself, a vice dean, who hold administrative positions.\n\n\nOne of the main organizers of the boycott, the City University of New York anthropologist Gary Wilder, has struggled to explain this strange form of solidarity.\n\nBut\n\nColumbia would not allow any government to deny professors their rightful role in personnel decisions or to dictate the content of our curricula. Nor would we collaborate with government agents intent on deporting our students and faculty members simply because they exercised their First Amendment rights. At no point did our leadership concede any of these essential principles, which is surely why Columbia has been under Department of Justice investigation “for harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus.”\n\n\nNow that Harvard University has decided to defy the Trump administration, the stage is set for an epic struggle, one that has already defied the expectations of cynics on both sides. After being presented with new demands, Columbia is refusing to comply. No thanks to our fair-weather friends, our acting president, Claire Shipman, has vowed to reject any agreement in which “the government dictates what we teach, research or who we hire” as well as one that would “require us to relinquish our independence and autonomy as an educational institution.” Columbia alumni are rallying in support.\n\n\nThe greatness of American universities is at risk because anti-intellectuals are undermining the foundation of academic excellence: the ability of teachers and researchers to work without political micromanagement in the pursuit of truth, even when these truths are unpopular. Colleges and universities should join a mutual defense pact, as faculty members at several universities, including Rutgers and Indiana University have proposed.

In the rare areas where the president — or perhaps Elon Musk — may see value in research, the emergent mafia state is almost certain to distribute funds to its friends. One shudders to think what universities would have to do to fit themselves into that category.\n\n\nSo this is my radical proposal for universities: Act like universities, not like businesses.

It is primarily about the acquisition of power — power for its own sake. It is a multifront assault to make the earth a playground for ruthless men, so of course any institutions that might restrain power must be weakened or destroyed. Trumpism is about ego, appetite and acquisitiveness and is driven by a primal aversion to the higher elements of the human spirit — learning, compassion, scientific wonder, the pursuit of justice.\n\n\nThese are not separate battles. This is a single effort to undo the parts of the civilizational order that might restrain Trump’s acquisition of power. And it will take a concerted response to beat it back.\n\n\nSlowly, many of us are realizing that we need to band together. But even these efforts are insular and fragmented.\n\n\nLet’s take the universities. I’ve been privileged to teach at American universities off and on for nearly 30 years and I get to visit a dozen or two others every year. These are the crown jewels of American life.

Martin Wolf of the Financial Times argued recently that Trump, like Mao Zedong in China more than 50 years ago, has embarked on a “cultural revolution” that seeks “to overthrow the bureaucratic and cultural elites” that are anchored in the nation’s great universities.\n\n\nLiberal professors aren’t yet forced to wear dunce caps or work in “reeducation camps” in farms and factories.

This is what the Administration is doing by demanding Harvard accede to “viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\nThe Administration is also overstepping its authority by imposing sweeping conditions on funds that weren’t spelled out by Congress. The Justices held in Cummings (2022) that “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously” to ensure the recipient “voluntarily and knowingly accept[ed] the terms.”\n\n\nWhat Harvard Has Set the Stage For\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/harvard-university-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Thanks EI)\n\nWith these words, Harvard became the first university to officially resist the administration’s abusive intimidation, and it is urgent that it not be the only one. Its actions, supported in recent weeks in statements by other academic leaders, including the presidents of Princeton and Wesleyan, light the way forward on a vital path to fighting President Trump’s war on the independence of higher education.\n\n\nIf universities accept Mr. Trump’s terms, on the other hand, the consequence would be far greater, undermining the very purpose of an independent institution.\n\n\nHarvard Had No Choice\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/harvard-had-no-choice\n\nThus, its decision deserves either praise for courage or condemnation for foolhardiness. I choose praise — in no small part because, as we have already seen with Columbia, capitulation to President Trump’s demands brings only more demands. There’s no point in selling your soul if all you receive in exchange is a worthless IOU.\n\n\nThe anti-intellectual ideologues (no, that’s not an oxymoron) running education policy within and adjacent to the White House do not wish to reform higher education; they want to break it.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: If You’re Boycotting Columbia, Your Priorities Are All Wrong\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/columbia-university-boycott-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThen came the circular firing squad. By mid-April, 2,000 people and more than 75 organizations, most of them faculty groups, had signed onto a boycott of our events, and said they would refuse to work with Columbia scholars, like myself, a vice dean, who hold administrative positions.\n\n\nOne of the main organizers of the boycott, the City University of New York anthropologist Gary Wilder, has struggled to explain this strange form of solidarity.\n\nBut\n\nColumbia would not allow any government to deny professors their rightful role in personnel decisions or to dictate the content of our curricula. Nor would we collaborate with government agents intent on deporting our students and faculty members simply because they exercised their First Amendment rights. At no point did our leadership concede any of these essential principles, which is surely why Columbia has been under Department of Justice investigation “for harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus.”\n\n\nNow that Harvard University has decided to defy the Trump administration, the stage is set for an epic struggle, one that has already defied the expectations of cynics on both sides. After being presented with new demands, Columbia is refusing to comply. No thanks to our fair-weather friends, our acting president, Claire Shipman, has vowed to reject any agreement in which “the government dictates what we teach, research or who we hire” as well as one that would “require us to relinquish our independence and autonomy as an educational institution.” Columbia alumni are rallying in support.\n\n\nThe greatness of American universities is at risk because anti-intellectuals are undermining the foundation of academic excellence: the ability of teachers and researchers to work without political micromanagement in the pursuit of truth, even when these truths are unpopular. Colleges and universities should join a mutual defense pact, as faculty members at several universities, including Rutgers and Indiana University have proposed. If we speak with one voice, we can better articulate the essential importance of universities to the American way of life.\n\n\nWe have now seen that the Trump administration manages the economy with the same expertise and competence it manages higher education, and as a result we might begin to rally the American people. If, instead, academics choose to boycott colleagues rather than stand with them, they become accomplices in the very assault on academic freedom they wish to oppose.\n\n\n\n\n\nCornell Sues DOE for ‘Unlawful’ Cuts to Indirect Costs for Research Grants - The Cornell Daily Sun\n\nhttps://www.cornellsun.com/article/2025/04/breaking-cornell-sues-doe-following-1-billion-funding-freeze\n\nACE and others file lawsuite to prevent DOE cuts\n\nhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.283318/gov.uscourts.mad.283318.1.0.pdf\n\n\n\n\nBrown Takes Out $300 Million Loan\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/17/brown-takes-out-300-million-loan\n\nBoth Harvard University and Princeton University announced in recent weeks that they were issuing bonds.

Research grants should be awarded to a mix of recipients likely to produce immediately demonstrable results and recipients with the potential for potentially longer-term, breakthrough results, in a manner consistent with the funding opportunity announcement.\n\n\nTo the extent institutional affiliation is considered in making discretionary awards, agencies should prioritize an institution’s commitment to rigorous, reproducible scholarship over its historical reputation or perceived prestige.\n\n\nAs to science grants, agencies should prioritize institutions that have demonstrated success in implementing Gold Standard Science.\n\n(This is a May 23 executive order)\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/restoring-gold-standard-science/\n\nTrump Puts Political Appointees in Charge of Federal Grant Decisions\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/08/trump-political-appointees-charge-grant-decisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Administration Illegally Withheld N.I.H. Funding, Watchdog Finds\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/us/politics/trump-gao-nih-funding.html\n\nIt was the fifth time that the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan legislative agency, faulted President Trump and his top aides for rearranging the budget in defiance of Congress. From February to June, investigators estimated, the N.I.H. awarded $8 billion less for research and other grants than it had a year earlier.\n\n\nThe findings underscored the real stakes in the growing clash between the Trump administration and Congress over the power of the purse. Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has adopted an expansive view of his authority to recalibrate the federal ledger as he sees fit, even though the Constitution gives lawmakers the power to tax and spend.\n\n\nHow Many Times Can Science Funding Be Canceled?\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/08/nih-funding-whiplash/683773/\n\nLast week, the National Institutes of Health finally got some good news. A Senate subcommittee voted, with support from both parties, to increase the agency’s $48 billion budget—a direct rebuke to the Trump administration’s proposed budget\n\n\nBut inside the agency, officials could not wholeheartedly celebrate. Its political leadership has shredded the NIH playbook so thoroughly, current and former NIH officials told me, that even at current funding levels they are unable to perform their core work of vetting and powering some of the best scientific research around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Humanities Endowment Funds Trump’s Priorities After Ending Old Grants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/arts/national-endowment-for-the-humanities-trump-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe National Endowment for the Humanities abruptly canceled virtually all of its existing grants in April, citing a desire to pivot to “the president’s agenda.” Now it has announced its largest round of grants since, $34.8 million in funding for 97 projects across the country that helps show what that means.\n\n\nThe grants include many focused on presidents, statesmen and canonical authors, including $10 million to the University of Virginia — which the agency said was the largest grant in its history — that will support the “expedited completion” of editorial work on papers relating to the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolution and the Founding era.\n\n\nNone of the new grants are explicitly related to L.G.B.T.Q. issues. And while there are several projects about prominent female figures, including Emily Dickinson and Marianne Moore, only one appears to take a broader look at gender and women’s history: a $700,000 grant to City Lore, a media company in New York, to support a documentary about female reporters during the Vietnam War.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Amps Up an Obama Strategy to Crack Down on Colleges\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/06/us/politics/trump-universities-title-ix-vi-obama.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nTo show they are serious about stamping out campus antisemitism, some of the nation’s top universities are adding a powerful position to their administrative ranks.\n\n\nThe position has a modest sounding title: Title VI coordinator. The responsibilities, however, are significant: to oversee and ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in federally funded programs “on the ground of race, color or national origin” and also covers Jews, Arab Muslims and other religious groups.\n\n\nBut some legal experts warn that expanding Title VI oversight could lead universities into contentious thickets over defining antisemitic speech and adjudicating complaints of harassment. The end result, they say, could set new limits for permissible forms of expression, chilling speech on the quad and in the classroom.\n\n\nHistorically, Title IX authorized the government to monitor whether educational institutions — not students — were engaged in discriminatory conduct.\n\n\nBut in a pivotal shift, the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights published new guidance for institutions in 2011. The office said that for institutions to remain in compliance with Title IX — and eligible for federal funds — they were required to thoroughly investigate and adjudicate sexual assault allegations with a disciplinary process and a standard of evidence that many critics said favored accusers. An institution’s investigative process, the guidance said, would be subject to federal review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Legislature Kills Your Department\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/when-the-legislature-kills-your-department\n(Thanks VAC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern Accreditor Launches New ROI Tool\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/06/western-accreditor-launches-new-roi-tool\n\nWSCUC officials said the PEP metric will help universities, students and lawmakers better understand how specific programs compare within institutions and to national benchmarks. The change comes as the federal government looks to require all programs to pass an earnings test in order to qualify for federal student loans.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia and Brown to Disclose Admissions and Race Data in Trump Deal\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/nyregion/columbia-brown-admissions-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAs part of the settlements struck with two Ivy League universities in recent weeks, the Trump administration will gain access to the standardized test scores and grade point averages of all applicants, including information about their race, a measure that could profoundly alter competitive college admissions.\n\n\nThe release of such data has been on the wish list of conservatives who are searching for evidence that universities are dodging a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring the consideration of race in college admissions, and will probably be sought in the future from many more of them.\n\n\nBut college officials and experts who support using factors beyond test scores worry that the government — or private groups or individuals — will use the data to file new discrimination charges against universities and threaten their federal funding.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Live Updates: President Orders Closer Scrutiny of College Admissions Data\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/08/07/us/trump-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAdmissions data: Mr. Trump signed a memorandum requiring colleges to submit admissions data to the federal government to verify that they have ended race-conscious policies. The directive comes as the administration takes aim at the ideological and racial balance of the higher education system and could profoundly alter competitive college admissions.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/us/politics/trump-schools-race-data.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/traditional-age/2025/08/07/trump-orders-colleges-supply-data-race-admissions\n\nWhat resources are in place to enforce the new requirements remains to be seen. Earlier this year the administration razed the staff at the Department of Education who historically collected and analyzed institutional data. Only three staff members remain in the National Center for Education Statistics, which operates IPEDS.\n\n\n“I will say something that my members in the higher education community cannot say. What the Trump administration is really saying is that you will be punished if you do not admit enough white students to your institution,” Angel B.

Garber ’76 has told faculty that a deal with the Trump administration is not imminent and denied that the University is considering a $500 million settlement, according to three faculty members familiar with the matter.\n\n\nThe University is seriously considering resolving its dispute with the White House through the courts rather than a negotiated settlement, Garber said, according to the three faculty members.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Deal-Making With Other Elite Schools Scrambles Harvard Negotiations\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/us/politics/harvard-trump-brown.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe university was open to spending $500 million, but a $50 million settlement with Brown has prompted new debates in Cambridge.\n\n(Who is the source of this reporting is not detailed…)\n\nThe terms stunned officials at Harvard, who marveled that another Ivy League school got away with paying so little, according to three people familiar with the deliberations. But Harvard officials also bristled over how their university, after months of work to address antisemitism on campus and with a seeming advantage in its court fight against the government, was facing a demand from Mr. Trump to pay 10 times more.\n\n\nThe people who discussed the deliberations spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing talks that are supposed to remain confidential.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Funding Starts to Flow Back to Columbia, Brown\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/08/01/research-funding-starts-flow-back-columbia-brown https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/08/01/research-funding-starts-flow-back-columbia-brown\n(Watch this space…my over/under is 2 months until we see something different)\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Is Freezing Over $300 Million for U.C.L.A.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/01/us/politics/trump-cuts-ucla-funding-federal-research.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe federal government is freezing over $300 million in research funds for the University of California, Los Angeles, over claims of antisemitism and bias at the institution, according to its chancellor and Trump administration documents.\n\n\nThe Trump administration paused the research funding as part of an investigation by the government’s antisemitism task force, two administration officials said. The freeze included about $240 million in research grants from the Health and Human Services Department and the N.I.H., $81 million from the N.S.F. and $18.2 million from the Energy Department, a White House spokeswoman said.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the university agreed to pay more than $6 million to settle a lawsuit from Jewish students and a professor who said that the university had allowed a hostile protest on campus. After the settlement was announced, the Department of Justice separately said that it had found the university violated civil rights laws by failing to respond to students’ complaints of antisemitism.\n\n\nWith Grant Cuts, Trump Pressures UCLA to Make Deal\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/2025/08/04/grant-cuts-trump-pressures-ucla-make-deal https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/2025/08/04/grant-cuts-trump-pressures-ucla-make-deal\n\nThe letter didn’t specifically say what the Trump administration wants UC to do now about its alleged failure to handle a pro-Palestine encampment that ended more than a year ago, and that UCLA itself dismantled a week after its creation. The DOJ didn’t provide Inside Higher Ed further information Monday, but U.S. attorney general Pam Bondi’s news release accompanying the DOJ letter suggests the Trump administration wants significant concessions.\n\n\nWhat does the UC system plan to do? A spokesperson deferred comment to UCLA, which also didn’t provide interviews Monday or answer written questions. The UC system spokesperson did forward a statement Friday from system president James B. Milliken, who started in his new job Aug. 1—just after the grant freezes.\n\n\nMilliken called “the suspension this week of a large number of research grants and contracts” at UCLA “deeply troubling,” though “not unexpected.”\n\n\nAlso Friday, California governor Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate and an ex officio member of the UC Board of Regents, released a statement calling it “a cruel manipulation to use Jewish students’ real concerns about antisemitism on campus as an excuse to cut millions of dollars in grants that were being used to make all Americans safer and healthier.”\n\n\n“This is the action of a president who doesn’t care about students, Californians, or Americans who don’t comply with his MAGA ways,” Newsom said.\n\n\n23 Cents Per American: The Price of Destroying Mathematical Research\n\nhttps://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/8/3/2336574/-58-Cents-Per-American-The-Price-of-Destroying-Mathematical-Research\n\nThe Trump administration just suspended Terence Tao’s NSF grant—not because his research lacks merit, but as collateral damage in a political vendetta against UCLA. If you don’t know who Tao is, imagine if they’d cut Einstein’s funding in 1915.\n\n\nThe NSF has slashed basic science funding by over 50% in 2025. Mathematical sciences funding dropped from a 10-year average of $113 million to just $32 million through May. With 350 million Americans, that’s 32 cents per person down to 9 cents—a cut of 23 cents per American.\n\n\nThe result? We’re not just cutting mathematical research to save 24 cents per American—we’re also using science funding as a political weapon, punishing entire universities and the researchers who work there.\n\n(Thanks JC)\n\nHe’s the ‘Mozart’ of Math and Trump Killed His Funding\n\nhttps://www.thebulwark.com/p/terence-tao-ucla-mathematician-mozart-of-math-trump-funding-nsf\n\nThe University of California system agrees to negotiate with Trump after more than $500 million in federal research funds are frozen\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/ucla-trump-university-california-negotiations-public-7ef576d9?st=rsdKeK&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nThe University of California educates around 300,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its 10 campuses spread across the state.\n\n\nUC has said it receives more National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation funding than any other institution in the country. The system receives almost 6,700 federal grants and contracts totaling $3.85 billion.\n\n\nThe UC negotiations will be among Milliken’s first acts in his job running the 10-campus system, a position he officially took on Aug. 1 after years at the helm of the University of Texas and other public-school systems.\n\n\nThese cuts do nothing to address antisemitism,” Milliken said Wednesday of the hundreds of suspended grants to UCLA.

Community Colleges Are Being Hit.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/magazine/trump-community-college-anti-dei.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nSince January, the Trump administration has waged war on the nation’s wealthiest and most prestigious universities, freezing billions of dollars in research grants to Harvard and blasting away at Columbia’s institutional autonomy. But collateral damage from these attacks has engulfed schools of all types, including the country’s 1,100 community colleges, which educate about 6.4 million undergraduates each year — roughly 40 percent of the national total and more than twice as many as are enrolled at every highly selective college and university in the country combined.\n\n\nLike their four-year counterparts, community colleges are grappling with disappearing federal grants, shuttered D.E.I. offices, eliminated programs, canceled cultural convocations and panicked students and staff. At Delta, many of the grants that fund financial aid for low-income students and the staff that support them have been eliminated or threatened. I went to see the hydraulic-circuit class in part because of how much government funding, a great deal of it federal, it takes to make the teaching possible. It was hardly the only class I could have chosen: Federal funding helps pay not just for heavy machinery used in courses like the one taught by Luna but also, elsewhere on the Delta campus, for the full dental lab for aspiring hygienists; the X-ray machines surrounded by lead-lined walls for radiography students; and the robotic medical mannequins, one that pushed out little baby mannequins and could simulate everything from a breech birth to a health emergency.\n\n\nI also came to Delta to meet its president, Mike Gavin, who in this moment of fear and uncertainty has emerged as a kind of spokesman for America’s community colleges as a whole. Gavin heads an improvised coalition of community-college presidents and administrators called Education for All, which, amid the responses to the federal government’s assaults, has been the rare example of collective action among higher-ed leadership.\n\n\nUnlike elite universities, community colleges often can’t afford to keep an in-house counsel on payroll, let alone the teams of lawyers who have been advising Ivy League schools on their present predicament. So Education for All members, in addition to offering solidarity and support, provided advice on how their schools could navigate all the hurdles being thrown in front of them.\n\n(Much more in this long piece)\n\nInternational Student Enrollment Could Drop 15% by Fall\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/08/05/international-student-enrollment-could-drop-15\n\nNew international enrollments in the U.S. could drop by as many as 150,000 students in the next year, according to scenario modeling by NAFSA, the association of international educators, and JB International.\n\n\n“This analysis … should serve as a clarion call to the State Department that it must act to ensure international students and scholars are able to arrive on U.S. campuses this fall,” said Fanta Aw, executive director and CEO of NAFSA, in a press release. “For the United States to succeed in the global economy, we must keep our doors open to students from around the world.”\n\n\nStanford Plans to Cut 363 Jobs\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/05/stanford-plans-cut-363-jobs\n\nStanford president Jon Levin and provost Jenny Martinez noted in a letter to campus that the cuts were part of an effort announced last month to reduce $140 million in the general funds budget. They called the layoffs, reported Tuesday, “the product of a challenging fiscal environment shaped in large part by federal policy changes affecting higher education.”\n\n\nUniversity officials provided more information in a letter filed with the California Employment Development Department that accompanied the layoff notice. They cited “anticipated changes in federal policy—such as reductions in federal research funding and an increase in the excise tax on investment income” as significant factors driving the reduction of Stanford’s workforce.\n\n\nHow Trump Forced Cuts at Wealthy Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/business/cost-cutting/2025/08/07/how-trump-forced-cuts-wealthy-universities\n\nWhile sector layoffs are so frequent that Inside Higher Ed has dedicated monthly coverage to rounding up such reductions, those actions are more common at small, cash-strapped colleges or state institutions reeling from budget cuts. But universities with multibillion-dollar endowments have been among those making the deepest cuts in the first half of 2025, often driven by freezes on federal funding that the Trump administration imposed with minimal notice.\n\n\nAltogether the layoffs show a sector bracing for a new reality where research funding can be suddenly yanked away with little to no explanation and international and graduate student enrollment, once considered a cash cow, is under threat—prompting institutions in even the highest financial stratosphere to cut costs as they navigate changing policies and a president sharply critical of the sector.\n\n\nThousands Out at Johns Hopkins; Hundreds of Buyouts at Duke; Deep Cuts at Northwestern; The Ax Falls at Stanford; Nearly 180 Layoffs at Columbia; ‘A Day of Loss’ at Boston U; Dozens Laid Off at USC; Unspecified Cuts at Harvard; Likely Layoffs at Brown\n\n\nU of Utah Plans to Ax 81 Offerings, Citing New State Law\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/07/u-utah-plans-ax-81-offerings-citing-new-state-law\n\n\n\n\nColumbia, CUNY Law Professors Beat Trump in Court\n\nhttps://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/RonaetalvTrumpetalDocketNo125cv03114SDNYApr152025CourtDocket/1?doc_id=X4HR83K7C2C8G88JPVI1MU7CJNV\n\nIn law, as in life, two wrongs do not make a right.\n\n\nUpon his return to office in 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14,203 (the “2025 Order”), which is substantially similar to the Order that Judge Failla enjoined over four years ago; in fact, it includes the exact language that she found likely unconstitutional.\n\n\nOn the merits, the Court concludes that the 2025 Order violates Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights because it constitutes a content-based regulation of their speech-based activities and cannot survive strict scrutiny. Accordingly, and for the reasons elaborated below, Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED, and they are entitled to a permanent injunction.\n\n\n\n\n\nAI is listening to your meetings.

Research grants should be awarded to a mix of recipients likely to produce immediately demonstrable results and recipients with the potential for potentially longer-term, breakthrough results, in a manner consistent with the funding opportunity announcement.\n\n\nTo the extent institutional affiliation is considered in making discretionary awards, agencies should prioritize an institution’s commitment to rigorous, reproducible scholarship over its historical reputation or perceived prestige.\n\n\nAs to science grants, agencies should prioritize institutions that have demonstrated success in implementing Gold Standard Science.\n\n(This is a May 23 executive order)\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/restoring-gold-standard-science/\n\nTrump Puts Political Appointees in Charge of Federal Grant Decisions\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/08/trump-political-appointees-charge-grant-decisions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Administration Illegally Withheld N.I.H. Funding, Watchdog Finds\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/us/politics/trump-gao-nih-funding.html\n\nIt was the fifth time that the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan legislative agency, faulted President Trump and his top aides for rearranging the budget in defiance of Congress. From February to June, investigators estimated, the N.I.H. awarded $8 billion less for research and other grants than it had a year earlier.\n\n\nThe findings underscored the real stakes in the growing clash between the Trump administration and Congress over the power of the purse. Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has adopted an expansive view of his authority to recalibrate the federal ledger as he sees fit, even though the Constitution gives lawmakers the power to tax and spend.\n\n\nHow Many Times Can Science Funding Be Canceled?\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/08/nih-funding-whiplash/683773/\n\nLast week, the National Institutes of Health finally got some good news. A Senate subcommittee voted, with support from both parties, to increase the agency’s $48 billion budget—a direct rebuke to the Trump administration’s proposed budget\n\n\nBut inside the agency, officials could not wholeheartedly celebrate. Its political leadership has shredded the NIH playbook so thoroughly, current and former NIH officials told me, that even at current funding levels they are unable to perform their core work of vetting and powering some of the best scientific research around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Humanities Endowment Funds Trump’s Priorities After Ending Old Grants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/arts/national-endowment-for-the-humanities-trump-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe National Endowment for the Humanities abruptly canceled virtually all of its existing grants in April, citing a desire to pivot to “the president’s agenda.” Now it has announced its largest round of grants since, $34.8 million in funding for 97 projects across the country that helps show what that means.\n\n\nThe grants include many focused on presidents, statesmen and canonical authors, including $10 million to the University of Virginia — which the agency said was the largest grant in its history — that will support the “expedited completion” of editorial work on papers relating to the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolution and the Founding era.\n\n\nNone of the new grants are explicitly related to L.G.B.T.Q. issues. And while there are several projects about prominent female figures, including Emily Dickinson and Marianne Moore, only one appears to take a broader look at gender and women’s history: a $700,000 grant to City Lore, a media company in New York, to support a documentary about female reporters during the Vietnam War.",

The responsibilities, however, are significant: to oversee and ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination in federally funded programs “on the ground of race, color or national origin” and also covers Jews, Arab Muslims and other religious groups.\n\n\nBut some legal experts warn that expanding Title VI oversight could lead universities into contentious thickets over defining antisemitic speech and adjudicating complaints of harassment. The end result, they say, could set new limits for permissible forms of expression, chilling speech on the quad and in the classroom.\n\n\nHistorically, Title IX authorized the government to monitor whether educational institutions — not students — were engaged in discriminatory conduct.\n\n\nBut in a pivotal shift, the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights published new guidance for institutions in 2011. The office said that for institutions to remain in compliance with Title IX — and eligible for federal funds — they were required to thoroughly investigate and adjudicate sexual assault allegations with a disciplinary process and a standard of evidence that many critics said favored accusers. An institution’s investigative process, the guidance said, would be subject to federal review.",

The freeze included about $240 million in research grants from the Health and Human Services Department and the N.I.H., $81 million from the N.S.F. and $18.2 million from the Energy Department, a White House spokeswoman said.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the university agreed to pay more than $6 million to settle a lawsuit from Jewish students and a professor who said that the university had allowed a hostile protest on campus. After the settlement was announced, the Department of Justice separately said that it had found the university violated civil rights laws by failing to respond to students’ complaints of antisemitism.\n\n\nWith Grant Cuts, Trump Pressures UCLA to Make Deal\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/2025/08/04/grant-cuts-trump-pressures-ucla-make-deal https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/2025/08/04/grant-cuts-trump-pressures-ucla-make-deal\n\nThe letter didn’t specifically say what the Trump administration wants UC to do now about its alleged failure to handle a pro-Palestine encampment that ended more than a year ago, and that UCLA itself dismantled a week after its creation. The DOJ didn’t provide Inside Higher Ed further information Monday, but U.S. attorney general Pam Bondi’s news release accompanying the DOJ letter suggests the Trump administration wants significant concessions.\n\n\nWhat does the UC system plan to do? A spokesperson deferred comment to UCLA, which also didn’t provide interviews Monday or answer written questions. The UC system spokesperson did forward a statement Friday from system president James B. Milliken, who started in his new job Aug. 1—just after the grant freezes.\n\n\nMilliken called “the suspension this week of a large number of research grants and contracts” at UCLA “deeply troubling,” though “not unexpected.”\n\n\nAlso Friday, California governor Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate and an ex officio member of the UC Board of Regents, released a statement calling it “a cruel manipulation to use Jewish students’ real concerns about antisemitism on campus as an excuse to cut millions of dollars in grants that were being used to make all Americans safer and healthier.”\n\n\n“This is the action of a president who doesn’t care about students, Californians, or Americans who don’t comply with his MAGA ways,” Newsom said.\n\n\n23 Cents Per American: The Price of Destroying Mathematical Research\n\nhttps://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/8/3/2336574/-58-Cents-Per-American-The-Price-of-Destroying-Mathematical-Research\n\nThe Trump administration just suspended Terence Tao’s NSF grant—not because his research lacks merit, but as collateral damage in a political vendetta against UCLA. If you don’t know who Tao is, imagine if they’d cut Einstein’s funding in 1915.\n\n\nThe NSF has slashed basic science funding by over 50% in 2025.

    "text": "NYTimes: Trump Went to War With the Ivies. Community Colleges Are Being Hit.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/magazine/trump-community-college-anti-dei.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nSince January, the Trump administration has waged war on the nation’s wealthiest and most prestigious universities, freezing billions of dollars in research grants to Harvard and blasting away at Columbia’s institutional autonomy. But collateral damage from these attacks has engulfed schools of all types, including the country’s 1,100 community colleges, which educate about 6.4 million undergraduates each year — roughly 40 percent of the national total and more than twice as many as are enrolled at every highly selective college and university in the country combined.\n\n\nLike their four-year counterparts, community colleges are grappling with disappearing federal grants, shuttered D.E.I. offices, eliminated programs, canceled cultural convocations and panicked students and staff. At Delta, many of the grants that fund financial aid for low-income students and the staff that support them have been eliminated or threatened. I went to see the hydraulic-circuit class in part because of how much government funding, a great deal of it federal, it takes to make the teaching possible. It was hardly the only class I could have chosen: Federal funding helps pay not just for heavy machinery used in courses like the one taught by Luna but also, elsewhere on the Delta campus, for the full dental lab for aspiring hygienists; the X-ray machines surrounded by lead-lined walls for radiography students; and the robotic medical mannequins, one that pushed out little baby mannequins and could simulate everything from a breech birth to a health emergency.\n\n\nI also came to Delta to meet its president, Mike Gavin, who in this moment of fear and uncertainty has emerged as a kind of spokesman for America’s community colleges as a whole. Gavin heads an improvised coalition of community-college presidents and administrators called Education for All, which, amid the responses to the federal government’s assaults, has been the rare example of collective action among higher-ed leadership.\n\n\nUnlike elite universities, community colleges often can’t afford to keep an in-house counsel on payroll, let alone the teams of lawyers who have been advising Ivy League schools on their present predicament. So Education for All members, in addition to offering solidarity and support, provided advice on how their schools could navigate all the hurdles being thrown in front of them.\n\n(Much more in this long piece)\n\nInternational Student Enrollment Could Drop 15% by Fall\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/08/05/international-student-enrollment-could-drop-15\n\nNew international enrollments in the U.S. could drop by as many as 150,000 students in the next year, according to scenario modeling by NAFSA, the association of international educators, and JB International.\n\n\n“This analysis … should serve as a clarion call to the State Department that it must act to ensure international students and scholars are able to arrive on U.S. campuses this fall,” said Fanta Aw, executive director and CEO of NAFSA, in a press release. “For the United States to succeed in the global economy, we must keep our doors open to students from around the world.”\n\n\nStanford Plans to Cut 363 Jobs\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/05/stanford-plans-cut-363-jobs\n\nStanford president Jon Levin and provost Jenny Martinez noted in a letter to campus that the cuts were part of an effort announced last month to reduce $140 million in the general funds budget. They called the layoffs, reported Tuesday, “the product of a challenging fiscal environment shaped in large part by federal policy changes affecting higher education.”\n\n\nUniversity officials provided more information in a letter filed with the California Employment Development Department that accompanied the layoff notice. They cited “anticipated changes in federal policy—such as reductions in federal research funding and an increase in the excise tax on investment income” as significant factors driving the reduction of Stanford’s workforce.\n\n\nHow Trump Forced Cuts at Wealthy Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/business/cost-cutting/2025/08/07/how-trump-forced-cuts-wealthy-universities\n\nWhile sector layoffs are so frequent that Inside Higher Ed has dedicated monthly coverage to rounding up such reductions, those actions are more common at small, cash-strapped colleges or state institutions reeling from budget cuts. But universities with multibillion-dollar endowments have been among those making the deepest cuts in the first half of 2025, often driven by freezes on federal funding that the Trump administration imposed with minimal notice.\n\n\nAltogether the layoffs show a sector bracing for a new reality where research funding can be suddenly yanked away with little to no explanation and international and graduate student enrollment, once considered a cash cow, is under threat—prompting institutions in even the highest financial stratosphere to cut costs as they navigate changing policies and a president sharply critical of the sector.\n\n\nThousands Out at Johns Hopkins; Hundreds of Buyouts at Duke; Deep Cuts at Northwestern; The Ax Falls at Stanford; Nearly 180 Layoffs at Columbia; ‘A Day of Loss’ at Boston U; Dozens Laid Off at USC; Unspecified Cuts at Harvard; Likely Layoffs at Brown\n\n\nU of Utah Plans to Ax 81 Offerings, Citing New State Law\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/07/u-utah-plans-ax-81-offerings-citing-new-state-law",

A coordinated political campaign is working to delegitimize universities, restrict what can be taught, punish open inquiry, and dismantle institutional autonomy. These efforts are already causing real harm—targeting international students, undermining financial aid, making it harder for many to access or afford a college education, and defunding life-enhancing research. They threaten the values that make higher education vital to democracy: free speech, academic freedom, inclusion, and the pursuit of knowledge. To protect those values, we must come together—across campuses, communities, and differences—in common cause.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Alarmed by Trump Cuts, Scientists Are Talking Science. For 100 Hours.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/climate/science-livestream-budget-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDr. Rind’s presentation was the first of many in a planned, 100-hour-long livestream featuring hundreds of climate scientists and meteorologists from across the United States. They are protesting cuts to funding for atmospheric science and calling out potential risks to weather forecasts. The livestream started on Wednesday and is scheduled to run continuously through June 1, the first day of the Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Is a Summer to Organize (opinion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/06/03/summer-organize-opinion\n\nFaculty may long for a break, but the government is actively operationalizing Project 2025, a blueprint for remaking every public institution, with higher education being the crown jewel of its antidemocratic agenda. At his 100-day rally in Michigan, Donald Trump declared, “We’ve just gotten started. You haven’t even seen anything yet.” Christopher Rufo, architect of the right-wing culture war, promises to plunge higher education still further into “an existential terror.”\n\n\nWe should be prepared for a potential wave of coordinated assaults on higher education this summer: reductions in Pell Grant eligibility for low-income students and slashed student loans, more dismantlement of scientific research funding, politicized accreditation crackdowns, new endowment taxes, expanded intimidation of international students and scholars, and further weaponization of Title VI and Title IX enforcement.\n\n\nWe recommend mobilizing on two simultaneous fronts this summer: by operationalizing mutual academic defense compacts (MADCs), and through direct activism. We must forge powerful alliances for mass protest. We suggest one often-overlooked but deeply strategic constituency— veterans.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademia’s Holy Warriors\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/academias-holy-warriors/\n\nThe idea is central to Deneen’s [Notre Dame political-science professor] argument in Why Liberalism Failed, which announces America’s failed — past tense — liberal tradition. For Deneen, “liberalism” refers not just to the political beliefs of self-identified liberals or progressives, but also to the broader, rights-based political philosophy that has guided both major political parties for most of American history.\n\n\nAs Deneen was speaking, blueberry pie was served to an audience that included Rod Dreher, the well-known American Conservative blogger and author of The Benedict Option; Matthew Schmitz, an editor of the ecumenical religious journal First Things; and Bria Sandford, editorial director of Penguin’s right-of-center Sentinel book division. The next morning, the New York Times columnist Ross Douthat arrived\n\n\nIn the year and a half since the conference, other writers who have staked out public positions on the nonliberal right include the Harvard law professor Adrian Vermeule, the First Things editor R.R. Reno, the former Washington Examiner managing editor Helen Andrews, and the University of Dallas assistant professor of political science — and deputy editor of the journal American Affairs — Gladden Pappin. One might add Mary Ann Glendon, the Harvard law professor and former ambassador to the Vatican, who in July was named the head of President Trump’s Commission on Unalienable Rights.\n\n\nThe radicals, on the other hand, were those who believed that American liberalism had always been deeply hostile to the core values of Catholics.\n\n\nHarvard Law professor Adrian Vermeule accused Deneen of failing to grapple fully with the consequences of his own diagnosis. … What was needed was not the creation of new societies — which would survive only at the forbearance of the reigning powers — but a coup against the liberal “imperium” from within. … Rather than withdrawing from the power centers of liberal society, Vermeule recommends that administrators and other elites find a “strategic position” from which, as dissatisfaction with liberalism grows, they can turn that bureaucracy to “new ends.”\n\n(Deenan also raises the ire of David Brooks:)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/opinion/trump-vance-morality.html\n\nParks, libraries, museums: here’s why Trump is attacking America’s best-loved institutions | Margaret Sullivan | The Guardian\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/02/national-parks-libraries-museums-trump\n\nIt seems counterintuitive, but this is all a part of a broad plan that the great 20th-century political thinker Hannah Arendt would have understood all too well.\n\n\nTake away natural beauty, free access to books and support for the arts, and you end up with a less enlightened, more ignorant and less engaged public. That’s a public much more easily manipulated.\n\n\n“A people that can no longer believe in anything cannot make up its mind,” said Arendt, a student of authoritarianism, in 1973. Eventually, such a public “is deprived … of its ability to think and judge”, and with people like that, “you can then do what you please”.\n\n\n\n\n\nRed states tell colleges: Race and gender classes are out, civics in\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/02/republican-state-laws-university-college-classes/\n\nNew laws in Ohio, Utah and Florida are reshaping general education, the core classes college students take to meet graduation requirements. The laws mandate that students take civics courses focused on Western civilization and bar classes centered on race or gender from counting toward core requirements.\n\n\nState lawmakers have the authority to regulate curriculums and set requirements for graduation, but higher education experts say that until recently, they have let public colleges and universities lead the way. That began to change in 2020 after the first Trump administration issued an executive order to stamp out “divisive concepts” about race and gender in the federal government, according to the American Association of University Professors and American Federation of Teachers.\n\n\n“This is a new type of local intervention,” said Keith E. Whittington, founding chair of the Academic Committee of the Academic Freedom Alliance. “Some of the proposals are making more elaborate interventions about what the curriculum ought to look like and are also increasingly interested in the content.”\n\n\nHouse Democrats Air Grievances With McMahon\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/05/mcmahon-faces-angry-house-democrats\n\nThe Trump administration has recently criticized what it sees as a lack of viewpoint diversity at Harvard University and demanded that the institution hire more conservative professors if it would like to regain access to federal grant funding. At a Senate hearing Tuesday, McMahon said a federal law that prevents discrimination based on race and national origin gave the department the authority to make such demands.\n\n\nTakano [California Democrat] snapped back, saying, “I think it’s pretty clear you haven’t thought through this idea of viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\nNYTimes: A Professor Was Fired for Her Politics. Is That the Future of Academia?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/magazine/academic-freedom-politics.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut that night, reading Kanazi’s words while taking in the news, she felt a pitch of fury and despair at the rising number of dead in Gaza and her sense that too few Americans were similarly horrified. She believed in her right to state her beliefs and share those of others, like Kanazi, with whom she sympathized. Besides, the post would disappear from her Instagram stories by the following evening.\n\n\nTwo days later, on a Friday, Finkelstein got an email from Jennifer Storm, the director of equity and Title IX at Muhlenberg, asking her to come to a meeting the following Monday — with a lawyer if she wanted one.\n\n\nBut the meeting, which took place a week later on Zoom with Finkelstein’s lawyer present, was entirely about her repost. Finkelstein was told not to return to campus and locked out of her email. Her classes would be reassigned to an adjunct professor while the college hired an outside firm to investigate.\n\n\nThe investigation stretched over the spring semester. Then, in May, Finkelstein received a new letter from the college: She was being fired, with cause. This despite her having tenure, a historic form of academic job protection meant to insulate scholars from the steamrolling power of both politics and public opinion. Less noticed at the time, but arguably more prophetic, was how the mechanics of her firing trammeled yet another longtime standard in the academy, that of professors’ deciding among themselves when and if a colleague should be fired.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration’s big week of gaslighting and censorship\n\nhttps://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-free-speech-harvard-marco-rubio-rfk-jr-censorship-rcna209870\n\nOver the course of the past week alone — in the name of academic, scientific and online “freedom” — Trump and his administration’s bigwigs have explicitly threatened free speech in at least a half-dozen different ways.\n\n\nNYTimes: A Student at Brown Channeled Elon Musk. Then He Got in Trouble.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/brown-university-newspaper-musk-doge.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThousands of administrative employees at Brown University woke up this spring to an email with pointed Elon Musk-like questions about their job responsibilities.\n\n\nPlease describe your role, it asked. What tasks have you performed in the past week? How would Brown students be affected if your job didn’t exist?\n\n\nThe March 18 email was from a sophomore, Alex Shieh, who explained that the responses would be included in a story for The Brown Spectator, a new, as yet unpublished conservative newspaper on campus.\n\n\nTwo days later, Brown notified Mr. Shieh that he was under investigation for possible violations of the university’s code of student conduct, including its prohibitions on invasion of privacy, misrepresentation and emotional or psychological harm.\n\n\nWith that, his case — and that of two Spectator students who were later placed under investigation — became the latest flashpoint in the free speech wars on American college campuses.\n\n\nBrown eventually cleared all three students of wrongdoing. But their case is yet another example of how universities continue to struggle with protecting the rights of students to express themselves on campus, after years of trying to adjudicate just when political expression tips into harassment.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Attacks on Black History Betray America\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/opinion/black-history-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration’s framing of Black history as “D.E.I.” — and “D.E.I.” as harming white Americans — recasts its attack on Black history as protecting white Americans. As administering justice. Which is the justification of nearly every Klan and racist mob attack in history. The justification of the Atlanta attack in 1906.\n\n\nOpinion | Here are the people Trump is trying to delete\n\nhttps://wapo.st/3Hs6XZb\n(Sexism too)\n\nAbout 80 percent of the erased images contained one or more targeted keywords, such as gay, transgender, women, Hispanic and Black.\n\n\nEntire demographics are being scrubbed from records of both America’s past and present — including people of color, transgender people, women, immigrants and people with disabilities. They are now among America’s “missing persons.”\n\n\nPeople who aren’t White are an especially frequent target of government erasure.\n\n\nWomen (alongside racial minorities) have been disproportionately fired in purges of National Institutes of Health science review boards and senior military leadership positions. A landmark study on women’s health — the Women’s Health Initiative — was canceled entirely in April, though eventually restored after significant public outcry. The Labor Department likewise canceled grants for women’s apprenticeship programs last week.\n\n\nMore broadly, the terms “woman” and “women” have also appeared on banned-word lists for federal agency websites, grant applications and other external communications, including at the National Science Foundation and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttacks on Chinese Students Could Wreak Havoc on Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/05/30/trump-targets-chinese-students-harsh-blow-higher\n\nThe targeting of students in “critical fields” in particular could devastate STEM programs and research labs at smaller universities across the country, where Chinese international students are heavily represented. Rubio did not clarify what fields could be considered critical, potentially setting the stage for a sweeping focus on areas where GOP lawmakers have raised concerns about sensitive national security research being shared with the Chinese government.\n\n\nAt a press conference yesterday, department spokesperson Tammy Bruce declined to “get into the details” of how the new visa scrutiny would be applied or what “critical fields” the department was referring to, because it “might give up our hand and make certain things less effective.”\n\n\n“‘Aggressively revoking’ visas based on political ideology is a gross violation of basic free expression principles that anchor the academy,” he [Jonathan Friedman, managing director of U.S. free expression at PEN America] wrote to Inside Higher Ed.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/colleges-across-u-s-fear-chill-on-enrollments-of-foreign-students\n\nThe visa-interview suspension capped a week of bad news: The nominee to oversee the student-visa system vowed to end work authorization for recent international graduates, a move that could seriously dent the appeal of American colleges. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned foreign students who had not updated their employment records that they could face deportation. And the Trump administration took the unprecedented step of revoking Harvard University’s authority to enroll international students as part of an all-fronts showdown with one of the nation’s most prestigious institutions. Other colleges could be next, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in announcing the decision: “Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country.”\n\n\nTrump administration claims Chinese students ‘exploit’ U.S. universities\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/01/china-us-students-national-security-threat/\n\nWhat the New Travel Ban Means for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-the-new-travel-ban-means-for-higher-ed\n\nAnd taken together, the two proclamations underscore the extent to which international students are simultaneously in the crosshairs of two of the most contentious and virulent issues of the Trump presidency, its opposition to immigration and its fight to force higher education to bend to government’s agenda.\n\n\nRestrictions on international students are a powerful lever to use against colleges, many of which have come to rely on the higher tuition paid by foreign students in a time of leaner budgets and domestic demographic declines. At the graduate level, visa holders are the backbone of American research and science.\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Ends In-State Tuition for Undocumented Students\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/05/texas-ends-state-tuition-undocumented-students\n\nThousands of undocumented students in Texas no longer have access to in-state tuition. The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state on Wednesday over its policy of allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at public universities. Within hours, Texas sided with the Justice Department, and U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor granted a permanent injunction, quashing the policy.\n\n\nIn an interview before the permanent injunction, Ahilan Arulanantham, professor from practice at the UCLA School of Law and co-director of the law school’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said he didn’t believe a legal ruling in the Justice Department’s favor would necessarily affect other states, such as California, with similar laws. He said Texas used a residency criterion to decide eligibility for in-state tuition, an approach more vulnerable to legal challenges than some of the criteria other states use.\n\n\nBut even if other states go unscathed, losing in-state tuition benefits is “extraordinarily significant” for the “massive” undocumented population in Texas, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCUNY advocates push for $100M to bridge funding gap and enhance student services\n\nhttps://www.citizenportal.ai/articles/3326181/New-York/CUNY-advocates-push-for-100M-to-bridge-funding-gap-and-enhance-student-services\n(Thanks BE)\n\nScientific Community Fears for Future of STEM Workforce Amid NSF Overhaul\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/05/30/future-stem-workforce-jeopardy-amid-nsf-overhaul\n\nOf the approximately 1,500 grants the agency recently terminated, at least 750 came from the NSF’s education directorate, according to Grant Watch, an independent website that tracks terminated NSF grants. And that’s not the only shake-up happening at the NSF, which Congress created in 1950 to “promote the progress of science; advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; and secure the national defense.” The Trump administration has also laid off staff and proposed slashing the agency’s budget.\n\n\nAdditionally, NSF announced new priorities that include not funding projects aimed at recruiting more Americans from underrepresented backgrounds to the STEM workforce—a key focus for the agency historically.\n\n\nThe Trump administration says all these changes are part of its plan to reform the NSF, correct an alleged “scientific slowdown,” build a “a robust domestic STEM workforce” and “rapidly accelerate its investment in critical and advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology.” The NSF sends billions to colleges and universities to support STEM education and nonmedical scientific research.\n\n\nNYTimes: White House Unveils New Details of Stark Budget Cuts\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/white-house-budget-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe White House budget is not a matter of law. Ultimately, it is up to Congress to determine the budget, and in recent years it has routinely discarded many of the president’s proposals.

But experts say it would increase corruption and threaten the nation’s health and economy.\n\n\nIn April, the Office of Personnel Management posted to the Federal Register a proposed rule “to increase career employee accountability” by allowing agencies to quickly remove from critical positions employees “who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.” That could include any employee with “substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking,” such as those involved in drafting funding opportunity announcements, evaluating grant applications and recommending or selecting grant recipients.\n\n\n\n\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION FY 2026 Budget Request to Congress\n\nhttps://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/00-NSF-FY26-CJ-Entire-Rollup.pdf\n\n(NSF PROGRAMS TO BROADEN PARTICIPATION (BP)) Total, Broadening Participation Programs FY24 appropriated: $1,613.85M FY26 (Request) $171.31M\n\n(That’s 10.6 percent of the good old days.

But in the case of Fulbright, the administration is acting unilaterally to nix awards for both American and foreign applicants that for decades have been selected jointly, effectively telling other countries that they don’t have final say in the spending of their own funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Dems Grill Trump’s Pick to Lead the Office for Civil Rights\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/sex-gender/2025/06/06/senate-dems-grill-trumps-pick-lead-civil-rights-office\n\n“This administration has fired more than half of the staff at OCR, and President Trump is now asking, in his budget, to slash that by $49 million next year, so explain to me how those firings and that funding cut will help reduce that backlog?

The startling accusations show how the Trump administration is wielding power in pursuit of its political agenda.\n\n\nIn a series of letters that have not been previously reported, the government also disclosed that it had a “cooperating witness” inside the student-run journal. That witness now works in the White House under Stephen Miller, the architect of the administration’s domestic policy agenda, Trump officials confirmed.\n\n\nBut the aggressive language in the letters from the Justice Department’s two top civil rights lawyers appeared to have overstated the allegations in pursuit of an additional way to punish Harvard. In that way, the episode fits a broader trend in how the administration is wielding federal investigatory powers to impose its political agenda.\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Argues Cutting Off Its Government Funding Is Wasteful\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/harvard-argues-cutting-off-its-government-funding-is-wasteful.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn a court filing on Monday, Harvard University painted a bleak picture for its research enterprise if the funding taken away by the Trump administration is not restored.\n\n\n“The harm would be severe and long lasting,” John H.

She said the government looked forward to being “fully informed of actions taken to ensure Columbia’s compliance with accreditation standards, including compliance with federal civil rights laws.”\n\n\nPresident Trump has described the accreditation process as his “secret weapon” to force ideological changes at universities. But the Trump administration does not have direct control over which universities are accredited. Instead, those decisions are made by nongovernmental organizations certified by the government, in a complex process meant to insulate universities from political interference.\n\n\nNo, Trump Is Not Pulling Columbia’s Accreditation. Here’s What You Need to Know.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/no-trump-is-not-pulling-columbias-accreditation-heres-what-you-need-to-know\n\nIn terms of individual colleges, the federal government has no direct authority to interpret an accreditor’s standards, said John R. Przypyszny, a lawyer who specializes in accreditation. So Trump alone can’t revoke Columbia’s accreditation, which would cut off access to federal financial aid.\n\n\nThe Education Department’s letter, sent Wednesday, argued that Columbia has violated the standards of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.\n\n\nBecause Columbia failed to adequately respond to antisemitic behavior during protests against the war in Gaza, the department’s Office for Civil Rights concluded last month, the institution has violated Title VI, which bars discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared Jewish ancestry. Therefore, the letter continues, Columbia “fails to meet the standards for accreditation,” the department said in a news release. In light of that, the department said, the Middle States Commission must require the university to “establish a plan to come into compliance.”\n\n\nNYTimes: To Bolster Columbia Inquiry, Prosecutor Likened Hamas Graffiti to Cross Burning\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/columbia-protester-hamas-cross.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Justice Department, intent on pursuing a criminal case against student protesters at Columbia University, argued that graffiti with a Hamas symbol outside the home of the school’s interim president threatened her life and was comparable to a racist cross burning, newly unsealed court documents show.\n\n\nThe photo showed graffiti in bright red paint on the building where the university president lived, with the words “free them all” and an inverted triangle.\n\n(How freeing protestors becomes pro-Hamas, I’ll leave for others, but the article mentions an accompanying instagram post.)\n\nThe records also underscore how determined the Trump administration was to press forward with a case judges viewed as weak. Justice Department leaders pushed for an investigation of a student group, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, but federal judges in New York rejected the administration’s efforts to get a search warrant four times, in what some veteran lawyers described as an unusually prolonged disagreement between federal prosecutors and the courts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is saw on bluesky this week\n\n\nIndiana’s governor fired all the elected members of Indiana University’s Board of Trustees.

Faculty were downgraded to “advisory only” roles in university decision-making. Degree programs that graduated too few students would be closed.\n\n\nAnd at Indiana University, whose flagship campus in Bloomington is ranked among the nation’s top 100 schools, the state’s governor was given new power over the school’s governing board.\n\n\nThe moves align with a conservative playbook to reduce faculty power on campuses perceived by many on the right as bastions of liberal thought. This year, several other Republican-led states passed laws requiring reviews for tenured faculty and the reorganization of programs at public institutions that have low enrollment.\n\n\nMany faculty members see the Indiana bill as an attack on their university’s independence and part of an effort to restrict their own freedom to teach and speak. They read Dr. Whitten’s [President of Indiana University] silence as support for the changes.\n\n\nIndiana’s experience has been emblematic of the pressures facing public universities. But several factors — an active protest movement on campus, a state with strong conservative leanings and Dr. Whitten herself, a leader at odds with many on her campus — have created especially tense conditions.\n\n\nDr. Whitten’s administration acted almost immediately. The university called in the Indiana State Police, which stationed snipers on rooftops and arrested 57 people, including a handful of faculty members.\n\n(Snipers!!!)\n\nDr. Whitten and the faculty have long had a frosty relationship. Earlier that spring, more than 800 faculty member approved a vote of no confidence in Dr. Whitten. (More than 3,000 were eligible to vote.)\n\n(Just to be fair, only 948 showed up to be possibly counted https://www.idsnews.com/article/2024/04/behind-the-vote-faculty-lost-confidence-whitten-administration)\n\n\n\n\nUniversities quietly negotiating with White House aide to try to avoid Harvard’s fate, source says | CNN Politics\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/politics/universities-negotiate-trump-administration-harvard\n(So says an anonymous source likely named Stephen Miller)\n\nCollege and university leaders have been privately negotiating with a deputy to top Trump aide Stephen Miller in hopes of avoiding the same aggressive targeting of Harvard University, a person familiar with the matter said, as the administration looks to escalate its attacks on the Ivy League institution and other schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s Attacks Threaten Much More Than Harvard - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/trump-harvard-higher-education-law/682985/\n\nBut the Trump administration’s attack didn’t end there. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s letter announcing this move also doubled as a request for documents, instructing Harvard to deliver five years of video or audio of “any protest activity involving a non-immigrant student,” plus disciplinary files, before the ban will be reconsidered. The next morning, Harvard sued and won a temporary restraining order.\n\n\nThe letter represents the Trump administration’s latest assault in its war on Harvard, in which the government is effectively trying to nationalize a private university.\n\n\nNYTimes: World Scientists Look Elsewhere as U.S. Labs Stagger Under Trump Cuts\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/world/asia/us-science-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFor many of the others, the political turmoil in Washington has dried up job opportunities in what Professor Ladher [professor at the National Center for Biological Sciences in Bangalore] calls “the best research ecosystem in the world.” Some decided they would now rather take their skills elsewhere, including Austria, Japan and Australia, while others opted to stay in India.\n\n\nNYTimes: Denying Visas to Chinese Students Could Backfire on America\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/business/china-student-visas-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFor the millions of Chinese who have studied in the United States, myself [ Li Yuan] included, it is a sobering and disheartening development.

One might add Mary Ann Glendon, the Harvard law professor and former ambassador to the Vatican, who in July was named the head of President Trump’s Commission on Unalienable Rights.\n\n\nThe radicals, on the other hand, were those who believed that American liberalism had always been deeply hostile to the core values of Catholics.\n\n\nHarvard Law professor Adrian Vermeule accused Deneen of failing to grapple fully with the consequences of his own diagnosis. … What was needed was not the creation of new societies — which would survive only at the forbearance of the reigning powers — but a coup against the liberal “imperium” from within. … Rather than withdrawing from the power centers of liberal society, Vermeule recommends that administrators and other elites find a “strategic position” from which, as dissatisfaction with liberalism grows, they can turn that bureaucracy to “new ends.”\n\n(Deenan also raises the ire of David Brooks:)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/opinion/trump-vance-morality.html\n\nParks, libraries, museums: here’s why Trump is attacking America’s best-loved institutions | Margaret Sullivan | The Guardian\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/02/national-parks-libraries-museums-trump\n\nIt seems counterintuitive, but this is all a part of a broad plan that the great 20th-century political thinker Hannah Arendt would have understood all too well.\n\n\nTake away natural beauty, free access to books and support for the arts, and you end up with a less enlightened, more ignorant and less engaged public. That’s a public much more easily manipulated.\n\n\n“A people that can no longer believe in anything cannot make up its mind,” said Arendt, a student of authoritarianism, in 1973. Eventually, such a public “is deprived … of its ability to think and judge”, and with people like that, “you can then do what you please”.",

The laws mandate that students take civics courses focused on Western civilization and bar classes centered on race or gender from counting toward core requirements.\n\n\nState lawmakers have the authority to regulate curriculums and set requirements for graduation, but higher education experts say that until recently, they have let public colleges and universities lead the way. That began to change in 2020 after the first Trump administration issued an executive order to stamp out “divisive concepts” about race and gender in the federal government, according to the American Association of University Professors and American Federation of Teachers.\n\n\n“This is a new type of local intervention,” said Keith E. Whittington, founding chair of the Academic Committee of the Academic Freedom Alliance. “Some of the proposals are making more elaborate interventions about what the curriculum ought to look like and are also increasingly interested in the content.”\n\n\nHouse Democrats Air Grievances With McMahon\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/05/mcmahon-faces-angry-house-democrats\n\nThe Trump administration has recently criticized what it sees as a lack of viewpoint diversity at Harvard University and demanded that the institution hire more conservative professors if it would like to regain access to federal grant funding. At a Senate hearing Tuesday, McMahon said a federal law that prevents discrimination based on race and national origin gave the department the authority to make such demands.\n\n\nTakano [California Democrat] snapped back, saying, “I think it’s pretty clear you haven’t thought through this idea of viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\nNYTimes: A Professor Was Fired for Her Politics. Is That the Future of Academia?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/magazine/academic-freedom-politics.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut that night, reading Kanazi’s words while taking in the news, she felt a pitch of fury and despair at the rising number of dead in Gaza and her sense that too few Americans were similarly horrified. She believed in her right to state her beliefs and share those of others, like Kanazi, with whom she sympathized. Besides, the post would disappear from her Instagram stories by the following evening.\n\n\nTwo days later, on a Friday, Finkelstein got an email from Jennifer Storm, the director of equity and Title IX at Muhlenberg, asking her to come to a meeting the following Monday — with a lawyer if she wanted one.\n\n\nBut the meeting, which took place a week later on Zoom with Finkelstein’s lawyer present, was entirely about her repost. Finkelstein was told not to return to campus and locked out of her email. Her classes would be reassigned to an adjunct professor while the college hired an outside firm to investigate.\n\n\nThe investigation stretched over the spring semester. Then, in May, Finkelstein received a new letter from the college: She was being fired, with cause. This despite her having tenure, a historic form of academic job protection meant to insulate scholars from the steamrolling power of both politics and public opinion. Less noticed at the time, but arguably more prophetic, was how the mechanics of her firing trammeled yet another longtime standard in the academy, that of professors’ deciding among themselves when and if a colleague should be fired.",

Then He Got in Trouble.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/brown-university-newspaper-musk-doge.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThousands of administrative employees at Brown University woke up this spring to an email with pointed Elon Musk-like questions about their job responsibilities.\n\n\nPlease describe your role, it asked. What tasks have you performed in the past week? How would Brown students be affected if your job didn’t exist?\n\n\nThe March 18 email was from a sophomore, Alex Shieh, who explained that the responses would be included in a story for The Brown Spectator, a new, as yet unpublished conservative newspaper on campus.\n\n\nTwo days later, Brown notified Mr. Shieh that he was under investigation for possible violations of the university’s code of student conduct, including its prohibitions on invasion of privacy, misrepresentation and emotional or psychological harm.\n\n\nWith that, his case — and that of two Spectator students who were later placed under investigation — became the latest flashpoint in the free speech wars on American college campuses.\n\n\nBrown eventually cleared all three students of wrongdoing. But their case is yet another example of how universities continue to struggle with protecting the rights of students to express themselves on campus, after years of trying to adjudicate just when political expression tips into harassment.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Attacks on Black History Betray America\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/opinion/black-history-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration’s framing of Black history as “D.E.I.” — and “D.E.I.” as harming white Americans — recasts its attack on Black history as protecting white Americans. As administering justice. Which is the justification of nearly every Klan and racist mob attack in history. The justification of the Atlanta attack in 1906.\n\n\nOpinion | Here are the people Trump is trying to delete\n\nhttps://wapo.st/3Hs6XZb\n(Sexism too)\n\nAbout 80 percent of the erased images contained one or more targeted keywords, such as gay, transgender, women, Hispanic and Black.\n\n\nEntire demographics are being scrubbed from records of both America’s past and present — including people of color, transgender people, women, immigrants and people with disabilities. They are now among America’s “missing persons.”\n\n\nPeople who aren’t White are an especially frequent target of government erasure.\n\n\nWomen (alongside racial minorities) have been disproportionately fired in purges of National Institutes of Health science review boards and senior military leadership positions. A landmark study on women’s health — the Women’s Health Initiative — was canceled entirely in April, though eventually restored after significant public outcry. The Labor Department likewise canceled grants for women’s apprenticeship programs last week.\n\n\nMore broadly, the terms “woman” and “women” have also appeared on banned-word lists for federal agency websites, grant applications and other external communications, including at the National Science Foundation and the Food and Drug Administration.",

Rubio did not clarify what fields could be considered critical, potentially setting the stage for a sweeping focus on areas where GOP lawmakers have raised concerns about sensitive national security research being shared with the Chinese government.\n\n\nAt a press conference yesterday, department spokesperson Tammy Bruce declined to “get into the details” of how the new visa scrutiny would be applied or what “critical fields” the department was referring to, because it “might give up our hand and make certain things less effective.”\n\n\n“‘Aggressively revoking’ visas based on political ideology is a gross violation of basic free expression principles that anchor the academy,” he [Jonathan Friedman, managing director of U.S. free expression at PEN America] wrote to Inside Higher Ed.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/colleges-across-u-s-fear-chill-on-enrollments-of-foreign-students\n\nThe visa-interview suspension capped a week of bad news: The nominee to oversee the student-visa system vowed to end work authorization for recent international graduates, a move that could seriously dent the appeal of American colleges. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned foreign students who had not updated their employment records that they could face deportation. And the Trump administration took the unprecedented step of revoking Harvard University’s authority to enroll international students as part of an all-fronts showdown with one of the nation’s most prestigious institutions. Other colleges could be next, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in announcing the decision: “Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country.”\n\n\nTrump administration claims Chinese students ‘exploit’ U.S. universities\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/01/china-us-students-national-security-threat/\n\nWhat the New Travel Ban Means for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-the-new-travel-ban-means-for-higher-ed\n\nAnd taken together, the two proclamations underscore the extent to which international students are simultaneously in the crosshairs of two of the most contentious and virulent issues of the Trump presidency, its opposition to immigration and its fight to force higher education to bend to government’s agenda.\n\n\nRestrictions on international students are a powerful lever to use against colleges, many of which have come to rely on the higher tuition paid by foreign students in a time of leaner budgets and domestic demographic declines. At the graduate level, visa holders are the backbone of American research and science.",

The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state on Wednesday over its policy of allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at public universities. Within hours, Texas sided with the Justice Department, and U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor granted a permanent injunction, quashing the policy.\n\n\nIn an interview before the permanent injunction, Ahilan Arulanantham, professor from practice at the UCLA School of Law and co-director of the law school’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said he didn’t believe a legal ruling in the Justice Department’s favor would necessarily affect other states, such as California, with similar laws. He said Texas used a residency criterion to decide eligibility for in-state tuition, an approach more vulnerable to legal challenges than some of the criteria other states use.\n\n\nBut even if other states go unscathed, losing in-state tuition benefits is “extraordinarily significant” for the “massive” undocumented population in Texas, he said.",

And that’s not the only shake-up happening at the NSF, which Congress created in 1950 to “promote the progress of science; advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; and secure the national defense.” The Trump administration has also laid off staff and proposed slashing the agency’s budget.\n\n\nAdditionally, NSF announced new priorities that include not funding projects aimed at recruiting more Americans from underrepresented backgrounds to the STEM workforce—a key focus for the agency historically.\n\n\nThe Trump administration says all these changes are part of its plan to reform the NSF, correct an alleged “scientific slowdown,” build a “a robust domestic STEM workforce” and “rapidly accelerate its investment in critical and advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology.” The NSF sends billions to colleges and universities to support STEM education and nonmedical scientific research.\n\n\nNYTimes: White House Unveils New Details of Stark Budget Cuts\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/white-house-budget-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe White House budget is not a matter of law. Ultimately, it is up to Congress to determine the budget, and in recent years it has routinely discarded many of the president’s proposals. Lawmakers are only starting to embark on the annual process, with government funding set to expire at the end of September.\n\n\nTargeting the Education Department, the president again put forward a roughly $12 billion cut, seeking to eliminate dozens of programs while unveiling new changes to Pell grants, which help low-income students pay for college.\n\n\nThe maximum award would be capped at $5,710 for the 2026-7 award year, a decrease of more than $1,600.\n\n\nMr. Trump and his budget director, Russell T. Vought, “are clearly hiding their policy goals, because they would hurt the middle class, the working class and the vulnerable,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, who leads her party on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\n\nNew Details of Trump’s Budget Cuts Alarm Researchers\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/03/new-details-trumps-budget-cuts-alarm-researchers\n\nTrump Wants Grant Makers to Become Political Appointees\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/05/trump-policy-moves-make-grant-makers-political\n\nOfficials say the policy, which would make it easier to fire thousands of government employees, is designed to increase accountability. But experts say it would increase corruption and threaten the nation’s health and economy.\n\n\nIn April, the Office of Personnel Management posted to the Federal Register a proposed rule “to increase career employee accountability” by allowing agencies to quickly remove from critical positions employees “who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.” That could include any employee with “substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking,” such as those involved in drafting funding opportunity announcements, evaluating grant applications and recommending or selecting grant recipients.\n\n\n\n\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION FY 2026 Budget Request to Congress\n\nhttps://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/00-NSF-FY26-CJ-Entire-Rollup.pdf\n\n(NSF PROGRAMS TO BROADEN PARTICIPATION (BP)) Total, Broadening Participation Programs FY24 appropriated: $1,613.85M FY26 (Request) $171.31M\n\n(That’s 10.6 percent of the good old days.

The startling accusations show how the Trump administration is wielding power in pursuit of its political agenda.\n\n\nIn a series of letters that have not been previously reported, the government also disclosed that it had a “cooperating witness” inside the student-run journal. That witness now works in the White House under Stephen Miller, the architect of the administration’s domestic policy agenda, Trump officials confirmed.\n\n\nBut the aggressive language in the letters from the Justice Department’s two top civil rights lawyers appeared to have overstated the allegations in pursuit of an additional way to punish Harvard.

She said the government looked forward to being “fully informed of actions taken to ensure Columbia’s compliance with accreditation standards, including compliance with federal civil rights laws.”\n\n\nPresident Trump has described the accreditation process as his “secret weapon” to force ideological changes at universities. But the Trump administration does not have direct control over which universities are accredited. Instead, those decisions are made by nongovernmental organizations certified by the government, in a complex process meant to insulate universities from political interference.\n\n\nNo, Trump Is Not Pulling Columbia’s Accreditation. Here’s What You Need to Know.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/no-trump-is-not-pulling-columbias-accreditation-heres-what-you-need-to-know\n\nIn terms of individual colleges, the federal government has no direct authority to interpret an accreditor’s standards, said John R. Przypyszny, a lawyer who specializes in accreditation. So Trump alone can’t revoke Columbia’s accreditation, which would cut off access to federal financial aid.\n\n\nThe Education Department’s letter, sent Wednesday, argued that Columbia has violated the standards of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.\n\n\nBecause Columbia failed to adequately respond to antisemitic behavior during protests against the war in Gaza, the department’s Office for Civil Rights concluded last month, the institution has violated Title VI, which bars discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared Jewish ancestry. Therefore, the letter continues, Columbia “fails to meet the standards for accreditation,” the department said in a news release. In light of that, the department said, the Middle States Commission must require the university to “establish a plan to come into compliance.”\n\n\nNYTimes: To Bolster Columbia Inquiry, Prosecutor Likened Hamas Graffiti to Cross Burning\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/columbia-protester-hamas-cross.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Justice Department, intent on pursuing a criminal case against student protesters at Columbia University, argued that graffiti with a Hamas symbol outside the home of the school’s interim president threatened her life and was comparable to a racist cross burning, newly unsealed court documents show.\n\n\nThe photo showed graffiti in bright red paint on the building where the university president lived, with the words “free them all” and an inverted triangle.\n\n(How freeing protestors becomes pro-Hamas, I’ll leave for others, but the article mentions an accompanying instagram post.)\n\nThe records also underscore how determined the Trump administration was to press forward with a case judges viewed as weak. Justice Department leaders pushed for an investigation of a student group, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, but federal judges in New York rejected the administration’s efforts to get a search warrant four times, in what some veteran lawyers described as an unusually prolonged disagreement between federal prosecutors and the courts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is saw on bluesky this week\n\n\nIndiana’s governor fired all the elected members of Indiana University’s Board of Trustees.

Faculty were downgraded to “advisory only” roles in university decision-making. Degree programs that graduated too few students would be closed.\n\n\nAnd at Indiana University, whose flagship campus in Bloomington is ranked among the nation’s top 100 schools, the state’s governor was given new power over the school’s governing board.\n\n\nThe moves align with a conservative playbook to reduce faculty power on campuses perceived by many on the right as bastions of liberal thought. This year, several other Republican-led states passed laws requiring reviews for tenured faculty and the reorganization of programs at public institutions that have low enrollment.\n\n\nMany faculty members see the Indiana bill as an attack on their university’s independence and part of an effort to restrict their own freedom to teach and speak. They read Dr. Whitten’s [President of Indiana University] silence as support for the changes.\n\n\nIndiana’s experience has been emblematic of the pressures facing public universities. But several factors — an active protest movement on campus, a state with strong conservative leanings and Dr. Whitten herself, a leader at odds with many on her campus — have created especially tense conditions.\n\n\nDr. Whitten’s administration acted almost immediately. The university called in the Indiana State Police, which stationed snipers on rooftops and arrested 57 people, including a handful of faculty members.\n\n(Snipers!!!)\n\nDr. Whitten and the faculty have long had a frosty relationship. Earlier that spring, more than 800 faculty member approved a vote of no confidence in Dr. Whitten. (More than 3,000 were eligible to vote.)\n\n(Just to be fair, only 948 showed up to be possibly counted https://www.idsnews.com/article/2024/04/behind-the-vote-faculty-lost-confidence-whitten-administration)\n\n\n\n\nUniversities quietly negotiating with White House aide to try to avoid Harvard’s fate, source says | CNN Politics\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/politics/universities-negotiate-trump-administration-harvard\n(So says an anonymous source likely named Stephen Miller)\n\nCollege and university leaders have been privately negotiating with a deputy to top Trump aide Stephen Miller in hopes of avoiding the same aggressive targeting of Harvard University, a person familiar with the matter said, as the administration looks to escalate its attacks on the Ivy League institution and other schools.",

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s letter announcing this move also doubled as a request for documents, instructing Harvard to deliver five years of video or audio of “any protest activity involving a non-immigrant student,” plus disciplinary files, before the ban will be reconsidered. The next morning, Harvard sued and won a temporary restraining order.\n\n\nThe letter represents the Trump administration’s latest assault in its war on Harvard, in which the government is effectively trying to nationalize a private university.\n\n\nNYTimes: World Scientists Look Elsewhere as U.S. Labs Stagger Under Trump Cuts\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/world/asia/us-science-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFor many of the others, the political turmoil in Washington has dried up job opportunities in what Professor Ladher [professor at the National Center for Biological Sciences in Bangalore] calls “the best research ecosystem in the world.” Some decided they would now rather take their skills elsewhere, including Austria, Japan and Australia, while others opted to stay in India.\n\n\nNYTimes: Denying Visas to Chinese Students Could Backfire on America\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/business/china-student-visas-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFor the millions of Chinese who have studied in the United States, myself [ Li Yuan] included, it is a sobering and disheartening development.

In late February, he posted on Bluesky that such cuts would damage biomedical research and prompt an exodus of talent from the United States.

Further delaying grants is another new requirement: NIH staff must check to ensure the recipient isn’t on the list of colleges and universities that have drawn Trump’s wrath, including Columbia, Harvard, Northwestern, Brown and Cornell.\n\n\nAt the State Department, employees are spending hours combing through official documents to remove the words “diverse,” equitable” and “inclusive,” said a staffer there, months after Trump issued his executive order ending diversity efforts.\n\n\nNYTimes: Candidate Criticized Over Diversity Blocked From Becoming U. of Florida President\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/us/santa-ono-university-of-florida-president.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Hard to feel sorry for the player, but this empowers Chris Rufo even more…)\n\nPaul Renner, a member of the Board of Governors who voted against Mr. Ono’s confirmation, said in an interview on Tuesday that Mr. Ono had led a university that embraced diversity, equity and inclusion programming.

The administration has paused $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania amid an investigation into its athletics policies. And it temporarily paused more than $100 million in funding to the University of Maine system after the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, said she would not observe the president’s executive order on transgender athletes, which does not carry the force of law.\n\n\nNYTimes: Professors Pushed Harvard to Resist Trump.

The administration has paused $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania amid an investigation into its athletics policies. And it temporarily paused more than $100 million in funding to the University of Maine system after the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, said she would not observe the president’s executive order on transgender athletes, which does not carry the force of law.\n\n\nNYTimes: Professors Pushed Harvard to Resist Trump. Now Billions Are on the Line.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/republicans-harvard-funding.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(NY Times blaming the victims in the headline…again)\n\n“The sharks circle when they smell blood in the water,” said Kenneth Roth, a former director of Human Rights Watch and a fellow at Harvard, who wants Harvard to fight better to allow robust debate and academic freedom.\n\n\n“That every-man-for-themselves response is about to cost us our democracy,” said Dr. Levitsky, who studies authoritarian regimes.\n\n\nAs President Trump’s inauguration approached, Harvard hired Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep ties to Mr. Trump. On the first full day of the Trump presidency, the university announced it was adopting a highly debated definition of antisemitism — which labels certain criticisms of Israel, such as calling its existence racist, as antisemitic — a move encouraged by the new administration but slammed by free speech advocates.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Pauses Dozens of Federal Grants to Princeton\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/trump-federal-grants-princeton.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration moved this week to suspend dozens of federal grants to Princeton University, the fourth Ivy League school that has seen its financial support from Washington reduced or explicitly threatened since March.\n\n\nAccording to Princeton’s most recent financial report, the university received more than $455 million through government grants and contracts during the fiscal year that ended in June 2024. That money accounted for roughly 18 percent of the university’s revenues.\n\n\nWho Is on Trump’s Antisemitism Task Force?\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/02/who-trumps-antisemitism-task-force?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed&utm_campaign=d776e1ff03-DNU_2021_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1fcbc04421-d776e1ff03-197464749&mc_cid=d776e1ff03&mc_eid=50634a26f0\n\nStaff and Funding Cuts at the NEH Loom\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/03/staff-and-funding-cuts-neh-loom\n\nHumanities advocates don’t know exactly how large the cuts to NEH’s approximately 180-person staff or $78.25 million grant budget will be, but they note that “patterns at other agencies” provide a solid hint.

The N.I.H. — the largest public funder of biomedical and behavioral research in the world — announced it would slash funding to universities for overhead, or indirect, costs, which often covers laboratories’ operational needs. …The agency has lost nearly one-fourth of its 18,000 employees because of job cuts, buyouts and some employees’ choosing early retirement, according to reporting by NPR.\n\n\nNYTimes: I Led Harvard’s Medical School, and I Fear for What’s to Come\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/opinion/harvard-medicine-higher-education.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Sends Harvard a List of Demands to Protect Federal Funds\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/trump-harvard-funding-demands.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn both instances, the government asked Harvard and Columbia to impose bans, with few exemptions, on masking.\n\n\nThe Trump administration also pressured the universities to intensify efforts to hold student groups “accountable,” cease admissions practices based on race, color or national origin and revamp policies on campus protests.\n\n\nit said that Harvard’s “programs and departments that fuel antisemitic harassment must be reviewed and necessary changes made to address bias, improve viewpoint diversity, and end ideological capture.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Set to Pause $510 Million for Brown University\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/trump-administration-brown-university-funding-pause.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThis adds Brown to the list that includes now: Columbia, Princeton, Harvard, UPenn",

It’s troubling and quite scary.”\n\n\nAs in so many other ways, however, Trump’s second term is a whole different beast. The president believes there has been a “concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our nation’s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth”, according to the White House executive order.\n\n\n400 Books Removed From Naval Academy Library\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/03/400-books-removed-naval-academy-library\n\nThat list included The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr., Einstein on Race and Racism, and a biography of Jackie Robinson.

    "text": "Dear All,\nPlease find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.\nThanks JC and BE for contributions this week.\nQuote of the week:\n\nthe Trump administration isn’t your garden-variety conservative. The attacks they have unleashed on higher education are of historic proportion. What they’re putting on the table resembles an extinction event for the sector. So we have to fight for the survival of higher education. [AAUP President]\n\n\n\n\nNO KINGS in New York City 10/18 12-2\n\nhttps://www.mobilize.us/nokings/event/838831/\n\n\n\n\nScholars at Risk US Mid-Atlantic Regional Conference\n\nhttps://www.scholarsatrisk.org/event/sar-us-midatlantic-conference/\n(Thanks BE for sharing)\n\nThe event, titled “Working Together to Protect Scholars and Promote Academic Freedom,” will feature SAR programming on both local and global responses to pressures on academic freedom. The meeting will offer networking opportunities, reflections on responses to attacks on higher education in both the US and worldwide, the launch of SAR’s Free to Think 2025 report, and most notably, the launch of SAR’s 25th Anniversary year themed “Truth Matters.”\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: The Trump Vengeance Tour Is Coming to a Stadium Near You\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/opinion/media-trump-ellison-murdoch-kirk.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Not so much about higher education, but a recommended read.)\n\n“Donald Trump’s goal,” Larry Diamond, a fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, wrote by email, “is to create a Hungarian-style pseudo-democracy, in which he and his movement can rule indefinitely through unfree and unfair elections and utter dominance of the media and civil society landscapes, while still claiming that they are the democratic embodiment of the ‘will of the people.’”\n\n\n“Everything Trump has been doing of late follows that authoritarian playbook of trying to eviscerate checks and balances, eliminate independent oversight actors, and use state power to punish and terrify critics, so they will self-censor. He is even going after the same philanthropy — the Open Society Foundations — that Orban went after.”\n\n\nTrump’s favorability ratings have fallen from 50.5 percent during his first week in office this year to 46.1 percent on Sept. 22, but that has not deterred him. Just the opposite: Trump, his vice president, his aides and his cabinet members initiate daily attacks on the left, some illegal, some unfounded, but all damaging and costly.\n\n\nTrump’s actions, Westwood [a political scientist at Dartmouth] wrote, “are now escalating into a direct assault on the institutional infrastructure of the left.” However, Westwood continued. “this is more than a rhetorical move; threatening the 501(c)(3) status of these foundations aims to choke off the financial lifeblood of a vast network of opposition groups, effectively criminalizing dissent.”\n\n\nGoldstone [professor of public policy at George Mason]: We are now a country in which people can lose their jobs for making the wrong joke; where universities, media, and law firms have to defend themselves against lawsuits and investigations that threaten to bankrupt them; where people in America (even American citizens) can be rounded up, arrested, and put in detention if they have the wrong accent or work at the wrong kind of job, and where masked ICE agents and uniformed national military patrol the streets of our major cities.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Title VI, Discrimination, and Academic Freedom\n\nhttps://www.aaup.org/reports-publications/aaup-policies-reports/topical-reports/title-vi-discrimination-and-academic?link_id=1&can_id=7972d9c8790a906a068fba11ce31c6a1&source=email-new-report-on-title-vi-out-today&email_referrer=email_2898804&email_subject=new-report-on-title-vi-out-today&&\n(Thank ET for sharing this most necessary critique of the current abuse of Title VI evaluation. This is a long, worthwhile read that I hope to summarize in blog format. For now, here are a few of the recommendations.)\n\n\nFaculties, administrations, and governing boards must refuse to comply with unlawful federal government demands based on Title VI investigations that impinge on institutional autonomy, faculty academic freedom (including the faculty’s role in governance), student academic freedom, and freedom of expression of faculty members, students, and staff.\n\n\n\n\nAdministrations and governing boards must publicly affirm their commitment to defending academic freedom—defined as the protection of teaching, research, and intramural and extramural speech—and support faculty members under attack.\n\n\n\n\nAdministrations and governing boards must respect the importance of faculty involvement in shared governance processes when creating or changing institutional policies and in determining responses to governmental demands for information or institutional actions. They must entertain faculty resolutions that protect unpopular teaching and research as well as controversial speech and forms of expressive activity.\n\n\n\n\nFaculties, administrations, and governing boards must not engage in anticipatory obedience, including by eliminating programs; scrubbing websites; removing particular words or phrases from syllabi, course materials, and course titles and descriptions; or reporting on community members—faculty members, staff, or students— whose political speech or intellectual work may make them targets for governmental discipline or deportation. Pressure from politicians, donors, and trustees must be resisted because it creates a slippery slope for other forms of censorship and control.\n\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/23/aaup-accuses-trump-weaponizing-civil-rights-law\n\nIs the AAUP Too Partisan? Its President Doesn’t Think So.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/is-the-aaup-too-partisan-its-president-doesnt-think-so\n\n“We’re taking it to the courts and the streets — and we need you.” So reads the subject line of an April email from the American Association of University Professors, authored by its president, Todd Wolfson.\n\n\nThe sentence encapsulates the 110-year-old membership organization’s approach to the second Trump presidency. It has filed lawsuits challenging the administration’s aggressive higher-ed agenda — most recently to contest what it called the “attempt to unlawfully stifle free speech” within the University of California system. Wolfson has advocated for a vigorous defense of the sector, saying in a recent interview that (nonviolent) “militant job actions” may be necessary.\n\n\nBefore the presidential election, Wolfson, who is on leave from his job as an associate professor of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University’s New Brunswick campus, called then-vice presidential candidate JD Vance a “fascist” — a judgment he’s not backed away from since.\n\n\nThe courts are an important place to try to stop the Trump administration’s attempt to illegally refashion higher education to mirror, or at least lean towards, the ideological leanings of the Trump administration, which I would say are radically right-wing leanings. We do not think that lawsuits are enough, but they’re one critical tool.\n\n\nThe next ruling we expect is the AAUP v. [Secretary of State Marco] Rubio ruling. Our hope is that it will be really clear that people like President Trump or Secretary of State Rubio will not be allowed to threaten deportation because of the political speech of students or faculty or staff. That lawsuit is meant to protect the freedom of speech of people in our sector.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, they [general decline in public trust] exist because people like Ron DeSantis [Florida’s Republican governor] and Chris Rufo, [a right-wing anti-DEI activist], have been speaking very loudly, unfairly disparaging higher education for a very long time, without the appropriate response from higher-education workers, higher-education institutions. We’ve heard a message from a radical right-wing regime that is attempting to smear higher education, and doing a good job of it. So of course if they are over and over putting out a negative message about higher ed, then people are going to consume that message, and there hasn’t been a response to that message that’s been effective.\n\n\nWe’re an economic engine. We’re a health-care engine. We’re a technological-innovation engine. And there’s one more thing that I really think is important to remind ourselves of: Kids go to college so that they can get a job and imagine that they’re going to do a little bit better than their parents. Skyrocketing tuition and skyrocketing student debt have made it so that higher education is a difficult choice for students. AAUP believes that public higher education should be free, and so we want to fight for that. We have plenty of money to do that. We have plenty of billionaires who now are becoming trillionaires that can help us pay for this, if the most wealthy are taxed a bit more.\n\n\nNo, I don’t think ‘progressive.’ What AAUP defines itself as is an organization that believes that higher education should be a common public good for everyone. We align ourselves with the vast majority of Americans of any political stripe who need education for their kids, their families, in order to move forward in this country.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, the Trump administration isn’t your garden-variety conservative. The attacks they have unleashed on higher education are of historic proportion. What they’re putting on the table resembles an extinction event for the sector. So we have to fight for the survival of higher education.\n\n\nSo you’re saying to me AAUP is partisan, because the Trump administration is slapping higher ed and we’re standing up and fighting back? No. No. We are standing for what we always stood for, which is a powerful higher-education sector that leads to innovation and social mobility and is a bedrock of democracy.\n\n\nIt’s them — the radical right wing — that is politicizing higher ed. We will not shrink from that. If people have a problem with that, then they can get in line with Trump and Chris Rufo, and that’s fine. But we are gonna stand up for our institutions, and we are gonna be proud and loud about it.\n\n\nThe AAUP has a very clear agenda. We are going to fight over the budget right now and try to get fully funded NIH [National Institutes of Health], NSF [National Science Foundation], NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]. We are going to fight to make sure that the TRIO program, which supports first-generation college kids, is fully enshrined in this budget. … Then we are going to pivot from there and put out a proactive vision for the future of higher education.\n\n\n\n\n\nAngelo State May Ban Pride Flags, Pronouns and Preferred Names\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/09/24/angelo-state-reportedly-banning-pride-flags\n\nEmployees at Angelo State University in Texas could be fired for displaying a pride flag or discussing any topic that suggests there are more gender identities than male and female.\n\n\nSpokespeople for Angelo State have not confirmed or denied details of the policies reportedly discussed at meetings Monday between faculty, staff and institutional leaders. But, local news magazine the Concho Observer reported that the policies would ban discussion of transgender topics or any topics that suggest there are more than two genders.\n\n(Also, which says this is a done deal)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-public-university-in-texas-bans-discussion-of-transgender-topics-in-class\n\nAngelo State Allows LGBQ Discussions, Holds Firm on Anti-Trans Policies\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/25/angelo-state-allows-pride-flags-keeps-anti-trans-policies\n\nAs of Monday, conversations and content about transgender identities are still prohibited, but employees are allowed to use students’ preferred names, display rainbow flags in their offices and on their cars, and talk about lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer identities, according to emails from department heads to faculty obtained by Inside Higher Ed.\n\n\nNone of the policies are formalized in writing, and that is purposeful, said Brian Evans, president of the Texas Conference of the American Association of University Professors. The guidance only changed after faculty brought up questions about the policies, which deans took back to the provost and university counsel. Final details about what is and is not allowed and how the rules will be enforced are still under discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\nConservative are targeting speech. More teachers may lose their jobs. - The Washington Post\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/09/20/conservatives-target-teachers-free-speech/\n\nA day after a video of the exchange began circulating [Texas A&M Children’s Literature class], the instructor was fired, the department head and dean were removed from their posts, and the Justice Department said it would look into the matter. Ten days later, as cries from the right continued to echo across the internet, the university president said he was resigning, bringing the tenure of a retired four-star general to an unexpected and abrupt halt.\n\n\nNow the state lawmaker who led the campaign against them says he’s being inundated with tips about what he characterized as offensive efforts to indoctrinate students. “This is just the start,” Texas state Rep. Brian Harrison, a conservative firebrand, told The Washington Post. “I hope this puts the fear of God into every university president and chancellor in Texas.”\n\n\nOver the past several years, conservatives have focused on reshaping teachings of race, gender identity and sexual orientation, leading to a spate of state laws regulating what educators can say and to the firing of a number of teachers. That campaign mushroomed this month as conservatives pushed to oust people they say have gone too far in criticizing Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist who was fatally shot at Utah Valley University last week.\n\n\nSo far, the Texas Education Agency has received 281 complaints about teacher comments in the wake of Kirk’s killing, with staff still reviewing them, spokeswoman Jake Kobersky said Friday. He said the agency had not yet punished any of these teachers, though some districts have acted and the state might step in as well.\n\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said she sees no end in sight to the scrutiny of teachers’ speech. Kirk’s killing was horrible, she said, but does not justify going after teachers who have a diversity of opinions.\n\n\nNYTimes: The Firing of Educators Over Kirk Comments Follows a Familiar Playbook\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/us/firing-educators-kirk-free-speech.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(With background on Brooklyn College’s non-reappointment of four adjunct faculty members for “conduct”)\n\nThe American Association of University Professors, an organization founded to defend academic freedom, said it was aware of retaliation against about 60 professors and teachers in connection with critical comments they made about Mr. Kirk or people mourning him.\n\n\nFaculty First Responders, an organization that works with the association to advise educators who are the victim of doxxing and harassment campaigns, has reached out to 35 academic workers in the past week, most of them professors, whose comments about Mr. Kirk have been spread in right-wing media, according to Heather Steffen, the group’s director.\n\n\nThe Texas Education Agency has said it is investigating hundreds of employees at elementary or secondary schools for similar reasons.\n\n\nIf they choose to mount a legal fight, fired employees of public institutions, which are bound by the First Amendment, probably have better chances of prevailing in court than those fired from private institutions.\n\n\nProponents of academic freedom see the current crackdown on professors as an assault on freedom of expression that echoes dark periods in American history. At Brooklyn College, where four adjunct professors were dismissed this year for their pro-Palestinian activism, a faculty union called the movement to curb educators’ speech the “New McCarthyism.”\n\n\nOne of the four, Corinna Mullin, who was an adjunct professor of political science, said that recent developments show that academic freedom is not a universal right but a conditional privilege.\n\n\n“And it seems that it’s granted or withdrawn based on the context of our speech — those who echo power are shielded,” said Dr. Mullin, who was arrested during a police raid on a Gaza Solidarity encampment at City College in 2024. Trespassing charges against her were later dropped.\n\n\nShe said she believed that activists on the right will continue to expand their attacks to take in “all speech on the left associated with social justice, racial justice, all these uncomfortable truths that challenge power in this country.”\n\n\nIn several instances, Mr. Kirk has used the First Amendment to sue universities that tried to block his organization’s campus presence.\n\n\nBut critics have argued that Mr. Kirk’s promotion of free speech was riddled with hypocrisy. Matthew Boedy, a professor at the University of North Georgia who has written a book that focuses heavily on Mr. Kirk, “The Seven Mountains Mandate,” called Mr. Kirk’s stance “an empty support of free speech.”\n\n\nProfessor in court fight over Charlie Kirk post is temporarily reinstated\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/09/25/charlie-kirk-shooting-professor-south-dakota/\n\nA federal court on Wednesday temporarily reinstated a University of South Dakota professor [a tenured art professor that described Kirk on facebook as a “hate spreading Nazi.” ]who was put on administrative leave after making negative comments on social media about Charlie Kirk on the same day that the conservative activist was shot.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/26/court-order-reinstates-sd-prof-fired-kirk-comments\n\n\n\nNYTimes Gift Article: The Grand Strategy Behind Trump’s Crackdown on Academia\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/opinion/trump-academia-victim-may-mailman.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ok8.sM5c.tGhv1r82oHx-&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(hard-to-get-through interview with Mary Mailman the right hand person behind Stephen Miller’s attempted assault on higher education, though the interviewer, Ross Douhat, doesn’t bother to bring that up…)\n\nDouthat: What is wrong with the American university? Mailman: I don’t think it’s every university, but I would say the biggest one that comes for me is a culture of victimhood — a glorification of victimhood — that is ultimately bad for Western civilization and bad for the country.\n\n\nMailman: It’s not necessarily that they are victims but that they should be victims. That it’s good to be a victim. That in admissions, what is it better to be? It’s better to be in a minority class, whether that’s a sexual minority class, whether that’s a racial minority class. There’s something better to being underrepresented, to being somehow downtrodden, that should be treated as preferential or better.\n\n\nbut the whole idea of treating people differently based on whether they are oppressed or oppressors, and if it’s seen as Meghan Markle — why does she want to appear like a victim?\n\n\nMailman: Yeah, there is an executive order that discusses universities. Specifically, Title VI says that for any federally funded educational institution, they can’t discriminate on the basis of race or national origin. This has been used both on the antisemitism front, which is national origin and race, and then also on what people broadly describe as the D.E.I. front. And so if you’re going to be federally funded, then we’re going to make sure that you don’t discriminate on the basis of race.\n\n\nDouthat: Pause there for a moment. First of all, how did you pick which schools you sent letters to?\n\n\nMailman: So I think we primarily relied on the Department of Education to pick what they either knew, based on complaints that have been received, and you had House investigations. A lot of this information was public, here and there. It was in government databases. Some of them are just very out loud, like the U.C. system. So I think there was some flag waving by certain universities.\n\n\nDouthat: I mean, also, the federal government doesn’t actually have the power to shut down Harvard University.\n\n\nMailman: No, but in theory —\n\n\nDouthat: But you can defund Harvard.\n\n\nMailman: Right. And what’s Harvard’s special thing? It is that it’s, in theory, a leader, and the question is: A leader in what direction?\n\n\nMailman: Right, and that’s always an option. If anybody thinks that any of this is too burdensome, especially very well-funded universities, then just do none of it. Just be Hillsdale. And it’s funny, because for research — I mean, people don’t really understand the massive amount of money that goes to research. It’s billions and billions. Harvard right now has something like $7 billion of promised grants. These are huge, huge numbers. But if all of the research was good, something that was going to cure cancer, then a donor would love to fund that. I mean, to be the person that cured cancer?\n\n\nThe problem is not whether the government should or shouldn’t be funding cancer research — it absolutely should — but the unwieldiness of it has led to basically an unchecked situation. I think it is actually proper to have a right sizing, where universities are relying on the federal government to a certain extent, where these are things that are maybe not close to a breakthrough and that there is an opportunity for the private sector to spend money in ways that are beneficial to society.\n\n\nMailman: Wealthy people funding universities, funding science, funding our future is something that has history in this country.\n\n\nSo I think there’s a recognition. It’s all — of course, there’s no recognition of fault. These are settlements. But by paying some of this back, I think there is, somewhat for the public, a sense of acknowledgment of wrongdoing. Not a legal sense but sort of a moral sense\n\n(Really, not sure that is how the payee feels)\n\nNot only that, but to the extent you have universities that are just hotbeds of radicalism, that’s not good for the student. That’s not good for the culture. That’s not good for the campus. That’s bad for the country. So that is all true. And I think the administration believes that intellectual diversity is a key factor to a good university that we would send our kids to.\n\n\nDouthat: I think that’s right, just based on my own experience living in a college town and speaking to people who work in higher education. There is some degree, first, to which the Trump administration is pushing on an open door and also some degree to which leaders of universities are happy to say, “Oh, we didn’t want to do this, but the Trump administration made us do it,” but in fact, it’s something that they themselves want to do.\n\n(I could keep going here, but the whole interview is just too much, though I can’t resist adding this)\n\nMailman: It’s not a full comparison of all universities across the nation. But at the end of the day, Harvard reacted to a letter that asked for a few simple changes with a lawsuit that basically said: Instead of us showing any amount of good faith effort to commit ourselves to the policies that are important to the United States, we’re going to instead say we refuse to even answer you. These are billions of federal dollars, and I think that the funder of that can ask for a basic relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre CUNY visa applicants being told no?\n\nReports from one CC are that of 192 new international student admissions 92 were denied.\n\nTrump administration to add $100,000 fee for H-1B visas - CBS News\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-h1b-visa-bill-100000-fee/\n(This is hopefully going to be found illegal, because otherwise it will seriously impact faculty hiring.)\n\nThe Trump administration is adding $100,000 to the existing fee for H-1B visa applications, taking aim at a program that is used to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S.\n\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order late Friday adding the new visa application fee and barring H-1B workers from entering the U.S. unless they had made the $100,000 payment.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/trump-h-1b-visas-fee.html\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-trumps-100-000-fee-for-skilled-worker-visas-could-mean-for-higher-ed\n\nInternational-student enrollment is sagging at many U.S. universities, particularly at the master’s level\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/international-student-enrollment-decline-college-ad13f943?st=FSLVfk&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nInternational-student enrollment is sagging at many universities, particularly at the master’s level. School officials cite the Trump administration’s summer pause on visa appointments followed by increased scrutiny of applicants, along with other policies aimed at shrinking the number of international students. Some say shifts in the technology job market are also decreasing demand abroad for certain graduate programs.\n\n\nThe U.S. enrolled a record 1.1 million international students in 2023-24—who contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy through tuition, food and living expenses, according to NAFSA: Association of International Educators.\n\n\n“I feel I’m now in the middle of nowhere,” said Elham Shamiri, an Iranian citizen who has been trying to obtain a visa to start a Ph.D. program in chemistry at the University of Vermont. She and hundreds of other Iranians have been asking politicians to carve out an exception for students with admissions offers. “We have nothing to do with politics,” Shamiri said, and shouldn’t be conflated with terrorism. “We are just students truly committed to research.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/09/23/international-enrollment-down-small-regional\n\n\n\nUnder Trump, NSF faces worst crisis in its 75-year history | Science | AAAS\n\nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/under-trump-nsf-faces-worst-crisis-its-75-year-history\n\nThe White House has ordered the $9 billion agency to abandon long-running programs, terminate more than 2000 grants, and reverse decisions on what to fund next based on the administration’s political agenda, which excludes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts and climate change research. NSF is also making radical changes in its daily operations, including sharply reducing its reliance on top academic scientists on loan from their institutions and realigning the agency’s entire grantmaking apparatus to conform to Trump’s priorities (see sidebar, below).\n\n\nMany science policy experts say those changes move NSF away from its founding principles, laid out in a 1945 report to then-President Harry Truman, to maintain U.S. leadership in science by funding the best ideas across all fields and training the next generation of researchers. That compares with the more targeted missions of most government agencies, such as advancing energy, health, or space exploration. But both of NSF’s goals, as put forward by Vannevar Bush in his seminal report that led to NSF’s creation in 1950, have lost support under Trump.\n\n\n“This administration doesn’t buy the idea that the government’s investment in basic research buys us anything useful,” one former senior NSF official says. “And if they don’t agree with Bush’s assumption, then why bother to even have an NSF?”\n\n\nKeivan Stassun, who was named to NSB in January 2023, sees DOGE operating as the ultimate decision-maker at NSF, in tandem with the White House Office of Management and Budget. And OMB, he says, has discarded NSF’s well-regarded system of choosing the most worthy proposals. “If OMB is using anything like NSF’s merit review criteria,” says Stassun, an astrophysicist at Vanderbilt University, “that has not been communicated and is certainly not apparent to me.”\n\n\nFor more than 4 decades, NSF has supported a network of institutes that bring together top mathematicians and rising stars for in-person workshops to explore a range of hot topics and spark new areas of research. “The math institutes are the crown jewels of our portfolio,” says mathematician Juan Meza, former director of NSF’s math division, which spends roughly 15% of its annual budget on the network. “They support the entire mathematical community.”\n\n\nThe Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) has been part of that network since 2000 and is known for bridging the gap between academia and industry by working on problems that appeal to both theoretical and applied mathematicians. … On 27 July, NSF issued an embargoed press release announcing it would fund seven institutes in the network, including IPAM, which would get another $17 million over the next 5 years. But when the news became public a week later, IPAM wasn’t on the list.\n\n(Read the article for other specific examples of cuts … AI … water and oil.)\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: ‘The Power of Science to Solve Problems Is Almost Limitless’\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/opinion/jay-bhattacharya-nih.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(A sane washing of the NIH director’s comments)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ed Department Hasn’t Even Begun to Fight (opinion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/09/22/ed-department-hasnt-even-begun-fight-opinion\n\nDespite high-profile federal actions against universities like Columbia University; the University of California, Los Angeles; and others over the past few months, many higher ed watchers, including me, have been waiting for the other shoe to drop. While civil rights investigations, demands for massive settlements, cuts to grant funding and threats to institutional accreditation have led to real-world consequences, no institution has lost access to federal student loans.\n\n\nBut—as Friday’s announcement that Harvard University had been placed on heightened cash monitoring status shows—that could change quickly. And regulatory actions by the previous administration increase the likelihood of the Trump administration’s success if they choose to flex the powers provided to them.\n\n\nBiden’s regulatory changes were significant. For example, the regulations expanded the department’s interpretation of standards around an institution’s administrative capability to participate in the federal student loan program. If not satisfied to the department’s liking, these regulations grant the agency the power to kick colleges out of the loan program or make continued participation financially impossible.\n\n\nThe department also has the power to conduct an invasive review of an institution’s administrative capability if it determines that the college was subject to a “significant negative action” by another federal or state agency. Notably, the Biden administration did not provide a meaningful definition of what constitutes a “significant negative action.” Arguably, even the pulling of a single federal grant, for any reason, would satisfy this provision.\n\n\nAnd this is just the beginning. Other changes to institutional financial standards create more ways for McMahon to turn the screws. This includes a minimum requirement of a 10 percent letter of credit—that is, a demand that colleges convince a private lender to back 10 percent of the total amount of federal student aid funds received by the institution each year—if the department merely suspects certain violations. Additional violations compound the required amounts, and there is no cap on what the agency can demand.\n\n\nWhile some colleges may be able to weather this fiscal hit, the vast majority would not. As a result, the Education Department can effectively destroy a college by making it impossible to find enough backup funding to survive.\n\n\nWhy did the Biden administration create such a powerful set of tools? Their target was for-profit colleges, and they hardly expected that their regulatory overreach would land in the hands of a second Trump administration that would come out swinging against traditional public and private institutions.\n\n\nSo, what can colleges do about this?\n\n\nFor investigations based upon past events, institutions should prepare protocols for responding to government inquiries and strengthen their records-retention processes and procurement procedures.\n\n\nTo insulate a college from future actions, reviewing internal compliance standards and procedures in light of these new regulations, as well as updating staff training, can help avoid some painful headaches.\n\n\nOver the past decade, the department has successfully closed colleges down based upon far weaker versions of the current regulations. Today, colleges that get crosswise with the Trump administration should prepare for an assault on their student loan eligibility, because it may be coming.\n\n\nED Wants Grants to Advance “Patriotic Education”\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/09/19/ed-wants-grants-advance-patriotic-education\n\nLast week, Education Secretary Linda McMahon outlined a new plan for how her department would promote “patriotic education” by adding it to the list of priorities that can drive decisions for discretionary grants, including those that support programs at colleges and universities.\n\n\n“It is imperative to promote an education system that teaches future generations honestly about America’s Founding principles, political institutions, and rich history,” McMahon said in a statement about the new proposal. “To truly understand American values, the tireless work it has taken to live up to them, and this country’s exceptional place in world history is the best way to inspire an informed patriotism and love of country.”\n\n\nMcMahon’s other priorities for grant funding include evidence-based literacy, expanding education choice, returning education to the states and advancing AI in education.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Other Office for Civil Rights\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/2025/09/24/hhs-civil-rights-arm-joins-trumps-higher-ed-crackdown\n\nIn June, in an escalation of the Trump administration’s pressure on Harvard University to bow to its demands, a federal Office for Civil Rights announced that the institution was violating federal law.\n\n\nThe office released a nearly 60-page report accusing Harvard of “deliberate indifference” to ongoing discrimination against Jewish and Israeli students, which is illegal under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. “OCR’s findings document that a hostile environment existed, and continues to exist, at Harvard,” the office said in an accompanying news release.\n\n\nBut this wasn’t the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights. It was an office of the same name within the Health and Human Services Department that’s been playing a more public role as part of Trump’s crackdown on higher ed. Officials who served in previous administrations said agencies used to generally defer to the Education Department when it came to civil rights issues in higher ed. But since Trump retook office, colleges and universities are facing increased pressure from probes by HHS and other agencies enforcing the new administration’s right-wing interpretation of civil rights.\n\n\nFor universities, Trump’s HHS OCR represents a new threat to their funding if they’re accused of promoting diversity, equity and inclusion; fostering antisemitism; or letting transgender women play on women’s sports teams.\n\n\n“As we feared, the Trump administration is abusing civil rights tools to advance a radical and divisive agenda that aggressively hoards access to education, living wage jobs, and so much more,” the NAACP Legal Defense Fund said in a statement. “Unfortunately, HHS and many other federal agencies are being used as one of the vehicles to carry out that agenda.”\n\n\n“There are 13 federal agencies with external civil rights enforcement, of which HHS is one, and it’s relatively large.” [former director of the Education Department’s OCR ] … “The administration has used every agency in a contemporaneous, simultaneous assault on universities,” … “It’s unnecessary to do what the administration is doing now, unless one is operating like a mob boss,”\n\n(After listing several examples the article ends with)\n\nLhamon, the former Education Department OCR head, said what the administration has called civil rights investigations into Harvard, Columbia and other universities aren’t really investigations. She noted the administration has used a “mob theory” by going ahead and pulling HHS and other funding from multiple institutions before the investigations are over.\n\n\nInstead, she said, this is “an assault on universities, which is a very different thing from ensuring compliance with the civil rights laws as Congress has enacted them.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Did College Board End Best Admissions Product? (opinion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/09/22/why-did-college-board-end-best-admissions-product-opinion\n\nEarlier this month, College Board announced its decision to kill Landscape, a race-neutral tool that allowed admissions readers to better understand a student’s context for opportunity. After an awkward 2019 rollout as the “Adversity Score,” Landscape gradually gained traction in many selective admissions offices. Among other items, the dashboard provided information on the applicant’s high school, including the economic makeup of their high school class, participation trends for Advanced Placement courses and the school’s percentile SAT scores, as well as information about the local community.\n\n\nIf College Board was worried that somehow people were using the tool as a proxy for race (and they weren’t), well, it wasn’t a very good one. In the most comprehensive study of Landscape being used on the ground, researchers found that it didn’t do anything to increase racial/ethnic diversity in admissions. Things are different when it comes to economic diversity. Use of Landscape is linked with a boost in the likelihood of admission for low-income students. As such, it was a helpful tool given the continued underrepresentation of low-income students at selective institutions.\n\n\nWhile race and class are correlated, they certainly aren’t interchangeable. Admissions officers weren’t using Landscape as a proxy for race; they were using it to compare a student’s SAT score or AP course load to those of their high school classmates. Ivy League institutions that have gone back to requiring SAT/ACT scores have stressed the importance of evaluating test scores in the student’s high school context. Eliminating Landscape makes it harder to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard’s Former President Criticizes Its Approach to Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/harvard-claudine-gay-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nHarvard’s former president, Claudine Gay, offered a blunt assessment of the university’s current administration this month, criticizing it for complying with demands from the Trump White House.\n\n\n“The posture of the institution seems to be one of compliance,” Dr. Gay said in an address on Sept. 3, first reported in The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, on Friday. “This is distressing, not only for those of us who are on campus and facing the consequences directly, but also for all of those in higher ed who look to Harvard for leadership and guidance.”\n\n\n“The number of $500 million is arbitrary, and it will solve nothing,” Dr. Gay said. “There is no justification.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Officials Question Harvard’s Stability, Saying Federal Inquiries Raise Financial Risk\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/trump-harvard-financial-risk.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(This can’t be a serious request, almost any single building alone is worth more than the 36M reported.)\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday opened a new front in its pressure campaign on Harvard University, demanding proof of the financial stability of the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college as well as a guarantee that federal debts will be paid if the school “closes or terminates classes.”\n\n\nStill, the administration is insisting on a guarantee of more than $36 million, representing about 30 percent of the federal financial aid that has flowed to the university during the past year, because of financial risks posed by more than a dozen government investigations targeting the university.\n\n\nThe aggressive actions from the Trump admini stration come as negotiations between Harvard and the White House have stalled over a landmark settlement that would restore the university’s research funding and resolve the multitude of federal investigations aimed at addressing a perceived liberal bias on campus.\n\n\nThe letter from the student aid office also said Harvard’s sale of $750 million in bonds in April, layoffs of staff over the summer and a salary freeze initiated this year “call into question the ability of Harvard to meet its financial responsibility obligations.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/09/19/education-dept-subjects-harvard-more-financial\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/blogs/the-trump-agenda/trump-administration-turns-up-heat-on-harvard-with-financial-lever\n\nED Gives Harvard 20 Days to Provide Admissions Info\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/23/ed-gives-harvard-20-days-provide-admissions-info\n\nThe Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights said Friday that it issued a letter giving Harvard University 20 days to submit documents related to admissions that it says the university has been refusing to provide.\n\n\n“Despite OCR’s repeated requests for data, Harvard has refused to provide the requested information necessary for OCR to make a compliance determination,” the office continued, adding that the university will “face further enforcement action” if the information is not provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Heartbreaking’ and ‘Cruel’: A Texas State Professor on His Firing and Why He’s Suing\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/heartbreaking-and-cruel-a-texas-state-professor-on-his-firing-and-why-hes-suing\n\nAlter, an associate professor of history at Texas State University, was perplexed. He knew remarks he had made at a conference three days earlier about a hypothetical “overthrow” of the U.S. government, documented on the internet, had provoked an online campaign against him, but the last time he checked, the posts had received very little attention.\n\n\nThis stunning turnaround time is at the core of Alter’s lawsuit against the university, which he filed Tuesday and shared with The Chronicle. In Alter’s telling, he was fired “without an ounce of due process,” a loaded term in the American judicial system but one that carries an added weight for someone of Alter’s status: He was tenured — as of 10 days before his firing.\n\n\nWhen he began his remarks on that Sunday, Alter introduced himself by name and by his membership with Socialist Horizon, one of the groups organizing the conference, and his union, the Texas State Employees Union. Alter told The Chronicle said he was “very conscious” not to identify himself as a Texas State professor, and while a participant identified Alter’s employment as part of an “innocuous conversation” about how many teachers Texas State educates, Alter would probably have been just another participant had it not been for Borysenko.\n\n\nAn online influencer who calls herself an “anti-communist fascist leading the revolution against the revolution,” Borysenko recorded Alter’s remarks in full. The next day, September 8, she uploaded several videos across social media, including YouTube and X, with pointed captions identifying Alter and her interpretation of his remarks.\n\n\nPartisan Fury Got Him a Presidency. And Then It Took Him Down.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/partisan-fury-got-him-a-presidency-and-then-it-took-him-down\n\nWelsh was hastily named A&M’s interim president in 2023 after the proposed hiring of a new journalism director, Kathleen O. McElroy, infuriated conservatives who saw her as a champion of the kinds of diversity programs that, in Texas, were already on the outs. Replacing M. Katherine Banks, who had resigned the A&M presidency over the McElroy ordeal, Welsh faced a politically tricky task: making himself both palatable to conservatives, who were skeptical of creeping liberalism at A&M, and acceptable to beleaguered university faculty, who felt academic freedom was under threat. For a while, at least, Welsh seemed to pull it off.\n\n\nIn recent days, however, Welsh’s juggling act fell apart. In trying to appease both conservatives and faculty, he managed to satisfy neither. The politics that engulfed Welsh are indicative of a larger national trend, in which college leaders are struggling — to varying degrees — to uphold fundamental values of institutional autonomy and academic freedom in the face of a broad conservative effort to reshape higher education. Very few, it seems, are striking a balance that pleases either side.\n\n\nThis [several dismissals] still was not enough. Harrison continued to make media appearances and post about the events, often tagging the Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, and the Texas A&M University System chancellor, Glenn Hegar. Abbott-appointed regents, Harrison wrote, were “pushing transgender indoctrination on students.” The state’s lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, said last week that Welsh “did not handle the recent situation … as he should have,” but said his fate should be left up to the regents.\n\n\nIt was the regents, along with Hegar, who announced Thursday that Welsh would resign. But it was Harrison [Republican state elected] who took the credit, telling The Texas Tribune that his social-media posts hastened Welsh’s resignation. Swift action like this, Harrison told the outlet, is what “I firmly believe Texans want.”\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor sues West Point, says the academy is restricting free speech | AP News\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/west-point-lawsuit-first-amendment-professor-a4db138011c6fb9c8b445ce5a106aac2\n\nThe U.S. Military Academy at West Point is banning opinions by professors in the classroom and some books and courses in a crackdown that violates the First Amendment, a law professor at the military school said in a lawsuit Monday seeking class action status.\n\n\nBakken also noted in the lawsuit that he has a contract with a publisher for a book that is critical of some aspects of West Point and doesn’t want to seek approval from the school’s leadership prior to its publication because “it is very likely such approval will be withheld.”\n\n\nBakken’s lawsuit said the school began to scrutinize faculty speech after a January executive order from President Donald Trump to “carefully review the leadership, curriculum and instructors of the United States Service Academies and other defense academic institutions.”\n\n\nThe lawsuit said the academy in the spring withdrew books from its library, removed words and phrases from faculty members’ syllabi, eliminated courses and majors and threatened or punished faculty members for teaching, speaking and writing without prior approval from the school.\n\n\nDuring the summer, the academy removed information about faculty members’ published books, articles, essays and scholarship entries from all faculty members’ webpages on the school’s website, the lawsuit said. It also directed instructors not to express opinions in the classroom, it said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal judge orders Trump to restore $500 million in frozen UCLA medical research grants - Los Angeles Times\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-22/rita-lin-federal-judge-restores-ucla-nih-grants\n\nA federal judge Monday ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in UCLA medical research grants, halting for now a nearly two-month funding crisis that UC leaders said threatened the future of the nation’s premier public university system.\n\n\nLin’s order provides the biggest relief to UCLA but affects federal funding awarded to all 10 UC campuses. Lin ruled that the NIH grants were suspended by form letters that were unspecific to the research, a likely violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, which regulates executive branch rulemaking.\n\n\nIn addition to the medical grant freezes — which had prompted talks of possible UCLA layoffs or closures of labs conducting cancer and stroke research, among other studies — Lin said the government would have to restore millions of dollars in Department of Defense and Department of Transportation grants to UC schools.\n\n\nLin explained her thinking during a hearing last week. She said the Trump administration committed a “fundamental sin” in its “un-reasoned mass terminations” of grants using “letters that don’t go through the required factors that the agency is supposed to consider.”\n\n\nErwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley law school, worked with Polsky and argued the case in front of Lin.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/blogs/the-trump-agenda/500-million-in-grant-funding-should-be-restored-to-uc-system-judge-rules\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/24/judge-restores-another-batch-frozen-grants-ucla\n\n\n\n\nThe Campus With a Front-Row Seat to Trump’s Attack on Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-campus-with-a-front-row-seat-to-trumps-attack-on-higher-ed\n\nThe influx of officers and troops can leave the impression of a campus under siege, an impression also reinforced by less visible interactions. The day after President Trump announced the deployment of the National Guard in Washington, GW received a letter from the Justice Department announcing it had found the campus administration responsible for “deliberate indifference” to the “hostile environment” for Jewish, American-Israeli, and Israeli students and faculty.\n\n\nA week after the DOJ letter [Department of Justice’s “deliberate indifference” letter in August] was published, the GW student socialist organization released its own demands, co-signed by 45 student organizations, and posted an open letter about them. The six demands include banning all external law enforcement from campus, refusing compliance and capitulation with the Trump administration, and calling for the university to publicly declare its support for free speech. The demands also call for more communication and guidelines from the university regarding interacting with ICE and immigration authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.K. Weighs Streamlining Visa Process for Researchers\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/2025/09/26/uk-weighs-streamlining-visa-process-researchers\n\nThe U.K. is reportedly considering removing fees for its global talent visa in response.

Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a former top aide whom Mr. Adams describes as his “sister,” was indicted on money laundering and bribery charges for allegedly calling in favors in exchange for a bit part in an MGM+ streaming show and cash that her son used to buy a new Porsche.\n\n\nAnd it swept up almost every department in Mr. Adams’s administration — especially, and most importantly, the New York Police Department. The culture of impunity described in dozens of lawsuits, indictments and whistle-blower complaints was so widespread that one of the mayor’s own former police commissioners sued him for enforcing what the commissioner characterized as a culture of “lawlessness.”\n\n\nMr. Adams, a former police captain, has called himself the department’s “overbearing dad.” He installed his former cop friends at the top levels of the department and of his administration generally. Many of them padded out their entourages and gave their buddies cushy assignments and huge overtime payouts.\n\n\nShe responded with a shocking accusation in a complaint to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission: Her boss, the chief of department, Jeff Maddrey, had pressured her into serving that overtime with him at 1 Police Plaza, where he repeatedly sexually abused her. “I keep saying, ‘stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.’ And he just kept on,” the lieutenant, a 19-year veteran of the force and a mother of three, recalled, heaving with tears, in a televised interview last March. “This guy is a monster.” She said Chief Maddrey, a friend and an ally of Mr. Adams’s for more than 20 years, demanded a kickback from the overtime pay and even told her to pay for a vacation for him and his wife.\n\n\nAfter the lieutenant came forward with her accusations, nude videos of her circulated on police group chats. Then the Police Department tried to claw back the overtime money that her predator boss allegedly coerced her into taking.\n\n\n“I’m a former creationist. Here’s why ‘follow the science’ failed. The moment I finally admitted that Darwin was right didn’t feel liberating. It felt like grief.”\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/09/22/muslim-missionary-evolutionary-biologist-human/\n(Thanks BE!)\n\nAs an 18-year-old Muslim missionary, I enrolled at University College London intent on destroying the theory of evolution. I arrived on a mission: I wanted to prove that Charles Darwin was wrong. Like so many other creationists, I believed scientists were either lying to us or they were so biased that they were unknowingly misreading the data. The only way to dismantle their theory was to inspect the data for myself and prove it wrong.\n\n\nTwo decades later, I am an evolutionary biologist. Working on a documentary about our species’ 300,000-year-old story made me reflect on my own evolution — and how, when you ask people to do something simple such as “believe the science,” you might actually be asking them to pay an almost unimaginable price.\n\n\nBy and large, we share the opinions of our tribe. So when we ask people to believe in climate modeling or vaccine science, what we are really asking people to do is choose between their community’s beliefs and an abstract dataset. It’s a direct referendum on the people they know and love. Most people will not betray their tribe for a stranger in a lab coat.\n\n\nIn biological terms, this is an extremely rational predisposition — or, put another way, it’s human nature. And it’s the main reason simply shouting “trust the science” will never truly change people’s minds.\n\n\nIn many ways, I traded a warm religious community for a cold and often selfish secular world.\n\n\nUnderstanding these dynamics can illuminate the current quagmire of science and politics. When people of faith and political conservatives see their views mocked, dismissed or ostracized, they begin to see science not as a method but as a tribe they’re not a part of. And once science becomes just another tribe, its authority collapses.\n\n\nIn the 13 years since I left my missionary world, many Muslims have embraced evolution. That progress didn’t come from outsiders or even nonpracticing Muslims like me; it came from scholars, thinkers and activists who argued for the compatibility of Islam and evolution. It is why we must tolerate religious and, for that matter, right-wing viewpoints more. Not only is more robust science achieved when all biases are represented, but the perception of left-wing atheists having a monopoly on science is a disaster. The best ambassadors to skeptical communities are people from within those communities.\n\n\nEvolution is the underlying assumption of biology; nothing in the field makes sense without it. It should trouble us that so many people still reject it. Paradigm shifts are possible, although parting with the beliefs of one’s tribe is an enormous decision. Empathy for that hesitation, not scorn for it, is the way forward.\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

He is even going after the same philanthropy — the Open Society Foundations — that Orban went after.”\n\n\nTrump’s favorability ratings have fallen from 50.5 percent during his first week in office this year to 46.1 percent on Sept. 22, but that has not deterred him. Just the opposite: Trump, his vice president, his aides and his cabinet members initiate daily attacks on the left, some illegal, some unfounded, but all damaging and costly.\n\n\nTrump’s actions, Westwood [a political scientist at Dartmouth] wrote, “are now escalating into a direct assault on the institutional infrastructure of the left.” However, Westwood continued. “this is more than a rhetorical move; threatening the 501(c)(3) status of these foundations aims to choke off the financial lifeblood of a vast network of opposition groups, effectively criminalizing dissent.”\n\n\nGoldstone [professor of public policy at George Mason]: We are now a country in which people can lose their jobs for making the wrong joke; where universities, media, and law firms have to defend themselves against lawsuits and investigations that threaten to bankrupt them; where people in America (even American citizens) can be rounded up, arrested, and put in detention if they have the wrong accent or work at the wrong kind of job, and where masked ICE agents and uniformed national military patrol the streets of our major cities.",

This is a long, worthwhile read that I hope to summarize in blog format. For now, here are a few of the recommendations.)\n\n\nFaculties, administrations, and governing boards must refuse to comply with unlawful federal government demands based on Title VI investigations that impinge on institutional autonomy, faculty academic freedom (including the faculty’s role in governance), student academic freedom, and freedom of expression of faculty members, students, and staff.\n\n\n\n\nAdministrations and governing boards must publicly affirm their commitment to defending academic freedom—defined as the protection of teaching, research, and intramural and extramural speech—and support faculty members under attack.\n\n\n\n\nAdministrations and governing boards must respect the importance of faculty involvement in shared governance processes when creating or changing institutional policies and in determining responses to governmental demands for information or institutional actions. They must entertain faculty resolutions that protect unpopular teaching and research as well as controversial speech and forms of expressive activity.\n\n\n\n\nFaculties, administrations, and governing boards must not engage in anticipatory obedience, including by eliminating programs; scrubbing websites; removing particular words or phrases from syllabi, course materials, and course titles and descriptions; or reporting on community members—faculty members, staff, or students— whose political speech or intellectual work may make them targets for governmental discipline or deportation. Pressure from politicians, donors, and trustees must be resisted because it creates a slippery slope for other forms of censorship and control.\n\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/23/aaup-accuses-trump-weaponizing-civil-rights-law\n\nIs the AAUP Too Partisan? Its President Doesn’t Think So.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/is-the-aaup-too-partisan-its-president-doesnt-think-so\n\n“We’re taking it to the courts and the streets — and we need you.” So reads the subject line of an April email from the American Association of University Professors, authored by its president, Todd Wolfson.\n\n\nThe sentence encapsulates the 110-year-old membership organization’s approach to the second Trump presidency. It has filed lawsuits challenging the administration’s aggressive higher-ed agenda — most recently to contest what it called the “attempt to unlawfully stifle free speech” within the University of California system. Wolfson has advocated for a vigorous defense of the sector, saying in a recent interview that (nonviolent) “militant job actions” may be necessary.\n\n\nBefore the presidential election, Wolfson, who is on leave from his job as an associate professor of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University’s New Brunswick campus, called then-vice presidential candidate JD Vance a “fascist” — a judgment he’s not backed away from since.\n\n\nThe courts are an important place to try to stop the Trump administration’s attempt to illegally refashion higher education to mirror, or at least lean towards, the ideological leanings of the Trump administration, which I would say are radically right-wing leanings. We do not think that lawsuits are enough, but they’re one critical tool.\n\n\nThe next ruling we expect is the AAUP v. [Secretary of State Marco] Rubio ruling. Our hope is that it will be really clear that people like President Trump or Secretary of State Rubio will not be allowed to threaten deportation because of the political speech of students or faculty or staff. That lawsuit is meant to protect the freedom of speech of people in our sector.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, they [general decline in public trust] exist because people like Ron DeSantis [Florida’s Republican governor] and Chris Rufo, [a right-wing anti-DEI activist], have been speaking very loudly, unfairly disparaging higher education for a very long time, without the appropriate response from higher-education workers, higher-education institutions. We’ve heard a message from a radical right-wing regime that is attempting to smear higher education, and doing a good job of it. So of course if they are over and over putting out a negative message about higher ed, then people are going to consume that message, and there hasn’t been a response to that message that’s been effective.\n\n\nWe’re an economic engine. We’re a health-care engine. We’re a technological-innovation engine. And there’s one more thing that I really think is important to remind ourselves of: Kids go to college so that they can get a job and imagine that they’re going to do a little bit better than their parents. Skyrocketing tuition and skyrocketing student debt have made it so that higher education is a difficult choice for students. AAUP believes that public higher education should be free, and so we want to fight for that. We have plenty of money to do that. We have plenty of billionaires who now are becoming trillionaires that can help us pay for this, if the most wealthy are taxed a bit more.\n\n\nNo, I don’t think ‘progressive.’ What AAUP defines itself as is an organization that believes that higher education should be a common public good for everyone. We align ourselves with the vast majority of Americans of any political stripe who need education for their kids, their families, in order to move forward in this country.\n\n\nFirst and foremost, the Trump administration isn’t your garden-variety conservative. The attacks they have unleashed on higher education are of historic proportion. What they’re putting on the table resembles an extinction event for the sector. So we have to fight for the survival of higher education.\n\n\nSo you’re saying to me AAUP is partisan, because the Trump administration is slapping higher ed and we’re standing up and fighting back? No. No. We are standing for what we always stood for, which is a powerful higher-education sector that leads to innovation and social mobility and is a bedrock of democracy.\n\n\nIt’s them — the radical right wing — that is politicizing higher ed. We will not shrink from that. If people have a problem with that, then they can get in line with Trump and Chris Rufo, and that’s fine. But we are gonna stand up for our institutions, and we are gonna be proud and loud about it.\n\n\nThe AAUP has a very clear agenda. We are going to fight over the budget right now and try to get fully funded NIH [National Institutes of Health], NSF [National Science Foundation], NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]. We are going to fight to make sure that the TRIO program, which supports first-generation college kids, is fully enshrined in this budget. … Then we are going to pivot from there and put out a proactive vision for the future of higher education.",

    "text": "Conservative are targeting speech. More teachers may lose their jobs. - The Washington Post\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/09/20/conservatives-target-teachers-free-speech/\n\nA day after a video of the exchange began circulating [Texas A&M Children’s Literature class], the instructor was fired, the department head and dean were removed from their posts, and the Justice Department said it would look into the matter. Ten days later, as cries from the right continued to echo across the internet, the university president said he was resigning, bringing the tenure of a retired four-star general to an unexpected and abrupt halt.\n\n\nNow the state lawmaker who led the campaign against them says he’s being inundated with tips about what he characterized as offensive efforts to indoctrinate students. “This is just the start,” Texas state Rep. Brian Harrison, a conservative firebrand, told The Washington Post. “I hope this puts the fear of God into every university president and chancellor in Texas.”\n\n\nOver the past several years, conservatives have focused on reshaping teachings of race, gender identity and sexual orientation, leading to a spate of state laws regulating what educators can say and to the firing of a number of teachers. That campaign mushroomed this month as conservatives pushed to oust people they say have gone too far in criticizing Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist who was fatally shot at Utah Valley University last week.\n\n\nSo far, the Texas Education Agency has received 281 complaints about teacher comments in the wake of Kirk’s killing, with staff still reviewing them, spokeswoman Jake Kobersky said Friday. He said the agency had not yet punished any of these teachers, though some districts have acted and the state might step in as well.\n\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said she sees no end in sight to the scrutiny of teachers’ speech. Kirk’s killing was horrible, she said, but does not justify going after teachers who have a diversity of opinions.\n\n\nNYTimes: The Firing of Educators Over Kirk Comments Follows a Familiar Playbook\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/us/firing-educators-kirk-free-speech.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(With background on Brooklyn College’s non-reappointment of four adjunct faculty members for “conduct”)\n\nThe American Association of University Professors, an organization founded to defend academic freedom, said it was aware of retaliation against about 60 professors and teachers in connection with critical comments they made about Mr. Kirk or people mourning him.\n\n\nFaculty First Responders, an organization that works with the association to advise educators who are the victim of doxxing and harassment campaigns, has reached out to 35 academic workers in the past week, most of them professors, whose comments about Mr. Kirk have been spread in right-wing media, according to Heather Steffen, the group’s director.\n\n\nThe Texas Education Agency has said it is investigating hundreds of employees at elementary or secondary schools for similar reasons.\n\n\nIf they choose to mount a legal fight, fired employees of public institutions, which are bound by the First Amendment, probably have better chances of prevailing in court than those fired from private institutions.\n\n\nProponents of academic freedom see the current crackdown on professors as an assault on freedom of expression that echoes dark periods in American history. At Brooklyn College, where four adjunct professors were dismissed this year for their pro-Palestinian activism, a faculty union called the movement to curb educators’ speech the “New McCarthyism.”\n\n\nOne of the four, Corinna Mullin, who was an adjunct professor of political science, said that recent developments show that academic freedom is not a universal right but a conditional privilege.\n\n\n“And it seems that it’s granted or withdrawn based on the context of our speech — those who echo power are shielded,” said Dr. Mullin, who was arrested during a police raid on a Gaza Solidarity encampment at City College in 2024. Trespassing charges against her were later dropped.\n\n\nShe said she believed that activists on the right will continue to expand their attacks to take in “all speech on the left associated with social justice, racial justice, all these uncomfortable truths that challenge power in this country.”\n\n\nIn several instances, Mr. Kirk has used the First Amendment to sue universities that tried to block his organization’s campus presence.\n\n\nBut critics have argued that Mr. Kirk’s promotion of free speech was riddled with hypocrisy. Matthew Boedy, a professor at the University of North Georgia who has written a book that focuses heavily on Mr. Kirk, “The Seven Mountains Mandate,” called Mr. Kirk’s stance “an empty support of free speech.”\n\n\nProfessor in court fight over Charlie Kirk post is temporarily reinstated\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/09/25/charlie-kirk-shooting-professor-south-dakota/\n\nA federal court on Wednesday temporarily reinstated a University of South Dakota professor [a tenured art professor that described Kirk on facebook as a “hate spreading Nazi.” ]who was put on administrative leave after making negative comments on social media about Charlie Kirk on the same day that the conservative activist was shot.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/26/court-order-reinstates-sd-prof-fired-kirk-comments\n\n\n\nNYTimes Gift Article: The Grand Strategy Behind Trump’s Crackdown on Academia\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/opinion/trump-academia-victim-may-mailman.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ok8.sM5c.tGhv1r82oHx-&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(hard-to-get-through interview with Mary Mailman the right hand person behind Stephen Miller’s attempted assault on higher education, though the interviewer, Ross Douhat, doesn’t bother to bring that up…)\n\nDouthat: What is wrong with the American university? Mailman: I don’t think it’s every university, but I would say the biggest one that comes for me is a culture of victimhood — a glorification of victimhood — that is ultimately bad for Western civilization and bad for the country.\n\n\nMailman: It’s not necessarily that they are victims but that they should be victims. That it’s good to be a victim. That in admissions, what is it better to be? It’s better to be in a minority class, whether that’s a sexual minority class, whether that’s a racial minority class. There’s something better to being underrepresented, to being somehow downtrodden, that should be treated as preferential or better.\n\n\nbut the whole idea of treating people differently based on whether they are oppressed or oppressors, and if it’s seen as Meghan Markle — why does she want to appear like a victim?\n\n\nMailman: Yeah, there is an executive order that discusses universities. Specifically, Title VI says that for any federally funded educational institution, they can’t discriminate on the basis of race or national origin. This has been used both on the antisemitism front, which is national origin and race, and then also on what people broadly describe as the D.E.I. front. And so if you’re going to be federally funded, then we’re going to make sure that you don’t discriminate on the basis of race.\n\n\nDouthat: Pause there for a moment. First of all, how did you pick which schools you sent letters to?\n\n\nMailman: So I think we primarily relied on the Department of Education to pick what they either knew, based on complaints that have been received, and you had House investigations. A lot of this information was public, here and there. It was in government databases. Some of them are just very out loud, like the U.C. system. So I think there was some flag waving by certain universities.\n\n\nDouthat: I mean, also, the federal government doesn’t actually have the power to shut down Harvard University.\n\n\nMailman: No, but in theory —\n\n\nDouthat: But you can defund Harvard.\n\n\nMailman: Right. And what’s Harvard’s special thing? It is that it’s, in theory, a leader, and the question is: A leader in what direction?\n\n\nMailman: Right, and that’s always an option. If anybody thinks that any of this is too burdensome, especially very well-funded universities, then just do none of it. Just be Hillsdale. And it’s funny, because for research — I mean, people don’t really understand the massive amount of money that goes to research. It’s billions and billions. Harvard right now has something like $7 billion of promised grants. These are huge, huge numbers. But if all of the research was good, something that was going to cure cancer, then a donor would love to fund that. I mean, to be the person that cured cancer?\n\n\nThe problem is not whether the government should or shouldn’t be funding cancer research — it absolutely should — but the unwieldiness of it has led to basically an unchecked situation. I think it is actually proper to have a right sizing, where universities are relying on the federal government to a certain extent, where these are things that are maybe not close to a breakthrough and that there is an opportunity for the private sector to spend money in ways that are beneficial to society.\n\n\nMailman: Wealthy people funding universities, funding science, funding our future is something that has history in this country.\n\n\nSo I think there’s a recognition. It’s all — of course, there’s no recognition of fault. These are settlements. But by paying some of this back, I think there is, somewhat for the public, a sense of acknowledgment of wrongdoing. Not a legal sense but sort of a moral sense\n\n(Really, not sure that is how the payee feels)\n\nNot only that, but to the extent you have universities that are just hotbeds of radicalism, that’s not good for the student. That’s not good for the culture. That’s not good for the campus. That’s bad for the country. So that is all true. And I think the administration believes that intellectual diversity is a key factor to a good university that we would send our kids to.\n\n\nDouthat: I think that’s right, just based on my own experience living in a college town and speaking to people who work in higher education. There is some degree, first, to which the Trump administration is pushing on an open door and also some degree to which leaders of universities are happy to say, “Oh, we didn’t want to do this, but the Trump administration made us do it,” but in fact, it’s something that they themselves want to do.\n\n(I could keep going here, but the whole interview is just too much, though I can’t resist adding this)\n\nMailman: It’s not a full comparison of all universities across the nation. But at the end of the day, Harvard reacted to a letter that asked for a few simple changes with a lawsuit that basically said: Instead of us showing any amount of good faith effort to commit ourselves to the policies that are important to the United States, we’re going to instead say we refuse to even answer you. These are billions of federal dollars, and I think that the funder of that can ask for a basic relationship.",

School officials cite the Trump administration’s summer pause on visa appointments followed by increased scrutiny of applicants, along with other policies aimed at shrinking the number of international students. Some say shifts in the technology job market are also decreasing demand abroad for certain graduate programs.\n\n\nThe U.S. enrolled a record 1.1 million international students in 2023-24—who contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy through tuition, food and living expenses, according to NAFSA: Association of International Educators.\n\n\n“I feel I’m now in the middle of nowhere,” said Elham Shamiri, an Iranian citizen who has been trying to obtain a visa to start a Ph.D. program in chemistry at the University of Vermont. She and hundreds of other Iranians have been asking politicians to carve out an exception for students with admissions offers. “We have nothing to do with politics,” Shamiri said, and shouldn’t be conflated with terrorism. “We are just students truly committed to research.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/09/23/international-enrollment-down-small-regional\n\n\n\nUnder Trump, NSF faces worst crisis in its 75-year history | Science | AAAS\n\nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/under-trump-nsf-faces-worst-crisis-its-75-year-history\n\nThe White House has ordered the $9 billion agency to abandon long-running programs, terminate more than 2000 grants, and reverse decisions on what to fund next based on the administration’s political agenda, which excludes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts and climate change research. NSF is also making radical changes in its daily operations, including sharply reducing its reliance on top academic scientists on loan from their institutions and realigning the agency’s entire grantmaking apparatus to conform to Trump’s priorities (see sidebar, below).\n\n\nMany science policy experts say those changes move NSF away from its founding principles, laid out in a 1945 report to then-President Harry Truman, to maintain U.S. leadership in science by funding the best ideas across all fields and training the next generation of researchers. That compares with the more targeted missions of most government agencies, such as advancing energy, health, or space exploration. But both of NSF’s goals, as put forward by Vannevar Bush in his seminal report that led to NSF’s creation in 1950, have lost support under Trump.\n\n\n“This administration doesn’t buy the idea that the government’s investment in basic research buys us anything useful,” one former senior NSF official says. “And if they don’t agree with Bush’s assumption, then why bother to even have an NSF?”\n\n\nKeivan Stassun, who was named to NSB in January 2023, sees DOGE operating as the ultimate decision-maker at NSF, in tandem with the White House Office of Management and Budget. And OMB, he says, has discarded NSF’s well-regarded system of choosing the most worthy proposals. “If OMB is using anything like NSF’s merit review criteria,” says Stassun, an astrophysicist at Vanderbilt University, “that has not been communicated and is certainly not apparent to me.”\n\n\nFor more than 4 decades, NSF has supported a network of institutes that bring together top mathematicians and rising stars for in-person workshops to explore a range of hot topics and spark new areas of research. “The math institutes are the crown jewels of our portfolio,” says mathematician Juan Meza, former director of NSF’s math division, which spends roughly 15% of its annual budget on the network. “They support the entire mathematical community.”\n\n\nThe Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) has been part of that network since 2000 and is known for bridging the gap between academia and industry by working on problems that appeal to both theoretical and applied mathematicians. … On 27 July, NSF issued an embargoed press release announcing it would fund seven institutes in the network, including IPAM, which would get another $17 million over the next 5 years. But when the news became public a week later, IPAM wasn’t on the list.\n\n(Read the article for other specific examples of cuts … AI … water and oil.)\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: ‘The Power of Science to Solve Problems Is Almost Limitless’\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/opinion/jay-bhattacharya-nih.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(A sane washing of the NIH director’s comments)",

    "text": "The Ed Department Hasn’t Even Begun to Fight (opinion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/09/22/ed-department-hasnt-even-begun-fight-opinion\n\nDespite high-profile federal actions against universities like Columbia University; the University of California, Los Angeles; and others over the past few months, many higher ed watchers, including me, have been waiting for the other shoe to drop. While civil rights investigations, demands for massive settlements, cuts to grant funding and threats to institutional accreditation have led to real-world consequences, no institution has lost access to federal student loans.\n\n\nBut—as Friday’s announcement that Harvard University had been placed on heightened cash monitoring status shows—that could change quickly. And regulatory actions by the previous administration increase the likelihood of the Trump administration’s success if they choose to flex the powers provided to them.\n\n\nBiden’s regulatory changes were significant. For example, the regulations expanded the department’s interpretation of standards around an institution’s administrative capability to participate in the federal student loan program. If not satisfied to the department’s liking, these regulations grant the agency the power to kick colleges out of the loan program or make continued participation financially impossible.\n\n\nThe department also has the power to conduct an invasive review of an institution’s administrative capability if it determines that the college was subject to a “significant negative action” by another federal or state agency. Notably, the Biden administration did not provide a meaningful definition of what constitutes a “significant negative action.” Arguably, even the pulling of a single federal grant, for any reason, would satisfy this provision.\n\n\nAnd this is just the beginning. Other changes to institutional financial standards create more ways for McMahon to turn the screws. This includes a minimum requirement of a 10 percent letter of credit—that is, a demand that colleges convince a private lender to back 10 percent of the total amount of federal student aid funds received by the institution each year—if the department merely suspects certain violations. Additional violations compound the required amounts, and there is no cap on what the agency can demand.\n\n\nWhile some colleges may be able to weather this fiscal hit, the vast majority would not. As a result, the Education Department can effectively destroy a college by making it impossible to find enough backup funding to survive.\n\n\nWhy did the Biden administration create such a powerful set of tools? Their target was for-profit colleges, and they hardly expected that their regulatory overreach would land in the hands of a second Trump administration that would come out swinging against traditional public and private institutions.\n\n\nSo, what can colleges do about this?\n\n\nFor investigations based upon past events, institutions should prepare protocols for responding to government inquiries and strengthen their records-retention processes and procurement procedures.\n\n\nTo insulate a college from future actions, reviewing internal compliance standards and procedures in light of these new regulations, as well as updating staff training, can help avoid some painful headaches.\n\n\nOver the past decade, the department has successfully closed colleges down based upon far weaker versions of the current regulations. Today, colleges that get crosswise with the Trump administration should prepare for an assault on their student loan eligibility, because it may be coming.\n\n\nED Wants Grants to Advance “Patriotic Education”\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/09/19/ed-wants-grants-advance-patriotic-education\n\nLast week, Education Secretary Linda McMahon outlined a new plan for how her department would promote “patriotic education” by adding it to the list of priorities that can drive decisions for discretionary grants, including those that support programs at colleges and universities.\n\n\n“It is imperative to promote an education system that teaches future generations honestly about America’s Founding principles, political institutions, and rich history,” McMahon said in a statement about the new proposal. “To truly understand American values, the tireless work it has taken to live up to them, and this country’s exceptional place in world history is the best way to inspire an informed patriotism and love of country.”\n\n\nMcMahon’s other priorities for grant funding include evidence-based literacy, expanding education choice, returning education to the states and advancing AI in education.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Other Office for Civil Rights\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/2025/09/24/hhs-civil-rights-arm-joins-trumps-higher-ed-crackdown\n\nIn June, in an escalation of the Trump administration’s pressure on Harvard University to bow to its demands, a federal Office for Civil Rights announced that the institution was violating federal law.\n\n\nThe office released a nearly 60-page report accusing Harvard of “deliberate indifference” to ongoing discrimination against Jewish and Israeli students, which is illegal under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. “OCR’s findings document that a hostile environment existed, and continues to exist, at Harvard,” the office said in an accompanying news release.\n\n\nBut this wasn’t the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights. It was an office of the same name within the Health and Human Services Department that’s been playing a more public role as part of Trump’s crackdown on higher ed. Officials who served in previous administrations said agencies used to generally defer to the Education Department when it came to civil rights issues in higher ed. But since Trump retook office, colleges and universities are facing increased pressure from probes by HHS and other agencies enforcing the new administration’s right-wing interpretation of civil rights.\n\n\nFor universities, Trump’s HHS OCR represents a new threat to their funding if they’re accused of promoting diversity, equity and inclusion; fostering antisemitism; or letting transgender women play on women’s sports teams.\n\n\n“As we feared, the Trump administration is abusing civil rights tools to advance a radical and divisive agenda that aggressively hoards access to education, living wage jobs, and so much more,” the NAACP Legal Defense Fund said in a statement. “Unfortunately, HHS and many other federal agencies are being used as one of the vehicles to carry out that agenda.”\n\n\n“There are 13 federal agencies with external civil rights enforcement, of which HHS is one, and it’s relatively large.” [former director of the Education Department’s OCR ] … “The administration has used every agency in a contemporaneous, simultaneous assault on universities,” … “It’s unnecessary to do what the administration is doing now, unless one is operating like a mob boss,”\n\n(After listing several examples the article ends with)\n\nLhamon, the former Education Department OCR head, said what the administration has called civil rights investigations into Harvard, Columbia and other universities aren’t really investigations. She noted the administration has used a “mob theory” by going ahead and pulling HHS and other funding from multiple institutions before the investigations are over.\n\n\nInstead, she said, this is “an assault on universities, which is a very different thing from ensuring compliance with the civil rights laws as Congress has enacted them.”",

    "text": "Why Did College Board End Best Admissions Product? (opinion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/09/22/why-did-college-board-end-best-admissions-product-opinion\n\nEarlier this month, College Board announced its decision to kill Landscape, a race-neutral tool that allowed admissions readers to better understand a student’s context for opportunity. After an awkward 2019 rollout as the “Adversity Score,” Landscape gradually gained traction in many selective admissions offices. Among other items, the dashboard provided information on the applicant’s high school, including the economic makeup of their high school class, participation trends for Advanced Placement courses and the school’s percentile SAT scores, as well as information about the local community.\n\n\nIf College Board was worried that somehow people were using the tool as a proxy for race (and they weren’t), well, it wasn’t a very good one. In the most comprehensive study of Landscape being used on the ground, researchers found that it didn’t do anything to increase racial/ethnic diversity in admissions. Things are different when it comes to economic diversity. Use of Landscape is linked with a boost in the likelihood of admission for low-income students. As such, it was a helpful tool given the continued underrepresentation of low-income students at selective institutions.\n\n\nWhile race and class are correlated, they certainly aren’t interchangeable. Admissions officers weren’t using Landscape as a proxy for race; they were using it to compare a student’s SAT score or AP course load to those of their high school classmates. Ivy League institutions that have gone back to requiring SAT/ACT scores have stressed the importance of evaluating test scores in the student’s high school context. Eliminating Landscape makes it harder to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard’s Former President Criticizes Its Approach to Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/harvard-claudine-gay-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nHarvard’s former president, Claudine Gay, offered a blunt assessment of the university’s current administration this month, criticizing it for complying with demands from the Trump White House.\n\n\n“The posture of the institution seems to be one of compliance,” Dr. Gay said in an address on Sept. 3, first reported in The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, on Friday. “This is distressing, not only for those of us who are on campus and facing the consequences directly, but also for all of those in higher ed who look to Harvard for leadership and guidance.”\n\n\n“The number of $500 million is arbitrary, and it will solve nothing,” Dr. Gay said. “There is no justification.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Officials Question Harvard’s Stability, Saying Federal Inquiries Raise Financial Risk\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/trump-harvard-financial-risk.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(This can’t be a serious request, almost any single building alone is worth more than the 36M reported.)\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday opened a new front in its pressure campaign on Harvard University, demanding proof of the financial stability of the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college as well as a guarantee that federal debts will be paid if the school “closes or terminates classes.”\n\n\nStill, the administration is insisting on a guarantee of more than $36 million, representing about 30 percent of the federal financial aid that has flowed to the university during the past year, because of financial risks posed by more than a dozen government investigations targeting the university.\n\n\nThe aggressive actions from the Trump admini stration come as negotiations between Harvard and the White House have stalled over a landmark settlement that would restore the university’s research funding and resolve the multitude of federal investigations aimed at addressing a perceived liberal bias on campus.\n\n\nThe letter from the student aid office also said Harvard’s sale of $750 million in bonds in April, layoffs of staff over the summer and a salary freeze initiated this year “call into question the ability of Harvard to meet its financial responsibility obligations.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/09/19/education-dept-subjects-harvard-more-financial\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/blogs/the-trump-agenda/trump-administration-turns-up-heat-on-harvard-with-financial-lever\n\nED Gives Harvard 20 Days to Provide Admissions Info\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/23/ed-gives-harvard-20-days-provide-admissions-info\n\nThe Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights said Friday that it issued a letter giving Harvard University 20 days to submit documents related to admissions that it says the university has been refusing to provide.\n\n\n“Despite OCR’s repeated requests for data, Harvard has refused to provide the requested information necessary for OCR to make a compliance determination,” the office continued, adding that the university will “face further enforcement action” if the information is not provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Heartbreaking’ and ‘Cruel’: A Texas State Professor on His Firing and Why He’s Suing\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/heartbreaking-and-cruel-a-texas-state-professor-on-his-firing-and-why-hes-suing\n\nAlter, an associate professor of history at Texas State University, was perplexed. He knew remarks he had made at a conference three days earlier about a hypothetical “overthrow” of the U.S. government, documented on the internet, had provoked an online campaign against him, but the last time he checked, the posts had received very little attention.\n\n\nThis stunning turnaround time is at the core of Alter’s lawsuit against the university, which he filed Tuesday and shared with The Chronicle. In Alter’s telling, he was fired “without an ounce of due process,” a loaded term in the American judicial system but one that carries an added weight for someone of Alter’s status: He was tenured — as of 10 days before his firing.\n\n\nWhen he began his remarks on that Sunday, Alter introduced himself by name and by his membership with Socialist Horizon, one of the groups organizing the conference, and his union, the Texas State Employees Union. Alter told The Chronicle said he was “very conscious” not to identify himself as a Texas State professor, and while a participant identified Alter’s employment as part of an “innocuous conversation” about how many teachers Texas State educates, Alter would probably have been just another participant had it not been for Borysenko.\n\n\nAn online influencer who calls herself an “anti-communist fascist leading the revolution against the revolution,” Borysenko recorded Alter’s remarks in full. The next day, September 8, she uploaded several videos across social media, including YouTube and X, with pointed captions identifying Alter and her interpretation of his remarks.\n\n\nPartisan Fury Got Him a Presidency. And Then It Took Him Down.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/partisan-fury-got-him-a-presidency-and-then-it-took-him-down\n\nWelsh was hastily named A&M’s interim president in 2023 after the proposed hiring of a new journalism director, Kathleen O. McElroy, infuriated conservatives who saw her as a champion of the kinds of diversity programs that, in Texas, were already on the outs. Replacing M. Katherine Banks, who had resigned the A&M presidency over the McElroy ordeal, Welsh faced a politically tricky task: making himself both palatable to conservatives, who were skeptical of creeping liberalism at A&M, and acceptable to beleaguered university faculty, who felt academic freedom was under threat. For a while, at least, Welsh seemed to pull it off.\n\n\nIn recent days, however, Welsh’s juggling act fell apart. In trying to appease both conservatives and faculty, he managed to satisfy neither. The politics that engulfed Welsh are indicative of a larger national trend, in which college leaders are struggling — to varying degrees — to uphold fundamental values of institutional autonomy and academic freedom in the face of a broad conservative effort to reshape higher education. Very few, it seems, are striking a balance that pleases either side.\n\n\nThis [several dismissals] still was not enough. Harrison continued to make media appearances and post about the events, often tagging the Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, and the Texas A&M University System chancellor, Glenn Hegar. Abbott-appointed regents, Harrison wrote, were “pushing transgender indoctrination on students.” The state’s lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, said last week that Welsh “did not handle the recent situation … as he should have,” but said his fate should be left up to the regents.\n\n\nIt was the regents, along with Hegar, who announced Thursday that Welsh would resign. But it was Harrison [Republican state elected] who took the credit, telling The Texas Tribune that his social-media posts hastened Welsh’s resignation. Swift action like this, Harrison told the outlet, is what “I firmly believe Texans want.”\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor sues West Point, says the academy is restricting free speech | AP News\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/west-point-lawsuit-first-amendment-professor-a4db138011c6fb9c8b445ce5a106aac2\n\nThe U.S. Military Academy at West Point is banning opinions by professors in the classroom and some books and courses in a crackdown that violates the First Amendment, a law professor at the military school said in a lawsuit Monday seeking class action status.\n\n\nBakken also noted in the lawsuit that he has a contract with a publisher for a book that is critical of some aspects of West Point and doesn’t want to seek approval from the school’s leadership prior to its publication because “it is very likely such approval will be withheld.”\n\n\nBakken’s lawsuit said the school began to scrutinize faculty speech after a January executive order from President Donald Trump to “carefully review the leadership, curriculum and instructors of the United States Service Academies and other defense academic institutions.”\n\n\nThe lawsuit said the academy in the spring withdrew books from its library, removed words and phrases from faculty members’ syllabi, eliminated courses and majors and threatened or punished faculty members for teaching, speaking and writing without prior approval from the school.\n\n\nDuring the summer, the academy removed information about faculty members’ published books, articles, essays and scholarship entries from all faculty members’ webpages on the school’s website, the lawsuit said. It also directed instructors not to express opinions in the classroom, it said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal judge orders Trump to restore $500 million in frozen UCLA medical research grants - Los Angeles Times\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-22/rita-lin-federal-judge-restores-ucla-nih-grants\n\nA federal judge Monday ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in UCLA medical research grants, halting for now a nearly two-month funding crisis that UC leaders said threatened the future of the nation’s premier public university system.\n\n\nLin’s order provides the biggest relief to UCLA but affects federal funding awarded to all 10 UC campuses. Lin ruled that the NIH grants were suspended by form letters that were unspecific to the research, a likely violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, which regulates executive branch rulemaking.\n\n\nIn addition to the medical grant freezes — which had prompted talks of possible UCLA layoffs or closures of labs conducting cancer and stroke research, among other studies — Lin said the government would have to restore millions of dollars in Department of Defense and Department of Transportation grants to UC schools.\n\n\nLin explained her thinking during a hearing last week. She said the Trump administration committed a “fundamental sin” in its “un-reasoned mass terminations” of grants using “letters that don’t go through the required factors that the agency is supposed to consider.”\n\n\nErwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley law school, worked with Polsky and argued the case in front of Lin.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/blogs/the-trump-agenda/500-million-in-grant-funding-should-be-restored-to-uc-system-judge-rules\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/24/judge-restores-another-batch-frozen-grants-ucla\n\n\n\n\nThe Campus With a Front-Row Seat to Trump’s Attack on Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-campus-with-a-front-row-seat-to-trumps-attack-on-higher-ed\n\nThe influx of officers and troops can leave the impression of a campus under siege, an impression also reinforced by less visible interactions. The day after President Trump announced the deployment of the National Guard in Washington, GW received a letter from the Justice Department announcing it had found the campus administration responsible for “deliberate indifference” to the “hostile environment” for Jewish, American-Israeli, and Israeli students and faculty.\n\n\nA week after the DOJ letter [Department of Justice’s “deliberate indifference” letter in August] was published, the GW student socialist organization released its own demands, co-signed by 45 student organizations, and posted an open letter about them. The six demands include banning all external law enforcement from campus, refusing compliance and capitulation with the Trump administration, and calling for the university to publicly declare its support for free speech. The demands also call for more communication and guidelines from the university regarding interacting with ICE and immigration authorities.",

Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a former top aide whom Mr. Adams describes as his “sister,” was indicted on money laundering and bribery charges for allegedly calling in favors in exchange for a bit part in an MGM+ streaming show and cash that her son used to buy a new Porsche.\n\n\nAnd it swept up almost every department in Mr. Adams’s administration — especially, and most importantly, the New York Police Department. The culture of impunity described in dozens of lawsuits, indictments and whistle-blower complaints was so widespread that one of the mayor’s own former police commissioners sued him for enforcing what the commissioner characterized as a culture of “lawlessness.”\n\n\nMr. Adams, a former police captain, has called himself the department’s “overbearing dad.” He installed his former cop friends at the top levels of the department and of his administration generally. Many of them padded out their entourages and gave their buddies cushy assignments and huge overtime payouts.\n\n\nShe responded with a shocking accusation in a complaint to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission: Her boss, the chief of department, Jeff Maddrey, had pressured her into serving that overtime with him at 1 Police Plaza, where he repeatedly sexually abused her. “I keep saying, ‘stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.’ And he just kept on,” the lieutenant, a 19-year veteran of the force and a mother of three, recalled, heaving with tears, in a televised interview last March. “This guy is a monster.” She said Chief Maddrey, a friend and an ally of Mr. Adams’s for more than 20 years, demanded a kickback from the overtime pay and even told her to pay for a vacation for him and his wife.\n\n\nAfter the lieutenant came forward with her accusations, nude videos of her circulated on police group chats. Then the Police Department tried to claw back the overtime money that her predator boss allegedly coerced her into taking.\n\n\n“I’m a former creationist. Here’s why ‘follow the science’ failed. The moment I finally admitted that Darwin was right didn’t feel liberating. It felt like grief.”\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/09/22/muslim-missionary-evolutionary-biologist-human/\n(Thanks BE!)\n\nAs an 18-year-old Muslim missionary, I enrolled at University College London intent on destroying the theory of evolution. I arrived on a mission: I wanted to prove that Charles Darwin was wrong. Like so many other creationists, I believed scientists were either lying to us or they were so biased that they were unknowingly misreading the data. The only way to dismantle their theory was to inspect the data for myself and prove it wrong.\n\n\nTwo decades later, I am an evolutionary biologist. Working on a documentary about our species’ 300,000-year-old story made me reflect on my own evolution — and how, when you ask people to do something simple such as “believe the science,” you might actually be asking them to pay an almost unimaginable price.\n\n\nBy and large, we share the opinions of our tribe. So when we ask people to believe in climate modeling or vaccine science, what we are really asking people to do is choose between their community’s beliefs and an abstract dataset. It’s a direct referendum on the people they know and love. Most people will not betray their tribe for a stranger in a lab coat.\n\n\nIn biological terms, this is an extremely rational predisposition — or, put another way, it’s human nature. And it’s the main reason simply shouting “trust the science” will never truly change people’s minds.\n\n\nIn many ways, I traded a warm religious community for a cold and often selfish secular world.\n\n\nUnderstanding these dynamics can illuminate the current quagmire of science and politics. When people of faith and political conservatives see their views mocked, dismissed or ostracized, they begin to see science not as a method but as a tribe they’re not a part of. And once science becomes just another tribe, its authority collapses.\n\n\nIn the 13 years since I left my missionary world, many Muslims have embraced evolution. That progress didn’t come from outsiders or even nonpracticing Muslims like me; it came from scholars, thinkers and activists who argued for the compatibility of Islam and evolution. It is why we must tolerate religious and, for that matter, right-wing viewpoints more. Not only is more robust science achieved when all biases are represented, but the perception of left-wing atheists having a monopoly on science is a disaster. The best ambassadors to skeptical communities are people from within those communities.\n\n\nEvolution is the underlying assumption of biology; nothing in the field makes sense without it. It should trouble us that so many people still reject it. Paradigm shifts are possible, although parting with the beliefs of one’s tribe is an enormous decision. Empathy for that hesitation, not scorn for it, is the way forward.\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls. The shortened wapo links are gift articles; the Chronicle links should be available through a CUNY library. I have online access to the WSJ articles through CUNY.\nThese digests are now archived at\nhttps://cunytracker.github.io/CUNYTracker/",

Please see a brief primer on SAR’s work attached below for your reference.\n\n\nWe would greatly appreciate your sharing of the following information regarding our upcoming SAR US Mid-Atlantic Regional Conference, taking place October 9-10 at New York University with interested members of the CUNY University Faculty Senate (UFS).\n\n\nThe event, titled “Working Together to Protect Scholars and Promote Academic Freedom,” will feature SAR programming on both local and global responses to pressures on academic freedom. The meeting will offer networking opportunities, reflections on responses to attacks on higher education in both the US and worldwide, the launch of SAR’s Free to Think 2025 report, and most notably, the launch of SAR’s 25th Anniversary year themed “Truth Matters.”\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Isn’t Fixing America’s Campuses. He’s Bleeding Them Dry.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/opinion/trump-colleges-universities.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Another story that take too long to get to the point and only gets there to say there are problems, but… still)\n\nBut what Trump and his allies are doing is no targeted effort to correct that. It’s a sweeping, indiscriminate, performative smackdown of elite institutions by a crew trying to solidify its power under the banner of anti-elitism. It doesn’t attempt to usher those institutions from a place of bias and extremism to one of neutrality and moderation. It answers excess with excess, orthodoxy with orthodoxy, censorship with censorship. And it disregards the damage it’s doing.\n\n\nBecause that’s what’s happening now. With debatable authority and without any consultation with Congress, Trump is using the suspension of federal grants, threats of further cuts and demands that schools essentially pay fines for their supposed transgressions to get them to do as he pleases. That’s not a discussion; it’s intimidation. That’s not accountability; it’s extortion. He extracted $200 million from Columbia. He’s reportedly looking for $500 million from Harvard and more than $1 billion from U.C.L.A. Why these targets? They’re politically juicy. These sums? They’re attention-grabbing. He’s staging a show of force. A spectacle of punishment.\n\n\nAnd an illogical one at that. His and his allies’ principal grievances are with professors and courses in the humanities, in the social sciences, which are the realms where white supremacy and structural racism are studied. So they’re slowing money to … Alzheimer’s research? Gumming up or dragging down investigations into the causes and treatments of other diseases? Slashing studies of sea-level rise and flooding because they trigger “climate anxiety”? How does that fight antisemitism? It’s the DOGE approach, sadistic and sloppy: Inflict pain with no regard for what and who are really being hurt, because the true goal is to assert dominance, shrink others’ influence and please your supporters by destroying something in particular that they’ve decided to hate and smashing the status quo in general.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: The Typical College Student Is Not Who You Think It Is\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/us/us-typical-college-student.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(The typical student looks a lot like a typical CUNY student)\n\n43 percent of undergraduates attend community college\n\n\nAbout 75 percent of community college students are enrolled part time\n\n\n20 percent of all undergraduate students are parents\n\n\n1.4 million undergraduate students with children are single mothers\n\n\n10.3 million students take at least some classes online\n\n\n26 percent of students take classes exclusively online\n\n\n25 percent of all undergraduate students live with their parents\n\n\nThe average student is $19,000 in debt\n\n\n10.8 million students owe more than $44,000\n\n\nTwo-thirds of student loan debt belong to women\n\n\nAbout a third of all undergraduate students received a Pell Grant\n\n\n41 million people attended college but never graduated\n\n\nToo many college students\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/08/27/college-students-degrees-jobs/\n(Thanks BE. The old right wing way of trying to rationalize the unrational, if you ask me)\n\nSince 1990, college enrollment has increased by 6 million students (29 percent). Reasons for this include government tuition subsidies and “college for everyone” rhetoric. And “degree inflation”: irrational requirements for job applicants.\n\n\nIn 1990, 9 percent of secretaries and administrative professionals had bachelor’s degrees; today, 33 percent do, and a higher proportion of job listings require applicants to have one. This “paper ceiling” is especially egregious in state and local governments, where 63 percent of those earning between $40,000 and $60,000 have bachelor’s degrees or higher. Only 28 percent of such earners in the private sector do.\n\n\nA recent report from the Burning Glass Institute and the Strada Education Foundation says 52 percent of recent college graduates are underemployed: in jobs not using their college learning. Meanwhile there are 750,000 industrial jobs unfilled.\n\n\nEconomist Arnold Kling [Cato Institute type] says that despite the limited “natural demand” for college education (“students who are excited by academic subjects”), graduate schools continue to churn out more PhDs (almost 60,000 in 2022) than the growth of undergraduate enrollment justifies. So, artificial student demand must be stimulated. Kling says “colleges adapt by offering dumbed-down courses and grade inflation.\n\n\nAnd by teachers teaching less. Hess and Richard B. Keck, also of AEI [Also center right], say light teaching loads have become badges of professional status — and require schools to rely on teaching by graduate students or part-time adjunct instructors.\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Texas System ends faculty senates to comply with SB 37\n\nhttps://www.statesman.com/news/education/article/university-texas-system-faculty-senate-abolish-20822502.php\n(Thanks KK!)\n\nFaculty senates — a long-standing advisory body of elected members that helps university leadership on curriculum, policy and programs — will no longer exist at University of Texas institutions starting Sept. 1, after the UT System Board of Regents on Thursday approved compliance with Senate Bill 37.\n\n\nChairman Kevin Eltife said the board will “take their time” deciding if faculty senates compliant with the law will be reinstated to university campuses, and may not be needed at all 14 campuses.\n\n\nIn the meantime, the board authorizes university presidents to create “faculty advisory groups” for leaders to consult as needed and to complete the essential work previously done by the faculty senate.\n\n\nSen. Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe, authored SB 37 to give regents more control following complaints from conservatives that the institution’s faculty have become too liberal or “woke.”\n\n\n\n\n\nOhio State Restricts Decorations in Public Dorm Spaces\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/27/ohio-state-restricts-decorations-public-dorm-spaces\n\nThe move comes partly in response to SB1, a higher ed law Ohio passed in March that prohibits DEI, requires institutions to “demonstrate intellectual diversity” and mandates institutional neutrality on “controversial” subjects such as climate change, electoral politics, foreign policy, immigration, marriage and abortion.\n\n\nStudents took to Reddit to pan the new decorating rules, with one commenter posting, “SB1 and university leadership has sucked the life out of literally everything.”\n\n\nFEMA employees put on leave after criticizing Trump administration in open letter\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/08/26/fema-employees-leave-trump-administration-letter/\n\nThe Trump administration placed more than 30 Federal Emergency Management Agency employees on leave Tuesday after they signed an open letter of dissent about the agency’s leadership, according to people familiar with the situation and documents reviewed by The Washington Post.\n\n\n\n\nHow Leo Terrell Is Helping Trump “Root Out” Antisemitism on College Campuses — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/leo-terrell-universities-lawsuits-antisemitism\n\nTerrell, meanwhile, rebranded himself as “Leo 2.0,” complete with red Trump-style caps he offered for sale online. Leo 1.0 had slammed Trump for cozying up to white supremacists, blamed him for a surge in violent attacks on Jews and donated to Democrats. Leo 2.0? He attacked “DEI nonsense,” compared Black Lives Matter to ISIS and declared the 2020 election was “stolen from President Trump and America!”\n\n\nIn January, Terrell was rewarded for his loyalty when President-elect Trump, praising him as a “highly respected civil rights attorney and political analyst” with an “incredibly successful career,” named him senior counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Justice Department. Terrell assumed his marquee role a month later: as head of the multiagency Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism.\n\n\nBut his zealous conversion and penchant for media bombast made him a perfect bullhorn for the task force’s actual mission: to strong-arm colleges into stripping away any vestige of “wokeness” in their hiring, admissions, classes and research.\n\n\nIn service of that goal, the government has abandoned due process in favor of media warfare, preemptive declarations of guilt and freezes on billions in critical federal funding.\n\n\nSo far, the campaign has been effective. To preserve hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants and contracts, Columbia and Brown have struck deals with the administration that cost them $220 million and $50 million, respectively, and go far beyond pledging tougher action to combat antisemitism. Columbia agreed to open academic programs and admissions decisions to outside monitoring. Brown pledged to ban transgender women from single-sex spaces and women’s sports. Harvard has sued the administration to try to unfreeze $2.6 billion in federal research funds, but it’s also trying to negotiate a settlement. Meanwhile, colleges nationwide are eliminating any remaining vestiges of diversity, equity and inclusion programs and shuttering multicultural centers lest the government come after them.\n\n\nThe portrait that emerged is dramatically at odds with Trump’s description of a “highly respected” and “incredibly successful” attorney. Peers in civil rights law said they always considered Terrell a minor player. Documents reveal a distinctly mixed legal track record, marred by malpractice suits, client disputes and mishandling a criminal case so badly that a federal appeals court lambasted his work as “woeful.”\n\n(And you were hoping for something beyond woeful.

But the rate of visa issuance for master’s students is only about half what it has been in previous years, according to David Di Maria, UMBC’s vice provost for global engagement\n\n\nrump Deals A New Immigration Blow To International Students\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2025/08/28/trump-deals-a-new-immigration-blow-to-international-students/\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed a new rule to limit international students to fixed periods of entry, making enrolling at U.S. universities more precarious. Educators warn that if Trump officials finalize the rule, fewer international students will come to America. The regulation represents the most recent action by the Trump administration restricting international students and should be viewed in that context. Immigration data for July 2025 showed a significant decline in the arrival of international students compared to the same period a year earlier, including a drop of almost 50% for students from India. The proposed rule will increase bureaucracy and red tape for employers by including an unrelated measure to eliminate deference to prior findings of fact in adjudications.\n\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow have indicated they do not want international students to remain and work in the United States after completing their coursework. The proposed rule has a 30-day comment period. Barring litigation blocking the rule, it is expected to become final before the Fall 2026 academic year.\n\n\nThe four-year limit will likely be insufficient for many international students. The National Center for Education Statistics reports a median of 52 months (4.3 years) for completing a bachelor’s degree. The National Science Foundation reports a median of 5.7 years for completing a Ph.D.\n\n\nNYTimes: International Student Enrollments Stay Steady at Columbia and Princeton\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/29/us/international-students-race-affirmative-action-princeton-columbia.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut Black student enrollment is lower at the two universities after years of turmoil in elite higher education.\n\n\nColumbia’s Black and Hispanic enrollment was similar to last year, when the percentage of Black students saw significant declines in the wake of the court ruling. At Princeton, where Black enrollment had not previously seen much change, the university reported a notable drop in Black enrollment this year, even as the percentage of Hispanic admits remained stable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe State of Independent Technology Research 2025\n\nhttps://independenttechresearch.org/citr-report-2025/\nhttps://independenttechresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The-State-of-Independent-Technology-Research-Power-in-Numbers.pdf\n\nYet still today, more than thirty-five years after the invention of the Web, over 20 years since the dawn of social media, and on the brink of rapid technological advances in AI, the public still has a shocking lack of clarity about the impacts that technology is having on society. Basic questions about how these systems are designed, what data trains them, and whether they will deepen inequality or enable liberation remain largely unanswered. Much of the research that does exist comes from within the tech industry itself, conducted by employees who sign nondisclosure agreements and whose findings can be suppressed or ignored by corporate executives.\n\n\nIncomplete data access fundamentally undermines the breadth and depth of social media research. When researchers can only see what users clicked on, liked, or shared, they miss the vast majority of content that appeared in users’ feeds but went unnoticed. This creates a distorted picture, almost like trying to understand a movie by only watching the scenes that made audiences applaud. Without seeing the content landscape, researchers cannot accurately assess whether harmful content is being effectively moderated or simply ignored, how algorithmic recommendations are truly personalized or systematically biased, or how information flows through social networks.\n\n\nDOJ Deems Definition of HSIs Unconstitutional, Won’t Defend\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/minority-serving-institutions/2025/08/22/doj-deems-definition-hsis\n\nThe country’s roughly 600 Hispanic-serving institutions are in peril of losing hundreds of millions of dollars annually from the federal government, after the Department of Justice said it won’t defend the program against a lawsuit alleging the way HSIs are currently defined is unconstitutional. The suit challenges the requirement that a college or university’s undergraduate population must be at least a quarter Hispanic to receive HSI funding.\n\n(CUNY has several such institutions)\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon, a conservative outlet, first reported on the letter Friday. The DOJ subsequently provided Inside Higher Ed with the letter but gave no further comment or interviews.\n\n(The Free Beacon is always being given such scoops, hmm such diligent reporting)\n\n“There are proposals to the Department of Education right now that they said they were going to allocate,” Santiago [co-founder and chief executive officer of Excelencia in Education] said, noting that the program was set to dole out more than $350 million this fiscal year—money that institutions use for faculty development, facilities and other purposes.\n\n\n“The value of a program like this has really been investing in institutions that have a high concentration of low-income, first-generation students,” Santiago said.\n\n\nTrump’s Funding Freezes Against Universities in 5 Charts\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/2025/08/28/trumps-funding-freezes-against-universities-5-charts\n\n“All told, the tradeoff put to Harvard and other universities is clear: Allow the Government to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardize the institution’s ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions,” the university’s lawyers wrote in the initial complaint.\n\n\nAlthough only a few institutions have been affected, Fansmith said other college presidents should be concerned that they could face a similar penalty. Supporting a transgender student or having policies that the administration disagrees with could trigger a freeze, he added.\n\n\n“What [Trump officials] have shown is they will not follow the rules and the laws in a way that gives you some sense of what compliance actually looks like, because it’s irrelevant,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nOpinion | Trump Is Defunding Medical Research.

Dr. David Ho is trying to make breakthroughs in H.I.V. research.\n\n\nThese researchers and so many others worked to ensure that Americans had access to the best medical treatments available and that they had first access to those treatments. That is, they worked until Trump administration gutted funding to the National Institutes of Health and froze grants to universities across the country.

I think the best way to deal with that is to talk about examples.\n\n\nI’ll reflect on my experience with cystic fibrosis research. The effort to try to do something for that almost-uniformly fatal disease started as a basic science enterprise to try to discover the nature of the gene that is misspelled. That was a hard slog back in the 1980s. Nobody would have supported [research into it] except NIH.\n\n\nNow, 30 years after the gene discovery, young people with cystic fibrosis are planning for retirement instead of an early funeral.\n\n\nSCOTUS Ruling Has “Bleak Implications” for Researchers\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/08/25/scotus-ruling-has-bleak-implications-researchers\n\nResearchers sued the NIH in April and got a win in June when a federal district court judge in Massachusetts ordered the agency to reinstate the grants immediately. Although the NIH has since reinstated many of those grants, Scott Delaney, an epidemiologist at Harvard University and former lawyer who’s been tracking grant cancellations, told Inside Higher Ed that after Thursday’s ruling those reinstated grants will “almost certainly” be re-terminated. If that happens, “I don’t think they’ll get their money back.”\n\n\n“Nobody has that kind of time. The nature of research is that you can’t just stop and restart it many months later,” said Delaney. “Folks have already had to do that once and many aren’t able to—they’ve had to lay off staff and lost contact with study participants. This additional delay probably renders the research unviable going forward.”\n\n\n“Make no mistake: This was a decision critical to the future of the nation, and the Supreme Court made the wrong choice,” the Association of American Medical Colleges said in a statement. “History will look upon these mass NIH research grant terminations with shame. The Court has turned a blind eye to this grievous attack on science and medicine, and we call upon Congress to take action to restore the rule of law at NIH.”\n\n\nHe added that Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s dissent sums up his interpretation of the ruling’s implications. “This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist,” Jackson wrote. “Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: That one, and this Administration always wins.”\n\n\nNIH Publisher Fee Cap Plan ‘Not Comprehensive Enough,’ Critics Say\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/08/27/nih-publisher-fee-cap-plan-not-comprehensive\n\nThe agency, which is the nation’s largest funder of biomedical research, wants to do that by capping—or potentially disallowing—the amount of money it gives to NIH-funded researchers who want to make their work publicly accessible by paying publishers article processing charges. A July 30 request for information memo outlined five potential options, which the NIH says are all aimed at balancing the “feasibility of providing research results with maximizing the use of taxpayer funds to support research.”\n\n\nJay Bhattacharya, director of the NIH, has said the policy could be a mechanism for ending what he sees as the “perverse incentives” driving the $19 billion for-profit academic publishing industry and making it “much harder for a small number of scientific elite to say what’s true and false.”\n\n\n\n\n\nHHS Ends Minority Biomedical Research Support Program\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/27/hhs-ends-minority-biomedical-research-support-program\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department has terminated the Minority Biomedical Research Support program, which provided colleges and universities grants to increase the number of minority faculty, students and investigators conducting biomedical research.\n\n\nSTAT reported the move earlier. Rochelle Newman, a University of Maryland psychologist who used the grant to pay undergraduate researchers and train them, told STAT that “cutting of these programs means that an entire generation of students will end up being lost to science.”\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Grants for Area Studies and Foreign Language at Risk\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/08/25/federal-grants-area-studies-and-foreign-language-risk\n\nFor 67 years, the Department of Education has administered grants to universities to create centers devoted to foreign languages and area studies, a field focused on the study of the culture of a particular area or region. Now, those centers are under fire by the Trump administration, which has not released the funding the grantees expected to receive in July.\n\n\nThe grants support what are known as National Resource Centers, which were originally developed as a national security tool to help the U.S. increase its international expertise in the midst of the Cold War and the aftermath of Soviet Union’s 1957 launch of Sputnik. Since then, their purpose has shifted with the times, now focusing not only on producing scholars but also on community outreach and collaboration with K–12 schools.\n\n\nThe funding cuts appear to be caused by the Office of Management and Budget; records show that the agency has not approved appropriations for programs formerly housed in IFLE, including the NRC program, as well as the Foreign Language and Area Studies fellowships, which fund scholarships and stipends for undergraduate and graduate students studying these disciplines. In total, about $85 million was appropriated for IFLE programs for FY 2025–26, including $60 million for NRCs and FLAS.\n\n\nDems Claim ED Is Making It Harder for Students to File Financial Aid Complaints\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/26/its-more-difficult-file-student-aid-complaints-dems-say\n\n“ED is covering up its attempts to make [the Office of Federal Student Aid] less responsive to millions of students, families, and borrowers who rely on the agency to lower the cost of attending college and protect them from loan servicer misconduct,” the senators wrote. “We urge you to immediately act on our findings by streamlining the ‘Submit a Complaint’ process and restoring FSA’s workforce so borrowers can get the help they need.”\n\n\nIn the letter, Warren states that she told FSA in March that the button for submitting online complaints had been “hidden.” The department responded in April that the button had just been moved from the top of the webpage to the footer and relabeled as “submit feedback.” The department added that no employees who handle technical functions of the aid applications of loan servicing had been laid off, and while some employees that handle complaints were, the remaining employees will “still be responding” to future complaints.\n\n\nBut the Democrats say they tested those claims and found the department’s reassurances were misleading. Although the department did move and rename the complaint button, it also added a series of four extra navigation clicks that must be made before the user actually reaches the webpage where they can file a complaint.

It’s my top priority to ensure every New York student feels safe at school, and I will continue to take action against campus discrimination and use every tool at my disposal to eliminate hate and bias from our school communities.”\n\n\nThe State University of New York system had already mandated each of its campuses to bring on a Title VI coordinator by the fall 2025 semester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration is warning schools against using application essays, geography and other “unlawful proxies” for race to achieve diverse student bodies\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trumps-next-fight-with-universities-racial-proxies-in-admissions-c8677633?st=c9YJRf&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nIn late July, Attorney General Pam Bondi warned in a memo against using “unlawful proxies” for race—such as geography or applicant essays on overcoming hardships—in admissions. Soon after, the U.S. Education Department announced it would require universities to report new data on applicants, broken down by race, to “ensure race-based preferences are not used.”\n\n\n“There’s an effort to say that the law is something that it’s not. There’s an effort to say that it’s illegal to seek to have a diverse student body,” said Peter McDonough, general counsel for the American Council on Education, a university lobbying group.\n\n\n“Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life,” Roberts added. However, “universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today.”\n\n\nThe University of California system has been complying with California’s ban on affirmative action for decades, said spokesman Omar Rodriguez. “At the same time, we remain committed to expanding access for all qualified students,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch out for middle states\n\n(Thanks BE)\n\nTrouble at Columbia (non-compliance warning on Standard 2); trouble at KBCC (required to submit extensive suplemental material on budget); 3) trouble at Matropolitan College (non-compliance show cause based on not meeting Standard 4—Planning, resources, and Institutional improvement\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Harvard, Trump administration cuts hit young scientists hard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/08/24/harvard-grad-students-research-cuts/\n\nThe cuts and uncertainty could disrupt the science pipeline and threaten experiments targeting cancer, autism, quantum physics, military robotics and hundreds of other realms, including Scully’s work in systems biology. At Harvard, more than 700 graduate students and nearly 800 postdoctoral researchers get their salaries, stipends or tuition support from federally funded research, according to court documents. Early-career researchers such as Scully are most at risk.\n\n\nPeople are panicking, said Henri Garrison-Desany, who was a research fellow in public health at Harvard but amid hiring and funding freezes spent this summer teaching yoga. “I’m just really sad about how much it is turning research back decades in the span of months,” he said, “and really derailing people’s careers.”\n\n\nThe government had been a trusted partner, said Elisabeth Stelson, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard’s school of public health, but it now seems to be harming the things scientists care about most.\n\n\nPeople are watching years of their life’s work evaporate so quickly, she said. “We feel like the lost generation.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Is Making Changes Trump Officials Want, Even Without a Deal\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/23/us/harvard-changes-academic-freedom-trump-deal.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut it has also taken a host of steps that align with the White House’s desires, checking off items on the administration’s detailed menu, which have ranged from eliminating diversity offices to ousting program leaders. In some cases, students and faculty members worry, the new, Trump-inspired policies may interfere with the freedom of expression that is central to the university’s mission.\n\n\nPresident Trump and his appointees have made their attack on Harvard a totem for the changes they want to see across America’s elite universities, using the government’s blunt power to force compliance in a manner never before seen. Universities across the country are watching closely, to see what Harvard might do and what it might be willing to sacrifice, as they seek a way forward for their own campuses.\n\n\nThe Trump administration’s demands included eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs. In April, Harvard renamed its Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, which is now called the Office for Community and Campus Life. More recently, Harvard also took down websites for its Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, as well as websites for companion offices for gay and female students, and said they were merging them into a new, single center.\n\n\nThe government has also sought leadership shake-ups in certain departments, including the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, after Jewish alumni and others accused the programs of sponsoring antisemitic programming. Harvard removed two of the center’s leaders, including Cemal Kafadar, a leading Turkish scholar, in March.\n\n\nAnd Trump officials asked for an end to Harvard’s partnership with Birzeit University, a top Palestinian college in the West Bank. Harvard said it had suspended the relationship and had struck up new ones with institutions in Israel.\n\n\nThe A.A.U.P. is, for now, pressing forward with its own lawsuit against the Trump administration, even as Harvard would be likely to resolve, as part of any deal with the White House, the two federal court cases it filed. One seeks the restoration of $2.2 billion in funding that has been frozen or withdrawn by the federal government. Another opposes the Trump administration’s efforts to block international students.\n\n\nWill the Supreme Court’s Ruling on Research Grants Sink Harvard’s Lawsuit Against Trump?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/will-the-supreme-courts-ruling-on-research-grants-sink-harvards-lawsuit-against-trump\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Got Most of Its Research Funding Back.

Columbia’s School of Public Health and medical center remain in austerity mode, with fewer slots for Ph.D. students and hiring delays caused by the original suspension of funding.\n\n\nAnd looming over the deal, researchers said, is a bleak national outlook for federal science funding, making some scientists feel as if they dodged a bullet only to face the possibility of a firing squad.\n\n\nAn Aug. 7 executive order signed by President Trump, for example, requires additional review of federal scientific grant awards to ensure that they are “consistent with agency priorities and the national interest.” The White House has also proposed a 40 percent cut to the budget of the National Institutes of Health, the main source of medical research funding from the federal government, although a Senate committee has resisted the steep reduction.\n\n\nStill, the overall funding picture means that some damage cannot be contained. As Washington debates the cuts to science funding, Columbia and other research universities have instituted hiring freezes, cut expenses and reduced the number of students they will educate.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Law Firm Pressures Brown University to Erase Research on Anti-Wind Groups\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/climate/brown-university-offshore-wind-marzulla.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nA law firm representing opponents of offshore wind farms is demanding that Brown University retract research that details links between the fossil fuel industry and anti-wind groups.\n\n\nThe demands come at a precarious time for the nation’s universities, which have become targets of a pressure campaign conducted by the Trump administration. Last month, Brown struck a deal with the government to restore lost federal research funding and end investigations into alleged discrimination.\n\n\nThe Trump administration is trying to stop the country’s nascent wind industry, a source of energy that President Trump has disparaged since he failed to stop an offshore wind farm from being built within view of one of his Scottish golf courses.\n\n\nMarzulla Law L.L.C. is representing several groups that are fighting offshore wind, including Green Oceans, a nonprofit organization that is trying to overturn federal permits for Revolution Wind, a 65-turbine wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island.\n\n\nIn an Aug. 11 letter to Brown’s general counsel, Mr. Marzulla objected to research published by the Climate and Development Lab at Brown that found that Green Oceans had spread misinformation about climate change and operated as part of “a fossil-fuel-funded disinformation network.”\n\n\nJ. Timmons Roberts, who leads the Climate and Development Lab, said in an interview that his students had found that groups fighting offshore wind “have chosen to get in bed with some of the most anti-environment and anti-climate actors.” He called the letter “strategic harassment to shut me up and waste my time and make me more cautious.”\n\n\n\n\n\nEd Dept.

It also wants the institution to begin an annual training session for all individuals involved in recruitment, hiring, promotion or tenure decisions to emphasize the ban on racial consideration and provide records documenting compliance whenever they are requested moving forward.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/education-dept-finds-faculty-diversity-efforts-at-george-mason-u-were-discriminatory\n\nGeorge Mason Must Not Comply With the Government’s Demands (opinion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/08/25/george-mason-must-not-comply-governments-demands-opinion\n\nThe message to George Mason, where I was a professor of public policy for nearly two decades, is clear: Equity is now presented as a civil rights violation.\n\n\nTitle VI was meant to prevent discrimination, not to penalize institutions for recognizing that diversity matters. With courts allowing the consideration of diversity as one factor among many in holistic decisions, OCR’s stance appears to be a politically motivated shift away from long-standing interpretations—not a clear enforcement of the law. Just last week, a federal judge “struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation’s schools and universities,” the Associated Press reported.\n\n\nMost alarming in OCR’s proposed resolutions is the demand for a personal apology from the university’s first Black president. Washington, who called for eliminating racist legacies on campus, is now being compelled to apologize for doing just that. This isn’t simply an institutional issue—it’s a deeply symbolic act that resembles public shaming of a leader of color for advocating inclusion. It evokes the disturbing history of targeting minority leaders through law and policy.\n\n\nHere again, ideology replaces impartial curation. A common thread emerges: Whether in higher education or national museums, diversity and sincere historical reflection are viewed not as civic strengths but as transgressions. Institutional autonomy and academic governance are being subordinated to partisan narratives.\n\n\nUniversities must remain havens of reasoned inquiry, honest history and inclusive excellence. When federal agencies start dictating not only policy but the exact language leaders must use, we enter coercive territory.\n\n\nThis moment is a clarion call for universities. Yesterday, it was the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard, dragged through headline-grabbing investigations. It was New College of Florida, where political appointees dismantled DEI programs and faculty governance. It was the University of Virginia, accused by the Department of Justice of defying federal antidiscrimination laws. Today it is Mason. Tomorrow, it could be UCLA, Michigan, Wisconsin or any other institution that values diversity, equity and academic freedom. No campus—public or private, flagship or regional—should assume it is immune.\n\n\nGeorge Mason should reject the department’s findings and oppose this injustice. Capitulation is not compliance; it’s surrender.\n\n\nGMU President Rejects OCR Findings\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/25/gmu-president-refuses-apologize-rejects-ocr-findings\n\nIn a letter to GMU’s board Monday, Washington’s attorney, Douglas F. Gansler, alleged that OCR cut its fact-finding efforts short and only interviewed two university deans before reaching the conclusions the Department of Education published Friday. Gansler wrote that “OCR’s letter contains gross mischaracterizations of statements made by Dr. Washington and outright omissions” related to the university’s DEI practices.\n\n\nGansler also accused OCR of selectively interpreting various remarks by Washington, the first Black president in GMU’s history.\n\n\n“To be clear, per OCR’s own findings, no job applicant has been discriminated against by GMU, nor has OCR attempted to name someone who has been discriminated against by GMU in any context. Therefore, it is a legal fiction for OCR to even assert or claim that there has been a Title VI or Title IX violation here,” Gansler wrote in a 10-page letter.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/gmu-president-refuses-to-apologize-for-diversity-efforts-calls-ed-dept-claims-absurd\n(and)\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/08/25/george-mason-president-refuses-apology-dei/\n\nVirginia Democrats reject more of Youngkin’s picks for college boards\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/28/schools-youngkin-virginia-george-mason/\n\nA panel of Virginia senators on Thursday rejected more of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s picks to serve on college boards, intensifying a showdown between the administration and lawmakers and plunging the state’s institutions of higher education into legal limbo.\n\n\nMembers of the state Senate’s Privileges and Elections committee voted 6 to 8 along party lines against 14 people who the Republican governor nominated to sit on governing boards at George Mason University, the University of Virginia and the Virginia Military Institute.\n\n\nDemocrats have now refused to seat a total of 22 people in two months on college boards based on concerns about their qualifications, backgrounds and intentions. The senators have said appointees that the committee rejects can no longer serve on the boards, an argument disputed by the state’s top Republicans.\n\n\nThe Thursday vote by Senate Democrats could have broad implications at George Mason in Northern Virginia, which is left with only six confirmed members on its 16-seat board. The bylaws for the governing board require eight members to constitute a quorum.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoward President Steps Down, Former President Appointed Interim\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/25/howard-president-steps-down-former-president-appointed-interim\n\nUniversity officials declined to comment about why Vinson is leaving only two years after he took up the helm\n\n\nBut the past year has also brought its share of challenges.

They included rebuilding highways, new underpasses and overpasses, and pedestrian and bike trails. The biggest included in G.O.P.-held districts included $147 million to design and build a 30-mile trail in Jacksonville, Fla., represented by Representative Aaron Bean; and $74.9 million to rebuild a highway in Missoula, Mont., represented by Representative Ryan Zinke; and the project in St. George, represented by Representative Celeste Maloy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSCIMaP – map of impact of NIH cuts\n\nhttps://scienceimpacts.org/\n\n\n\n\nFewer Young People See Math Skills as Very Important in Work\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/student-success/academic-life/2025/08/25/fewer-young-people-see-math-skills-very-important\n\nTabanli said it can be hard to convince many Gen Z and Alpha students that math content is necessary for their daily lives, in part because access to information is so convenient and they can perform calculations on their phones or online.\n\n\nOne reason a young adult might not rate math skills highly is because many students face undue math anxiety or a skepticism about their own ability to do math, falling into the belief that they’re not “math people,” Tabanli said.\n\n\nIn response, Tabanli believes professors should help students apply computational skills to their daily lives or link content to other classes to encourage students to invest in their math learning. While this may be an additional step for a faculty member to take, Tabanli considers it a disservice to neglect this connection.\n\n\nThere is one way for colleges to defeat AI cheating—and it’s every student’s worst nightmare. Blue books are back.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/business/chatgpt-ai-cheating-college-blue-books-5e3014a6?st=4HNgEb&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nStudents outsourcing their assignments to AI and cheating their way through college has become so rampant, so quickly, that it has created a market for a product that helps professors ChatGPT-proof school. As it turns out, that product already exists. In fact, you’ve probably used it. You might even dread it.\n\n\nIt’s called a blue book.\n\n\nThe mere thought of that exam booklet with a blue cover and blank pages is enough to make generations of college kids clam up—and make their hands cramp up.\n\n\nBut inexpensive pamphlets of stapled paper have become a surprisingly valuable tool for teachers at a time when they need all the help they can get.\n\n\nAll of which explains how a paper company in Pennsylvania has unexpectedly found itself on the front lines of the classroom AI wars.\n\n\n\n\n\nCUNY Plans to Buy Manhattan Campus\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/29/cuny-plans-buy-manhattan-campus\n(Thanks VC!)\n\nCUNY is purchasing 101,542 square feet across three floors in the shared building, which officials told Bloomberg they intend to use as a temporary site for the Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing amid ongoing construction projects.

He’s Bleeding Them Dry.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/opinion/trump-colleges-universities.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Another story that take too long to get to the point and only gets there to say there are problems, but… still)\n\nBut what Trump and his allies are doing is no targeted effort to correct that. It’s a sweeping, indiscriminate, performative smackdown of elite institutions by a crew trying to solidify its power under the banner of anti-elitism. It doesn’t attempt to usher those institutions from a place of bias and extremism to one of neutrality and moderation. It answers excess with excess, orthodoxy with orthodoxy, censorship with censorship. And it disregards the damage it’s doing.\n\n\nBecause that’s what’s happening now. With debatable authority and without any consultation with Congress, Trump is using the suspension of federal grants, threats of further cuts and demands that schools essentially pay fines for their supposed transgressions to get them to do as he pleases. That’s not a discussion; it’s intimidation. That’s not accountability; it’s extortion. He extracted $200 million from Columbia. He’s reportedly looking for $500 million from Harvard and more than $1 billion from U.C.L.A. Why these targets? They’re politically juicy. These sums? They’re attention-grabbing. He’s staging a show of force. A spectacle of punishment.\n\n\nAnd an illogical one at that. His and his allies’ principal grievances are with professors and courses in the humanities, in the social sciences, which are the realms where white supremacy and structural racism are studied. So they’re slowing money to … Alzheimer’s research? Gumming up or dragging down investigations into the causes and treatments of other diseases? Slashing studies of sea-level rise and flooding because they trigger “climate anxiety”? How does that fight antisemitism? It’s the DOGE approach, sadistic and sloppy: Inflict pain with no regard for what and who are really being hurt, because the true goal is to assert dominance, shrink others’ influence and please your supporters by destroying something in particular that they’ve decided to hate and smashing the status quo in general.",

The old right wing way of trying to rationalize the unrational, if you ask me)\n\nSince 1990, college enrollment has increased by 6 million students (29 percent). Reasons for this include government tuition subsidies and “college for everyone” rhetoric. And “degree inflation”: irrational requirements for job applicants.\n\n\nIn 1990, 9 percent of secretaries and administrative professionals had bachelor’s degrees; today, 33 percent do, and a higher proportion of job listings require applicants to have one. This “paper ceiling” is especially egregious in state and local governments, where 63 percent of those earning between $40,000 and $60,000 have bachelor’s degrees or higher. Only 28 percent of such earners in the private sector do.\n\n\nA recent report from the Burning Glass Institute and the Strada Education Foundation says 52 percent of recent college graduates are underemployed: in jobs not using their college learning. Meanwhile there are 750,000 industrial jobs unfilled.\n\n\nEconomist Arnold Kling [Cato Institute type] says that despite the limited “natural demand” for college education (“students who are excited by academic subjects”), graduate schools continue to churn out more PhDs (almost 60,000 in 2022) than the growth of undergraduate enrollment justifies. So, artificial student demand must be stimulated. Kling says “colleges adapt by offering dumbed-down courses and grade inflation.\n\n\nAnd by teachers teaching less. Hess and Richard B. Keck, also of AEI [Also center right], say light teaching loads have become badges of professional status — and require schools to rely on teaching by graduate students or part-time adjunct instructors.",

Leo 1.0 had slammed Trump for cozying up to white supremacists, blamed him for a surge in violent attacks on Jews and donated to Democrats. Leo 2.0? He attacked “DEI nonsense,” compared Black Lives Matter to ISIS and declared the 2020 election was “stolen from President Trump and America!”\n\n\nIn January, Terrell was rewarded for his loyalty when President-elect Trump, praising him as a “highly respected civil rights attorney and political analyst” with an “incredibly successful career,” named him senior counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Justice Department. Terrell assumed his marquee role a month later: as head of the multiagency Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism.\n\n\nBut his zealous conversion and penchant for media bombast made him a perfect bullhorn for the task force’s actual mission: to strong-arm colleges into stripping away any vestige of “wokeness” in their hiring, admissions, classes and research.\n\n\nIn service of that goal, the government has abandoned due process in favor of media warfare, preemptive declarations of guilt and freezes on billions in critical federal funding.\n\n\nSo far, the campaign has been effective. To preserve hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants and contracts, Columbia and Brown have struck deals with the administration that cost them $220 million and $50 million, respectively, and go far beyond pledging tougher action to combat antisemitism. Columbia agreed to open academic programs and admissions decisions to outside monitoring. Brown pledged to ban transgender women from single-sex spaces and women’s sports. Harvard has sued the administration to try to unfreeze $2.6 billion in federal research funds, but it’s also trying to negotiate a settlement. Meanwhile, colleges nationwide are eliminating any remaining vestiges of diversity, equity and inclusion programs and shuttering multicultural centers lest the government come after them.\n\n\nThe portrait that emerged is dramatically at odds with Trump’s description of a “highly respected” and “incredibly successful” attorney. Peers in civil rights law said they always considered Terrell a minor player. Documents reveal a distinctly mixed legal track record, marred by malpractice suits, client disputes and mishandling a criminal case so badly that a federal appeals court lambasted his work as “woeful.”\n\n(And you were hoping for something beyond woeful.

Currently, 23 states and the District of Columbia have laws or policies that grant in-state tuition to undocumented students.\n\n\nVisa Delays Persist, Causing Some Students to Defer to Spring\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/08/27/international-students-face-visa-issues-fall\n\nThis week marked the start of the semester for hundreds of colleges across the U.S. But many international students, plagued by difficulty getting visa appointments and unusually high rates of visa denials, are still unsure if they’ll be able to attend college in the U.S. this year.\n\n\nAt the University of Maryland Baltimore County, a midsize public university that has a student body composed of about 15 percent international students, international Ph.D. and undergraduate students appear to be largely unaffected by visa issues. But the rate of visa issuance for master’s students is only about half what it has been in previous years, according to David Di Maria, UMBC’s vice provost for global engagement\n\n\nrump Deals A New Immigration Blow To International Students\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2025/08/28/trump-deals-a-new-immigration-blow-to-international-students/\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed a new rule to limit international students to fixed periods of entry, making enrolling at U.S. universities more precarious. Educators warn that if Trump officials finalize the rule, fewer international students will come to America. The regulation represents the most recent action by the Trump administration restricting international students and should be viewed in that context. Immigration data for July 2025 showed a significant decline in the arrival of international students compared to the same period a year earlier, including a drop of almost 50% for students from India. The proposed rule will increase bureaucracy and red tape for employers by including an unrelated measure to eliminate deference to prior findings of fact in adjudications.\n\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow have indicated they do not want international students to remain and work in the United States after completing their coursework. The proposed rule has a 30-day comment period. Barring litigation blocking the rule, it is expected to become final before the Fall 2026 academic year.\n\n\nThe four-year limit will likely be insufficient for many international students. The National Center for Education Statistics reports a median of 52 months (4.3 years) for completing a bachelor’s degree. The National Science Foundation reports a median of 5.7 years for completing a Ph.D.\n\n\nNYTimes: International Student Enrollments Stay Steady at Columbia and Princeton\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/29/us/international-students-race-affirmative-action-princeton-columbia.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut Black student enrollment is lower at the two universities after years of turmoil in elite higher education.\n\n\nColumbia’s Black and Hispanic enrollment was similar to last year, when the percentage of Black students saw significant declines in the wake of the court ruling. At Princeton, where Black enrollment had not previously seen much change, the university reported a notable drop in Black enrollment this year, even as the percentage of Hispanic admits remained stable.",

Basic questions about how these systems are designed, what data trains them, and whether they will deepen inequality or enable liberation remain largely unanswered. Much of the research that does exist comes from within the tech industry itself, conducted by employees who sign nondisclosure agreements and whose findings can be suppressed or ignored by corporate executives.\n\n\nIncomplete data access fundamentally undermines the breadth and depth of social media research. When researchers can only see what users clicked on, liked, or shared, they miss the vast majority of content that appeared in users’ feeds but went unnoticed. This creates a distorted picture, almost like trying to understand a movie by only watching the scenes that made audiences applaud. Without seeing the content landscape, researchers cannot accurately assess whether harmful content is being effectively moderated or simply ignored, how algorithmic recommendations are truly personalized or systematically biased, or how information flows through social networks.\n\n\nDOJ Deems Definition of HSIs Unconstitutional, Won’t Defend\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/institutions/minority-serving-institutions/2025/08/22/doj-deems-definition-hsis\n\nThe country’s roughly 600 Hispanic-serving institutions are in peril of losing hundreds of millions of dollars annually from the federal government, after the Department of Justice said it won’t defend the program against a lawsuit alleging the way HSIs are currently defined is unconstitutional. The suit challenges the requirement that a college or university’s undergraduate population must be at least a quarter Hispanic to receive HSI funding.\n\n(CUNY has several such institutions)\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon, a conservative outlet, first reported on the letter Friday. The DOJ subsequently provided Inside Higher Ed with the letter but gave no further comment or interviews.\n\n(The Free Beacon is always being given such scoops, hmm such diligent reporting)\n\n“There are proposals to the Department of Education right now that they said they were going to allocate,” Santiago [co-founder and chief executive officer of Excelencia in Education] said, noting that the program was set to dole out more than $350 million this fiscal year—money that institutions use for faculty development, facilities and other purposes.\n\n\n“The value of a program like this has really been investing in institutions that have a high concentration of low-income, first-generation students,” Santiago said.\n\n\nTrump’s Funding Freezes Against Universities in 5 Charts\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/2025/08/28/trumps-funding-freezes-against-universities-5-charts\n\n“All told, the tradeoff put to Harvard and other universities is clear: Allow the Government to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardize the institution’s ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions,” the university’s lawyers wrote in the initial complaint.\n\n\nAlthough only a few institutions have been affected, Fansmith said other college presidents should be concerned that they could face a similar penalty. Supporting a transgender student or having policies that the administration disagrees with could trigger a freeze, he added.\n\n\n“What [Trump officials] have shown is they will not follow the rules and the laws in a way that gives you some sense of what compliance actually looks like, because it’s irrelevant,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nOpinion | Trump Is Defunding Medical Research. It Could Cost You Your Life. - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/24/opinion/trump-defunding-medical-research.html\n\nDr. Kamila Naxerova is trying to understand how cancer spreads in the body. Dr. Rachael Sirianni is trying to find new ways to deliver drugs for childhood brain cancer. Dr. David Ho is trying to make breakthroughs in H.I.V. research.\n\n\nThese researchers and so many others worked to ensure that Americans had access to the best medical treatments available and that they had first access to those treatments. That is, they worked until Trump administration gutted funding to the National Institutes of Health and froze grants to universities across the country. You can put a dollar amount on how much has been saved, but the cost of what has been lost is incalculable.\n\n\nFormer NIH chief calls research cuts “careless” and “heartless” | AAMC\n\nhttps://www.aamc.org/news/former-nih-chief-calls-research-cuts-careless-and-heartless\n(Old story from June that popped across my screen)\n\nCollins retired in February 2025, issuing a statement that praised NIH-funded research and its staff as “individuals of extraordinary intellect and integrity, selfless and hard-working.” In a subsequent interview with “60 Minutes,” Collins called the environment at the NIH this year “untenable,” citing limits on scientific communication, firing of staff, and halts to new projects enforced by political directives.\n\n\nYes, it’s hard for people to understand the importance of basic science. I think the best way to deal with that is to talk about examples.\n\n\nI’ll reflect on my experience with cystic fibrosis research. The effort to try to do something for that almost-uniformly fatal disease started as a basic science enterprise to try to discover the nature of the gene that is misspelled. That was a hard slog back in the 1980s. Nobody would have supported [research into it] except NIH.\n\n\nNow, 30 years after the gene discovery, young people with cystic fibrosis are planning for retirement instead of an early funeral.\n\n\nSCOTUS Ruling Has “Bleak Implications” for Researchers\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/08/25/scotus-ruling-has-bleak-implications-researchers\n\nResearchers sued the NIH in April and got a win in June when a federal district court judge in Massachusetts ordered the agency to reinstate the grants immediately. Although the NIH has since reinstated many of those grants, Scott Delaney, an epidemiologist at Harvard University and former lawyer who’s been tracking grant cancellations, told Inside Higher Ed that after Thursday’s ruling those reinstated grants will “almost certainly” be re-terminated. If that happens, “I don’t think they’ll get their money back.”\n\n\n“Nobody has that kind of time. The nature of research is that you can’t just stop and restart it many months later,” said Delaney. “Folks have already had to do that once and many aren’t able to—they’ve had to lay off staff and lost contact with study participants. This additional delay probably renders the research unviable going forward.”\n\n\n“Make no mistake: This was a decision critical to the future of the nation, and the Supreme Court made the wrong choice,” the Association of American Medical Colleges said in a statement. “History will look upon these mass NIH research grant terminations with shame. The Court has turned a blind eye to this grievous attack on science and medicine, and we call upon Congress to take action to restore the rule of law at NIH.”\n\n\nHe added that Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s dissent sums up his interpretation of the ruling’s implications. “This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist,” Jackson wrote. “Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: That one, and this Administration always wins.”\n\n\nNIH Publisher Fee Cap Plan ‘Not Comprehensive Enough,’ Critics Say\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/08/27/nih-publisher-fee-cap-plan-not-comprehensive\n\nThe agency, which is the nation’s largest funder of biomedical research, wants to do that by capping—or potentially disallowing—the amount of money it gives to NIH-funded researchers who want to make their work publicly accessible by paying publishers article processing charges. A July 30 request for information memo outlined five potential options, which the NIH says are all aimed at balancing the “feasibility of providing research results with maximizing the use of taxpayer funds to support research.”\n\n\nJay Bhattacharya, director of the NIH, has said the policy could be a mechanism for ending what he sees as the “perverse incentives” driving the $19 billion for-profit academic publishing industry and making it “much harder for a small number of scientific elite to say what’s true and false.”\n\n\n\n\n\nHHS Ends Minority Biomedical Research Support Program\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/27/hhs-ends-minority-biomedical-research-support-program\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department has terminated the Minority Biomedical Research Support program, which provided colleges and universities grants to increase the number of minority faculty, students and investigators conducting biomedical research.\n\n\nSTAT reported the move earlier. Rochelle Newman, a University of Maryland psychologist who used the grant to pay undergraduate researchers and train them, told STAT that “cutting of these programs means that an entire generation of students will end up being lost to science.”\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Grants for Area Studies and Foreign Language at Risk\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/08/25/federal-grants-area-studies-and-foreign-language-risk\n\nFor 67 years, the Department of Education has administered grants to universities to create centers devoted to foreign languages and area studies, a field focused on the study of the culture of a particular area or region. Now, those centers are under fire by the Trump administration, which has not released the funding the grantees expected to receive in July.\n\n\nThe grants support what are known as National Resource Centers, which were originally developed as a national security tool to help the U.S. increase its international expertise in the midst of the Cold War and the aftermath of Soviet Union’s 1957 launch of Sputnik. Since then, their purpose has shifted with the times, now focusing not only on producing scholars but also on community outreach and collaboration with K–12 schools.\n\n\nThe funding cuts appear to be caused by the Office of Management and Budget; records show that the agency has not approved appropriations for programs formerly housed in IFLE, including the NRC program, as well as the Foreign Language and Area Studies fellowships, which fund scholarships and stipends for undergraduate and graduate students studying these disciplines. In total, about $85 million was appropriated for IFLE programs for FY 2025–26, including $60 million for NRCs and FLAS.\n\n\nDems Claim ED Is Making It Harder for Students to File Financial Aid Complaints\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/26/its-more-difficult-file-student-aid-complaints-dems-say\n\n“ED is covering up its attempts to make [the Office of Federal Student Aid] less responsive to millions of students, families, and borrowers who rely on the agency to lower the cost of attending college and protect them from loan servicer misconduct,” the senators wrote. “We urge you to immediately act on our findings by streamlining the ‘Submit a Complaint’ process and restoring FSA’s workforce so borrowers can get the help they need.”\n\n\nIn the letter, Warren states that she told FSA in March that the button for submitting online complaints had been “hidden.” The department responded in April that the button had just been moved from the top of the webpage to the footer and relabeled as “submit feedback.” The department added that no employees who handle technical functions of the aid applications of loan servicing had been laid off, and while some employees that handle complaints were, the remaining employees will “still be responding” to future complaints.\n\n\nBut the Democrats say they tested those claims and found the department’s reassurances were misleading. Although the department did move and rename the complaint button, it also added a series of four extra navigation clicks that must be made before the user actually reaches the webpage where they can file a complaint. (Inside Higher Ed checked the website and verified these steps. You can see screenshots of the process below.)\n\n\nAgencies Share New Guidance on Foreign Threats at U.S. Colleges\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/27/agencies-share-guidance-foreign-threats-us-colleges\n\nWarning American colleges and universities about increasing foreign threats to research, a group of federal intelligence agencies and the Education Department released new guidance this week outlining how the institutions can better protect themselves.\n\n\nFor example, the 40-page “Safeguarding Academia” bulletin in part encourages colleges and researchers to be transparent about who else is involved in a research project, noting that failing to disclose foreign collaborations could lead to sanctions. The agencies urged researchers to do their due diligence on any potential collaborators and outlined other cybersecurity best practices.",

Soon after, the U.S. Education Department announced it would require universities to report new data on applicants, broken down by race, to “ensure race-based preferences are not used.”\n\n\n“There’s an effort to say that the law is something that it’s not. There’s an effort to say that it’s illegal to seek to have a diverse student body,” said Peter McDonough, general counsel for the American Council on Education, a university lobbying group.\n\n\n“Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life,” Roberts added. However, “universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today.”\n\n\nThe University of California system has been complying with California’s ban on affirmative action for decades, said spokesman Omar Rodriguez. “At the same time, we remain committed to expanding access for all qualified students,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch out for middle states\n\n(Thanks BE)\n\nTrouble at Columbia (non-compliance warning on Standard 2); trouble at KBCC (required to submit extensive suplemental material on budget); 3) trouble at Matropolitan College (non-compliance show cause based on not meeting Standard 4—Planning, resources, and Institutional improvement\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Harvard, Trump administration cuts hit young scientists hard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/08/24/harvard-grad-students-research-cuts/\n\nThe cuts and uncertainty could disrupt the science pipeline and threaten experiments targeting cancer, autism, quantum physics, military robotics and hundreds of other realms, including Scully’s work in systems biology. At Harvard, more than 700 graduate students and nearly 800 postdoctoral researchers get their salaries, stipends or tuition support from federally funded research, according to court documents. Early-career researchers such as Scully are most at risk.\n\n\nPeople are panicking, said Henri Garrison-Desany, who was a research fellow in public health at Harvard but amid hiring and funding freezes spent this summer teaching yoga. “I’m just really sad about how much it is turning research back decades in the span of months,” he said, “and really derailing people’s careers.”\n\n\nThe government had been a trusted partner, said Elisabeth Stelson, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard’s school of public health, but it now seems to be harming the things scientists care about most.\n\n\nPeople are watching years of their life’s work evaporate so quickly, she said. “We feel like the lost generation.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Is Making Changes Trump Officials Want, Even Without a Deal\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/23/us/harvard-changes-academic-freedom-trump-deal.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut it has also taken a host of steps that align with the White House’s desires, checking off items on the administration’s detailed menu, which have ranged from eliminating diversity offices to ousting program leaders. In some cases, students and faculty members worry, the new, Trump-inspired policies may interfere with the freedom of expression that is central to the university’s mission.\n\n\nPresident Trump and his appointees have made their attack on Harvard a totem for the changes they want to see across America’s elite universities, using the government’s blunt power to force compliance in a manner never before seen. Universities across the country are watching closely, to see what Harvard might do and what it might be willing to sacrifice, as they seek a way forward for their own campuses.\n\n\nThe Trump administration’s demands included eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs. In April, Harvard renamed its Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, which is now called the Office for Community and Campus Life. More recently, Harvard also took down websites for its Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, as well as websites for companion offices for gay and female students, and said they were merging them into a new, single center.\n\n\nThe government has also sought leadership shake-ups in certain departments, including the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, after Jewish alumni and others accused the programs of sponsoring antisemitic programming. Harvard removed two of the center’s leaders, including Cemal Kafadar, a leading Turkish scholar, in March.\n\n\nAnd Trump officials asked for an end to Harvard’s partnership with Birzeit University, a top Palestinian college in the West Bank. Harvard said it had suspended the relationship and had struck up new ones with institutions in Israel.\n\n\nThe A.A.U.P. is, for now, pressing forward with its own lawsuit against the Trump administration, even as Harvard would be likely to resolve, as part of any deal with the White House, the two federal court cases it filed. One seeks the restoration of $2.2 billion in funding that has been frozen or withdrawn by the federal government. Another opposes the Trump administration’s efforts to block international students.\n\n\nWill the Supreme Court’s Ruling on Research Grants Sink Harvard’s Lawsuit Against Trump?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/will-the-supreme-courts-ruling-on-research-grants-sink-harvards-lawsuit-against-trump\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Got Most of Its Research Funding Back. The Damage Goes Deeper.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/nyregion/columbia-trump-federal-money-returned.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nWhile hundreds of millions of dollars in frozen federal research funding has been restored, a smaller subset of grants in areas that are out of favor with the White House, including transgender health, have not. Columbia’s School of Public Health and medical center remain in austerity mode, with fewer slots for Ph.D. students and hiring delays caused by the original suspension of funding.\n\n\nAnd looming over the deal, researchers said, is a bleak national outlook for federal science funding, making some scientists feel as if they dodged a bullet only to face the possibility of a firing squad.\n\n\nAn Aug. 7 executive order signed by President Trump, for example, requires additional review of federal scientific grant awards to ensure that they are “consistent with agency priorities and the national interest.” The White House has also proposed a 40 percent cut to the budget of the National Institutes of Health, the main source of medical research funding from the federal government, although a Senate committee has resisted the steep reduction.\n\n\nStill, the overall funding picture means that some damage cannot be contained. As Washington debates the cuts to science funding, Columbia and other research universities have instituted hiring freezes, cut expenses and reduced the number of students they will educate.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Law Firm Pressures Brown University to Erase Research on Anti-Wind Groups\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/climate/brown-university-offshore-wind-marzulla.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nA law firm representing opponents of offshore wind farms is demanding that Brown University retract research that details links between the fossil fuel industry and anti-wind groups.\n\n\nThe demands come at a precarious time for the nation’s universities, which have become targets of a pressure campaign conducted by the Trump administration. Last month, Brown struck a deal with the government to restore lost federal research funding and end investigations into alleged discrimination.\n\n\nThe Trump administration is trying to stop the country’s nascent wind industry, a source of energy that President Trump has disparaged since he failed to stop an offshore wind farm from being built within view of one of his Scottish golf courses.\n\n\nMarzulla Law L.L.C. is representing several groups that are fighting offshore wind, including Green Oceans, a nonprofit organization that is trying to overturn federal permits for Revolution Wind, a 65-turbine wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island.\n\n\nIn an Aug. 11 letter to Brown’s general counsel, Mr. Marzulla objected to research published by the Climate and Development Lab at Brown that found that Green Oceans had spread misinformation about climate change and operated as part of “a fossil-fuel-funded disinformation network.”\n\n\nJ. Timmons Roberts, who leads the Climate and Development Lab, said in an interview that his students had found that groups fighting offshore wind “have chosen to get in bed with some of the most anti-environment and anti-climate actors.” He called the letter “strategic harassment to shut me up and waste my time and make me more cautious.”\n\n\n\n\n\nEd Dept. Says George Mason Violated Civil Rights Law\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/22/ed-dept-says-george-mason-violated-civil-rights-law\n(Say Uncle)\n\nGregory Washington, president of Virginia’s George Mason University, must apologize to the university community for “promoting unlawful discriminatory practices” in order to resolve allegations that the institution violated civil rights law, the Department of Education announced Friday.\n\n\nActing Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said the unlawful practices began shortly after the murder of George Floyd, when Washington called on faculty and administrators to expunge campus of “racist vestiges” by “intentionally discriminat[ing] on the basis of race.”\n\n\nIn addition to an apology, the Education Department is demanding that GMU post that statement “prominently” to the university’s website, remove any contrary statements from the past and revise campus policies to prevent future race-based programming. It also wants the institution to begin an annual training session for all individuals involved in recruitment, hiring, promotion or tenure decisions to emphasize the ban on racial consideration and provide records documenting compliance whenever they are requested moving forward.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/education-dept-finds-faculty-diversity-efforts-at-george-mason-u-were-discriminatory\n\nGeorge Mason Must Not Comply With the Government’s Demands (opinion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/08/25/george-mason-must-not-comply-governments-demands-opinion\n\nThe message to George Mason, where I was a professor of public policy for nearly two decades, is clear: Equity is now presented as a civil rights violation.\n\n\nTitle VI was meant to prevent discrimination, not to penalize institutions for recognizing that diversity matters. With courts allowing the consideration of diversity as one factor among many in holistic decisions, OCR’s stance appears to be a politically motivated shift away from long-standing interpretations—not a clear enforcement of the law. Just last week, a federal judge “struck down two Trump administration actions aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the nation’s schools and universities,” the Associated Press reported.\n\n\nMost alarming in OCR’s proposed resolutions is the demand for a personal apology from the university’s first Black president. Washington, who called for eliminating racist legacies on campus, is now being compelled to apologize for doing just that. This isn’t simply an institutional issue—it’s a deeply symbolic act that resembles public shaming of a leader of color for advocating inclusion. It evokes the disturbing history of targeting minority leaders through law and policy.\n\n\nHere again, ideology replaces impartial curation. A common thread emerges: Whether in higher education or national museums, diversity and sincere historical reflection are viewed not as civic strengths but as transgressions. Institutional autonomy and academic governance are being subordinated to partisan narratives.\n\n\nUniversities must remain havens of reasoned inquiry, honest history and inclusive excellence. When federal agencies start dictating not only policy but the exact language leaders must use, we enter coercive territory.\n\n\nThis moment is a clarion call for universities. Yesterday, it was the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard, dragged through headline-grabbing investigations. It was New College of Florida, where political appointees dismantled DEI programs and faculty governance. It was the University of Virginia, accused by the Department of Justice of defying federal antidiscrimination laws. Today it is Mason. Tomorrow, it could be UCLA, Michigan, Wisconsin or any other institution that values diversity, equity and academic freedom. No campus—public or private, flagship or regional—should assume it is immune.\n\n\nGeorge Mason should reject the department’s findings and oppose this injustice. Capitulation is not compliance; it’s surrender.\n\n\nGMU President Rejects OCR Findings\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/25/gmu-president-refuses-apologize-rejects-ocr-findings\n\nIn a letter to GMU’s board Monday, Washington’s attorney, Douglas F. Gansler, alleged that OCR cut its fact-finding efforts short and only interviewed two university deans before reaching the conclusions the Department of Education published Friday. Gansler wrote that “OCR’s letter contains gross mischaracterizations of statements made by Dr. Washington and outright omissions” related to the university’s DEI practices.\n\n\nGansler also accused OCR of selectively interpreting various remarks by Washington, the first Black president in GMU’s history.\n\n\n“To be clear, per OCR’s own findings, no job applicant has been discriminated against by GMU, nor has OCR attempted to name someone who has been discriminated against by GMU in any context. Therefore, it is a legal fiction for OCR to even assert or claim that there has been a Title VI or Title IX violation here,” Gansler wrote in a 10-page letter.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/gmu-president-refuses-to-apologize-for-diversity-efforts-calls-ed-dept-claims-absurd\n(and)\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/08/25/george-mason-president-refuses-apology-dei/\n\nVirginia Democrats reject more of Youngkin’s picks for college boards\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/08/28/schools-youngkin-virginia-george-mason/\n\nA panel of Virginia senators on Thursday rejected more of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s picks to serve on college boards, intensifying a showdown between the administration and lawmakers and plunging the state’s institutions of higher education into legal limbo.\n\n\nMembers of the state Senate’s Privileges and Elections committee voted 6 to 8 along party lines against 14 people who the Republican governor nominated to sit on governing boards at George Mason University, the University of Virginia and the Virginia Military Institute.\n\n\nDemocrats have now refused to seat a total of 22 people in two months on college boards based on concerns about their qualifications, backgrounds and intentions. The senators have said appointees that the committee rejects can no longer serve on the boards, an argument disputed by the state’s top Republicans.\n\n\nThe Thursday vote by Senate Democrats could have broad implications at George Mason in Northern Virginia, which is left with only six confirmed members on its 16-seat board. The bylaws for the governing board require eight members to constitute a quorum.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoward President Steps Down, Former President Appointed Interim\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/25/howard-president-steps-down-former-president-appointed-interim\n\nUniversity officials declined to comment about why Vinson is leaving only two years after he took up the helm\n\n\nBut the past year has also brought its share of challenges.

Membership is open to all CUNY faculty and staff who support its mission.\n\n\nCADHE aims to:\n\n\n\nEstablish a NY State MADC: Promote collaboration between CUNY and SUNY to defend against political attacks.\n\n\n\n*Counter misinformation: Share accurate narratives about CUNY’s role, history, and campus environments.\n\n\n*Engage with government: Work with city, regional, and state officials to strengthen public higher education.\n\n\n\nPromote public education: Advocate for its importance to New York’s economy, culture, and democracy.\n\n\n\n\nCollaborate nationally: Partner with unions, academic bodies, and student organizations defending higher education.\n\n\n\n\nAddress antisemitism misuse: Oppose its weaponization as a political tool to undermine universities.\n\n\n\n\nProtect academic freedom: Defend faculty and staff from delegitimization efforts, upholding free expression.\n\n\n\nIt’s Not a ‘Mutual-Defense Compact.’ But a New Ad From 18 Universities Aims to Send a Message.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/its-not-a-mutual-defense-compact-but-a-new-ad-from-18-universities-aims-to-send-a-message\n\nNow the 18 universities in the Big Ten, which represent both an athletic conference and an academic alliance, have collaborated on an advertisement defending higher ed that will air during college football games. The 30-second spot blends a healthy dose of agrarian charm and shots of high-tech laboratories, highlighting the universities’ contributions to research, health care, and their communities.\n\n\nIn the same week that the new ad was announced, the chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign acknowledged that reality in an interview with Illinois Public Media. “I am assuming that we will eventually find ourselves a target, as is everyone in higher ed,” said Charles L. Isbell Jr.\n\n\nThough the joint ad has been in the works for a while, Martin said he — along with representatives from Ohio State University, Illinois, and the Association of American Universities — formally pitched the idea during a May meeting of the Big Ten’s presidents and chancellors. Martin and several colleagues worked on the ad through the Big Ten Academic Alliance, a collaboration unit that’s funded by each member university’s provost.\n\n\n“The chancellors and presidents were so supportive that they asked for two more spots,” Martin said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWebinar to share details about the services offered and provide legal updates and resources for he CUNY Immigration Assistance Program\n\nhttps://ybephbsyus.formstack.com/forms/cuny_immigration_assistance_program_september2025_webinar\n(Thanks JC for sending out on the listserv)\n(Also)\nhttps://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/communications-marketing/immigrationresourcesandinformation/cuny-immigration-assistance-project-ciap/\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Wants to Drown Us in a Sea of Chaos\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/02/opinion/trump-winning-imperial-presidency.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUniversities retreat under pressure, law firms submit to extortion, scientific and medical research funding has been decimated, federal employees face ideological purges, tariffs are imposed as political weapons, the military has become a domestic police force and the administration is demanding that cultural institutions mute or even eliminate criticism of the worst aspects of America’s past.\n\n\nIt is an asymmetric struggle without precedent in American political history, creating a predicament for all those opposed to a president who acts without regard to law, constitutional limits or congressional authorization, who disdains due process, prosecutes political adversaries and weaponizes regulatory agencies to attack the media, academia, the legal profession and liberal democracy itself.\n\n\nWhile Trump thrives on the wreckage he leaves in his wake, he is guided by Russell Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, and Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser. Vought and Miller are coldblooded, ideologically driven strategists who have spent nearly a decade developing the foundations for this MAGA takeover of what was once a familiar American way of life.\n\n\nI wrote to Bob Bauer, a professor of practice at N.Y.U. law school and a Democratic expert in the structuring and financing of political organizations, asking for his views on the strategic options available to opponents of the MAGA agenda.\n\n\nHe replied by email, arguing that “there is an urgent opposition to be mounted and effectively articulated.”\n\n\nMittelstadt [historian of 20th-century America at Rutgers] said she spoke at the Aug. 14-15 conference on Liberalism for the 21st Century sponsored by the Institute for the Study of Modern Authoritarianism, where many participants supported a strategy of “Never Trumpers, liberals, libertarians all agreeing on a lowest common denominator of a rules-based order of some kind and fighting on that basis. While most on the center or left would, of course, endorse a rules-based order, I’m not certain it will capture the imagination of people who can’t pay for college or find a place to live affordably.”\n\n\nThe Battle for “Viewpoint Diversity”\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/curriculum/2025/09/02/battle-viewpoint-diversity\n\nNow the White House is fueling their push, demanding viewpoint diversity under threat of huge funding cuts. Some say universities need to reform themselves to regain public and governmental support.\n\n\nTo take one example of conservatives forcing change, Indiana Republicans last year passed Senate Enrolled Act 202, which threatens the jobs of even tenured faculty at public universities who don’t foster intellectual diversity.\n\n\nThe Trump administration has also wielded intellectual diversity as a weapon in its demands of some of the nation’s wealthiest universities. In a letter to Harvard in April, government officials said that in order to get its federal research funding restored, the university must, among other things, employ a federally approved external party to “audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint diversity.” It didn’t define the term.\n\n\nState legislators tasked West Virginia University’s new Washington Center for Civics, Culture and Statesmanship with expanding “intellectual diversity,” offering “programming related to the values of open inquiry and civil discourse” and enriching the curriculum with the “great debates of western civilization.” Iowa’s Legislature created a “center for intellectual freedom” at the University of Iowa, ordering it to offer “civil discourse” programming and expand “intellectual diversity.” Similarly, Utah’s Legislature created a civic center at Utah State University committed to “viewpoint diversity and civil discourse” and mandated that all general ed courses be taught by faculty appointed to that center by its director.\n\n\n“Intellectual diversity works one way, and it always works in the way of conservative thought,” said Isaac Kamola, director of the American Association of University Professors’ Center for the Defense of Academic Freedom and an associate political science professor at Trinity College in Connecticut. Those who say they favor intellectual diversity never say, “We need Marx in the business school,” he added.\n\n\nDespots at Home and Abroad Want to Silence Our Campuses\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/despots-at-home-and-abroad-want-to-silence-our-campuses\n\nIt’s a dangerous time to be an international student in the United States. Writing an op-ed in a student newspaper. Joining a campus protest. Even just posting on social media. Legal and protected speech now puts international students at risk of deportation if the Trump administration doesn’t like what they have to say.\n\n\nForeign students studying in the United States with the dream of walking at commencement now instead risk the nightmare of being dragged by masked agents into an unmarked van, all because they engaged in the same speech their citizen classmates are free to voice without punishment or consequence.\n\n\n\n\nIn Trump’s Federal Work Force Cuts, Black Women Are Among the Hardest Hit - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/31/us/politics/trump-federal-work-force-black-women.html\n\nWhile tens of thousands of employees have lost their jobs in Mr. Trump’s slash-and-burn approach to shrinking the federal work force, experts say the cuts disproportionately affect Black employees — and Black women in particular. Black women make up 12 percent of the federal work force, nearly double their share of the labor force overall.\n\n\nThe most recent labor statistics show that nationwide, Black women lost 319,000 jobs in the public and private sectors between February and July of this year, the only major female demographic to experience significant job losses during this five-month period, according to an analysis by Katica Roy, a gender economist.\n\n\nSenator Who Banned DEI Set to Be Texas Tech Chancellor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/09/03/senator-who-banned-dei-set-be-texas-tech-chancellor\n\nFollowing pro-Palestinian protests and a police crackdown on an encampment at the University of Texas at Austin in 2024, the Texas Legislature this year passed another law restricting free speech on public campuses, including banning all expressive activities from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m.\n\n\nThe Legislature also this year passed a wide-ranging bill that allows public college and university presidents to take over faculty senates and councils, prohibits faculty elected to those bodies from serving more than two years in a row, and creates an “ombudsman” position that can threaten universities’ funding if they don’t follow that law or the DEI ban.\n\n\nThe lead author listed on all three laws is Sen. Brandon Creighton, chair of the Texas Senate education committee. Having overhauled higher ed statewide, he’s about to get the chance to further his vision at one large university system: On Thursday, the Texas Tech University System named Creighton the system chancellor and chief executive officer job.\n\n\nClemson Ends Several Faculty and Staff Affinity Commissions\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/04/clemson-ends-several-faculty-and-staff-affinity-commissions\n\nThe now-sunsetted groups included the Accessibility Commission, the Asian Pacific Islander DESI American Commission, the Commission on the Black Experience, the Commission on Latino Affairs, the LGBTQ Commission, the Veterans Commission and the Commission on Women, according to the Internet Archive.\n\n\nThe right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation, in a report released Tuesday, listed the Clemson commissions as an example of ways that universities and K–12 schools are continuing “DEI activities” following Trump’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs, officers and personnel.\n\n\nNYTimes: College Board Cancels Tool for Finding Low-Income High Achievers\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/04/us/college-board-diversity-landscape.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nWhen the Supreme Court banned affirmative action in college admissions in 2023, many universities began looking more closely at socioeconomic status to admit more diverse classes without considering race.\n\n\nScores of schools turned to a tool created by the College Board, which administers the SAT exam, to identify promising high school students from disadvantaged neighborhoods and schools.\n\n\nThis week, the College Board quietly notified schools that it was eliminating the tool, called Landscape. The board provided little explanation for its decision.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/opinion/math-dei.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nNYTimes: What I Got Wrong About D.E.I—As my career has advanced, what I’ve learned is that D.E.I. initiatives helped others see value in my abilities and experience that would have been missed otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Targets Financial Relief for Undocumented Students\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/04/us/politics/trump-tuition-undocumented-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAlthough her tuition previously cost about $5,000 a semester and was covered entirely by state [Texas] financial aid, Berenice said her tuition costs jumped to $21,000 this semester.\n\n\nThe challenge against Texas was one of several efforts by the Trump administration to clamp down on programs that provide financial relief for undocumented students. After the Justice Department filed a complaint against Texas, it challenged similar policies in Kentucky, Minnesota and Oklahoma. On Tuesday, the department also filed a complaint against Illinois for offering in-state tuition and scholarships to unauthorized immigrants.\n\n\nDOJ Sues Illinois Over In-State Tuition for Noncitizens\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/04/doj-sues-illinois-over-state-tuition-noncitizens\n\nThe DOJ filed a complaint in the Southern District of Illinois against the state, Gov. JB Pritzker, the state attorney general and boards of trustees of state universities. The complaint argues that it’s illegal to offer lower tuition rates to undocumented students if out-of-state citizens can’t also benefit.\n\n\nIllinois passed a law in 2003 that grants in-state tuition to undocumented students who meet certain criteria. To qualify, students need to reside and attend high school in the state for three years, graduate from an Illinois high school, and sign an affidavit promising to apply to become a permanent resident as soon as possible. Pritzker then signed a bill into law last year that would loosen these criteria, starting in July 2026. Students will be able to pay in-state tuition rates if they meet one of two sets of requirements, including attending an Illinois high school for at least two years or a combination of high school and community college in the state for at least three years.\n\n\n\n\n\nRange of Reasons for Latest Job and Program Cuts\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/business/financial-health/2025/09/05/range-factors-spurred-campus-cutbacks-august\n\nFor some institutions, belt-tightening measures are directly tied to the economic forces battering the sector as a whole: declining enrollments, rising operating costs and broad economic uncertainty. For others, financial pressure from the Trump administration, which has frozen federal research funding at multiple institutions, prompted cuts. State lawmakers have also forced program reductions at some public institutions.\n\n\nMiddlebury College: The private liberal arts college in Vermont is shutting down the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, across the country in California, officials announced last week. Middlebury president Ian Baucom said the university is winding down graduate programs at the campus over a period of two years. Managing such graduate programs was “no longer feasible,” said Baucom, who added that the decision was made for financial reasons.\n\n\nUniversity of New Hampshire The layoffs are part of an effort to cut $17.5 million from UNH’s budget. University president Elizabeth Chilton also announced other cost-cutting efforts last month, including “scaling back professional development, student employment, building hours, dining hall hours, travel, printing, and other support services.”\n\n\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles One of the wealthiest institutions on this list, UCLA announced last month that it has temporarily paused faculty hiring and is making other belt-tightening moves. … The public university’s move comes at least partly in response to its standoff with the Trump administration, which froze hundreds of millions in research funding to the university last month as it pressured administrators over alleged antisemitism on campus. (Some funding has been restored by a court order.) The Trump administration has also demanded a $1 billion payout from the university, which California governor Gavin Newsom called “extortion.”\n\n\nUniversity of Kansas: The public university announced last month that it was implementing a temporary hiring freeze as administrators aim to reduce spending by $32 million, The Lawrence Journal-World reported. … “We are again navigating an uncertain fiscal environment because of external factors, such as disruptions to federal funding, changes in federal law, stagnant state funding, rising costs, changes in international enrollments, and a projected nationwide decline in college enrollment,” KU officials wrote in a message to campus.\n\n(And others)\n\n\n\nHHS Lawyer: NIH Shouldn’t Re-Terminate Grants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/02/hhs-lawyer-nih-shouldnt-re-terminate-grants\n\nThe National Institutes of Health shouldn’t cut off funding to 900 grants that the agency previously canceled and then had to restore thanks to a June court order, lawyers for the Department of Health and Human Services said last week.\n\n\n“For those grants reinstated by NIH in response to the June judgements, we would strongly recommend against re-terminating such grants, because it will likely be viewed as a reapplication of the now-vacated challenged directives,” wrote NIH legal adviser David Lankford.\n\n\nScience noted that political appointees at NIH could ignore the legal advice and re-terminate the grants. Additionally, the agency might have more latitude next fiscal year to cut off funding for grants that officials say don’t align with the administration’s priorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Trump is using civil rights laws to bring schools to heel : NPR\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5500262/trump-civil-rights-schools-students\n\nThe country’s federal civil rights laws, written to protect marginalized groups from discrimination, have become an unlikely tool in the Trump administration’s efforts to end targeted support for students of color and protections for transgender students.\n\n\n“This interpretation [of the law] doesn’t bear any relationship to the actual charge of Title IX,” says Catherine Lhamon, who oversaw OCR during both the Obama and Biden administrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to Know About House Republicans’ Education Budget\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/09/04/what-know-about-house-republicans-education-budget\n\nReleased Tuesday, the House’s spending plan would cut the Department of Education’s budget by 15 percent. That gives the agency $67 billion, down from $79 billion in fiscal year 2025. Funding for key student aid programs like the Pell Grant and the TRIO college-access initiative would remain stable, but others could face steep cuts or be zeroed out entirely.\n\n\nThe bill also includes a $456 million cut to the National Institutes of Health, a ban on enforcing certain Biden-era regulations and an attempt to rename the new workforce Pell Grant as the Trump Grant.\n\n(Ha Ha)\n\nStill, in many ways, House Republicans on the appropriations committee stuck with Trump. Certain grants focused on bolstering teacher preparation, aiding extremely low-income learners, providing childcare to student parents and promoting foreign language instruction would be zeroed out entirely. And other offices like the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights could lose millions.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: The Excruciating Question Confronting Black College Applicants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/01/opinion/college-essay-post-affirmative-action.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFor striving Black high school seniors, the generalized essay anxiety arrives in a particular, acute form: Should my personal statement address race? The Supreme Court decision two years ago eliminating affirmative action in college admissions fomented considerable uncertainty about the transformed admissions landscape, and the second Trump administration’s recent assaults on higher education have only exacerbated the confusion.\n\n\nPresident Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Education Secretary Linda McMahon have repeatedly brandished the court’s decision, seeking to prohibit universities from considering race in any way whatsoever, even though the opinion plainly requires no such thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow UNC Led a First-of-Its-Kind Plan to Shake Up College Accreditation\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-unc-led-a-first-of-its-kind-plan-to-shake-up-college-accreditation\n(Thanks BE for sharing)\n\nIn July 2024, the UNC system and the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, convened representatives from Florida, Georgia, Iowa, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia to talk about alternatives to the current model for accreditation, documents show. The UNC system then recommended in a September 2024 report that North Carolina “establish an accreditation agency formed by state university systems.” The report laid out steps that are now the game plan for the new multistate accreditor.\n\n\nThis spring, Dan Harrison, the UNC system’s vice president for academic affairs, sent a document to the system’s president describing himself and another UNC official, Andrew Kelly, as crucial to shaping how the accreditor would operate. “Currently, we enjoy some free ridership in that Florida is funding the effort, but the group relies on Kelly and Harrison for subject matter expertise,” the document stated. “There have not been major decision points where North Carolina’s preference has not been followed.”\n\n\nThe tension between DeSantis’s public posturing and North Carolina officials’ influential role behind the scenes underscores a crucial question for many faculty members and other skeptics: whether the new organization will be a non-ideological auditor focused on public universities’ particular needs, as UNC system leaders have pledged, or become a tool for conservatives to remake higher education.\n\n\nUnder the 1965 Higher Education Act, accreditors must evaluate 10 broadly defined areas in assessing an institution’s quality, such as student achievement, curriculum, faculty, finances, and compliance with federal laws. In the United States, most colleges belong to independent accreditors that used to oversee particular regions. While it is technically a voluntary process, federal financial aid is so crucial to most colleges that accreditation is in practice a requirement.\n\n\nOver the years, however, conservative lawmakers and think tanks have increasingly accused accreditors of stepping on institutions’ and states’ toes over governance issues. Critics also argue the bodies force colleges to adopt progressive ideologies. While some large accreditors have diversity, equity, and inclusion standards, the main accreditor for colleges in the South — the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, known as SACS — does not.\n\n\n… Kevin Kinser, an education-policy professor at Pennsylvania State University who studies accreditation, said the draft leaves many questions about how the standards will be evaluated. For example, if “viewpoint diversity” is a standard, he questioned how institutions would prove that they have faculty across the ideological spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Secures a Court Victory in Its Fight With Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/us/harvard-trump-funding-ruling.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Thanks ET and VC for sharing. Not this does not include Mike Schmidt as a co-author as the many articles leaking possibly false details about Harvard imminently settling)\n\nHarvard University won a crucial legal victory in its clash with the Trump administration on Wednesday, when a federal judge said that the government had broken the law by freezing billions of dollars in research funds in the name of stamping out antisemitism.\n\n\nAlthough the ruling was a milestone for Harvard, the only university to sue over the administration’s targeted assault on its research funding, President Trump had vowed to appeal any decision that went against him. His administration has spent months seeking to pressure Harvard in ways beyond research money, and while Judge Burroughs’s ruling may not put an end to that campaign, her opinion was a bracing rebuke.\n\n\nJudge Burroughs wrote on Wednesday that it was “difficult to conclude anything other than that defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/09/03/judge-rules-harvard-funding-freeze-illegal\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-ruling-trump-court-funding-8cc5026c?st=QwTyoE&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nPresident Trump said last month that he wants no less than $500 million from Harvard, telling Education Secretary Linda McMahon during a cabinet meeting: “They’ve been very bad. Don’t negotiate.”\n\n(Also Harvard President’s email to the community)\n\nA few hours ago, the US District Court granted Harvard’s motion for summary judgment, finding that the federal government’s freeze of University research funding was unlawful. The ruling affirms Harvard’s First Amendment and procedural rights, and validates our arguments in defense of the University’s academic freedom, critical scientific research, and the core principles of American higher education.\n\n\nOur principles will guide us on the path forward. We will continue to champion open inquiry and the free exchange of ideas, and to build a community in which all can thrive.

Membership is open to all CUNY faculty and staff who support its mission.\n\n\nCADHE aims to:\n\n\n\nEstablish a NY State MADC: Promote collaboration between CUNY and SUNY to defend against political attacks.\n\n\n\n*Counter misinformation: Share accurate narratives about CUNY’s role, history, and campus environments.\n\n\n*Engage with government: Work with city, regional, and state officials to strengthen public higher education.\n\n\n\nPromote public education: Advocate for its importance to New York’s economy, culture, and democracy.\n\n\n\n\nCollaborate nationally: Partner with unions, academic bodies, and student organizations defending higher education.\n\n\n\n\nAddress antisemitism misuse: Oppose its weaponization as a political tool to undermine universities.\n\n\n\n\nProtect academic freedom: Defend faculty and staff from delegitimization efforts, upholding free expression.\n\n\n\nIt’s Not a ‘Mutual-Defense Compact.’ But a New Ad From 18 Universities Aims to Send a Message.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/its-not-a-mutual-defense-compact-but-a-new-ad-from-18-universities-aims-to-send-a-message\n\nNow the 18 universities in the Big Ten, which represent both an athletic conference and an academic alliance, have collaborated on an advertisement defending higher ed that will air during college football games. The 30-second spot blends a healthy dose of agrarian charm and shots of high-tech laboratories, highlighting the universities’ contributions to research, health care, and their communities.\n\n\nIn the same week that the new ad was announced, the chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign acknowledged that reality in an interview with Illinois Public Media. “I am assuming that we will eventually find ourselves a target, as is everyone in higher ed,” said Charles L. Isbell Jr.\n\n\nThough the joint ad has been in the works for a while, Martin said he — along with representatives from Ohio State University, Illinois, and the Association of American Universities — formally pitched the idea during a May meeting of the Big Ten’s presidents and chancellors. Martin and several colleagues worked on the ad through the Big Ten Academic Alliance, a collaboration unit that’s funded by each member university’s provost.\n\n\n“The chancellors and presidents were so supportive that they asked for two more spots,” Martin said.",

Vought and Miller are coldblooded, ideologically driven strategists who have spent nearly a decade developing the foundations for this MAGA takeover of what was once a familiar American way of life.\n\n\nI wrote to Bob Bauer, a professor of practice at N.Y.U. law school and a Democratic expert in the structuring and financing of political organizations, asking for his views on the strategic options available to opponents of the MAGA agenda.\n\n\nHe replied by email, arguing that “there is an urgent opposition to be mounted and effectively articulated.”\n\n\nMittelstadt [historian of 20th-century America at Rutgers] said she spoke at the Aug. 14-15 conference on Liberalism for the 21st Century sponsored by the Institute for the Study of Modern Authoritarianism, where many participants supported a strategy of “Never Trumpers, liberals, libertarians all agreeing on a lowest common denominator of a rules-based order of some kind and fighting on that basis. While most on the center or left would, of course, endorse a rules-based order, I’m not certain it will capture the imagination of people who can’t pay for college or find a place to live affordably.”\n\n\nThe Battle for “Viewpoint Diversity”\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/curriculum/2025/09/02/battle-viewpoint-diversity\n\nNow the White House is fueling their push, demanding viewpoint diversity under threat of huge funding cuts. Some say universities need to reform themselves to regain public and governmental support.\n\n\nTo take one example of conservatives forcing change, Indiana Republicans last year passed Senate Enrolled Act 202, which threatens the jobs of even tenured faculty at public universities who don’t foster intellectual diversity.\n\n\nThe Trump administration has also wielded intellectual diversity as a weapon in its demands of some of the nation’s wealthiest universities. In a letter to Harvard in April, government officials said that in order to get its federal research funding restored, the university must, among other things, employ a federally approved external party to “audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint diversity.” It didn’t define the term.\n\n\nState legislators tasked West Virginia University’s new Washington Center for Civics, Culture and Statesmanship with expanding “intellectual diversity,” offering “programming related to the values of open inquiry and civil discourse” and enriching the curriculum with the “great debates of western civilization.” Iowa’s Legislature created a “center for intellectual freedom” at the University of Iowa, ordering it to offer “civil discourse” programming and expand “intellectual diversity.” Similarly, Utah’s Legislature created a civic center at Utah State University committed to “viewpoint diversity and civil discourse” and mandated that all general ed courses be taught by faculty appointed to that center by its director.\n\n\n“Intellectual diversity works one way, and it always works in the way of conservative thought,” said Isaac Kamola, director of the American Association of University Professors’ Center for the Defense of Academic Freedom and an associate political science professor at Trinity College in Connecticut. Those who say they favor intellectual diversity never say, “We need Marx in the business school,” he added.\n\n\nDespots at Home and Abroad Want to Silence Our Campuses\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/despots-at-home-and-abroad-want-to-silence-our-campuses\n\nIt’s a dangerous time to be an international student in the United States. Writing an op-ed in a student newspaper. Joining a campus protest. Even just posting on social media. Legal and protected speech now puts international students at risk of deportation if the Trump administration doesn’t like what they have to say.\n\n\nForeign students studying in the United States with the dream of walking at commencement now instead risk the nightmare of being dragged by masked agents into an unmarked van, all because they engaged in the same speech their citizen classmates are free to voice without punishment or consequence.\n\n\n\n\nIn Trump’s Federal Work Force Cuts, Black Women Are Among the Hardest Hit - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/31/us/politics/trump-federal-work-force-black-women.html\n\nWhile tens of thousands of employees have lost their jobs in Mr. Trump’s slash-and-burn approach to shrinking the federal work force, experts say the cuts disproportionately affect Black employees — and Black women in particular. Black women make up 12 percent of the federal work force, nearly double their share of the labor force overall.\n\n\nThe most recent labor statistics show that nationwide, Black women lost 319,000 jobs in the public and private sectors between February and July of this year, the only major female demographic to experience significant job losses during this five-month period, according to an analysis by Katica Roy, a gender economist.\n\n\nSenator Who Banned DEI Set to Be Texas Tech Chancellor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/09/03/senator-who-banned-dei-set-be-texas-tech-chancellor\n\nFollowing pro-Palestinian protests and a police crackdown on an encampment at the University of Texas at Austin in 2024, the Texas Legislature this year passed another law restricting free speech on public campuses, including banning all expressive activities from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m.\n\n\nThe Legislature also this year passed a wide-ranging bill that allows public college and university presidents to take over faculty senates and councils, prohibits faculty elected to those bodies from serving more than two years in a row, and creates an “ombudsman” position that can threaten universities’ funding if they don’t follow that law or the DEI ban.\n\n\nThe lead author listed on all three laws is Sen. Brandon Creighton, chair of the Texas Senate education committee. Having overhauled higher ed statewide, he’s about to get the chance to further his vision at one large university system: On Thursday, the Texas Tech University System named Creighton the system chancellor and chief executive officer job.\n\n\nClemson Ends Several Faculty and Staff Affinity Commissions\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/04/clemson-ends-several-faculty-and-staff-affinity-commissions\n\nThe now-sunsetted groups included the Accessibility Commission, the Asian Pacific Islander DESI American Commission, the Commission on the Black Experience, the Commission on Latino Affairs, the LGBTQ Commission, the Veterans Commission and the Commission on Women, according to the Internet Archive.\n\n\nThe right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation, in a report released Tuesday, listed the Clemson commissions as an example of ways that universities and K–12 schools are continuing “DEI activities” following Trump’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs, officers and personnel.\n\n\nNYTimes: College Board Cancels Tool for Finding Low-Income High Achievers\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/04/us/college-board-diversity-landscape.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nWhen the Supreme Court banned affirmative action in college admissions in 2023, many universities began looking more closely at socioeconomic status to admit more diverse classes without considering race.\n\n\nScores of schools turned to a tool created by the College Board, which administers the SAT exam, to identify promising high school students from disadvantaged neighborhoods and schools.\n\n\nThis week, the College Board quietly notified schools that it was eliminating the tool, called Landscape. The board provided little explanation for its decision.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/opinion/math-dei.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nNYTimes: What I Got Wrong About D.E.I—As my career has advanced, what I’ve learned is that D.E.I. initiatives helped others see value in my abilities and experience that would have been missed otherwise.",

After the Justice Department filed a complaint against Texas, it challenged similar policies in Kentucky, Minnesota and Oklahoma. On Tuesday, the department also filed a complaint against Illinois for offering in-state tuition and scholarships to unauthorized immigrants.\n\n\nDOJ Sues Illinois Over In-State Tuition for Noncitizens\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/04/doj-sues-illinois-over-state-tuition-noncitizens\n\nThe DOJ filed a complaint in the Southern District of Illinois against the state, Gov. JB Pritzker, the state attorney general and boards of trustees of state universities. The complaint argues that it’s illegal to offer lower tuition rates to undocumented students if out-of-state citizens can’t also benefit.\n\n\nIllinois passed a law in 2003 that grants in-state tuition to undocumented students who meet certain criteria. To qualify, students need to reside and attend high school in the state for three years, graduate from an Illinois high school, and sign an affidavit promising to apply to become a permanent resident as soon as possible. Pritzker then signed a bill into law last year that would loosen these criteria, starting in July 2026. Students will be able to pay in-state tuition rates if they meet one of two sets of requirements, including attending an Illinois high school for at least two years or a combination of high school and community college in the state for at least three years.",

For others, financial pressure from the Trump administration, which has frozen federal research funding at multiple institutions, prompted cuts. State lawmakers have also forced program reductions at some public institutions.\n\n\nMiddlebury College: The private liberal arts college in Vermont is shutting down the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, across the country in California, officials announced last week. Middlebury president Ian Baucom said the university is winding down graduate programs at the campus over a period of two years. Managing such graduate programs was “no longer feasible,” said Baucom, who added that the decision was made for financial reasons.\n\n\nUniversity of New Hampshire The layoffs are part of an effort to cut $17.5 million from UNH’s budget. University president Elizabeth Chilton also announced other cost-cutting efforts last month, including “scaling back professional development, student employment, building hours, dining hall hours, travel, printing, and other support services.”\n\n\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles One of the wealthiest institutions on this list, UCLA announced last month that it has temporarily paused faculty hiring and is making other belt-tightening moves. … The public university’s move comes at least partly in response to its standoff with the Trump administration, which froze hundreds of millions in research funding to the university last month as it pressured administrators over alleged antisemitism on campus. (Some funding has been restored by a court order.) The Trump administration has also demanded a $1 billion payout from the university, which California governor Gavin Newsom called “extortion.”\n\n\nUniversity of Kansas: The public university announced last month that it was implementing a temporary hiring freeze as administrators aim to reduce spending by $32 million, The Lawrence Journal-World reported. … “We are again navigating an uncertain fiscal environment because of external factors, such as disruptions to federal funding, changes in federal law, stagnant state funding, rising costs, changes in international enrollments, and a projected nationwide decline in college enrollment,” KU officials wrote in a message to campus.\n\n(And others)\n\n\n\nHHS Lawyer: NIH Shouldn’t Re-Terminate Grants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/02/hhs-lawyer-nih-shouldnt-re-terminate-grants\n\nThe National Institutes of Health shouldn’t cut off funding to 900 grants that the agency previously canceled and then had to restore thanks to a June court order, lawyers for the Department of Health and Human Services said last week.\n\n\n“For those grants reinstated by NIH in response to the June judgements, we would strongly recommend against re-terminating such grants, because it will likely be viewed as a reapplication of the now-vacated challenged directives,” wrote NIH legal adviser David Lankford.\n\n\nScience noted that political appointees at NIH could ignore the legal advice and re-terminate the grants. Additionally, the agency might have more latitude next fiscal year to cut off funding for grants that officials say don’t align with the administration’s priorities.",

That gives the agency $67 billion, down from $79 billion in fiscal year 2025. Funding for key student aid programs like the Pell Grant and the TRIO college-access initiative would remain stable, but others could face steep cuts or be zeroed out entirely.\n\n\nThe bill also includes a $456 million cut to the National Institutes of Health, a ban on enforcing certain Biden-era regulations and an attempt to rename the new workforce Pell Grant as the Trump Grant.\n\n(Ha Ha)\n\nStill, in many ways, House Republicans on the appropriations committee stuck with Trump. Certain grants focused on bolstering teacher preparation, aiding extremely low-income learners, providing childcare to student parents and promoting foreign language instruction would be zeroed out entirely.

The Supreme Court decision two years ago eliminating affirmative action in college admissions fomented considerable uncertainty about the transformed admissions landscape, and the second Trump administration’s recent assaults on higher education have only exacerbated the confusion.\n\n\nPresident Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Education Secretary Linda McMahon have repeatedly brandished the court’s decision, seeking to prohibit universities from considering race in any way whatsoever, even though the opinion plainly requires no such thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow UNC Led a First-of-Its-Kind Plan to Shake Up College Accreditation\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-unc-led-a-first-of-its-kind-plan-to-shake-up-college-accreditation\n(Thanks BE for sharing)\n\nIn July 2024, the UNC system and the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, convened representatives from Florida, Georgia, Iowa, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia to talk about alternatives to the current model for accreditation, documents show. The UNC system then recommended in a September 2024 report that North Carolina “establish an accreditation agency formed by state university systems.” The report laid out steps that are now the game plan for the new multistate accreditor.\n\n\nThis spring, Dan Harrison, the UNC system’s vice president for academic affairs, sent a document to the system’s president describing himself and another UNC official, Andrew Kelly, as crucial to shaping how the accreditor would operate. “Currently, we enjoy some free ridership in that Florida is funding the effort, but the group relies on Kelly and Harrison for subject matter expertise,” the document stated. “There have not been major decision points where North Carolina’s preference has not been followed.”\n\n\nThe tension between DeSantis’s public posturing and North Carolina officials’ influential role behind the scenes underscores a crucial question for many faculty members and other skeptics: whether the new organization will be a non-ideological auditor focused on public universities’ particular needs, as UNC system leaders have pledged, or become a tool for conservatives to remake higher education.\n\n\nUnder the 1965 Higher Education Act, accreditors must evaluate 10 broadly defined areas in assessing an institution’s quality, such as student achievement, curriculum, faculty, finances, and compliance with federal laws. In the United States, most colleges belong to independent accreditors that used to oversee particular regions. While it is technically a voluntary process, federal financial aid is so crucial to most colleges that accreditation is in practice a requirement.\n\n\nOver the years, however, conservative lawmakers and think tanks have increasingly accused accreditors of stepping on institutions’ and states’ toes over governance issues. Critics also argue the bodies force colleges to adopt progressive ideologies. While some large accreditors have diversity, equity, and inclusion standards, the main accreditor for colleges in the South — the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, known as SACS — does not.\n\n\n… Kevin Kinser, an education-policy professor at Pennsylvania State University who studies accreditation, said the draft leaves many questions about how the standards will be evaluated. For example, if “viewpoint diversity” is a standard, he questioned how institutions would prove that they have faculty across the ideological spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Secures a Court Victory in Its Fight With Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/us/harvard-trump-funding-ruling.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Thanks ET and VC for sharing.

His administration has spent months seeking to pressure Harvard in ways beyond research money, and while Judge Burroughs’s ruling may not put an end to that campaign, her opinion was a bracing rebuke.\n\n\nJudge Burroughs wrote on Wednesday that it was “difficult to conclude anything other than that defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/09/03/judge-rules-harvard-funding-freeze-illegal\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-ruling-trump-court-funding-8cc5026c?st=QwTyoE&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nPresident Trump said last month that he wants no less than $500 million from Harvard, telling Education Secretary Linda McMahon during a cabinet meeting: “They’ve been very bad.

The signatories below represent a wide range of STEM disciplines and institutions.

That idea has found quite wide use)\n\nNow the Heritage contingent was in Israel, in part, to discuss another contentious policy paper: Project Esther, the foundation’s proposal to rapidly dismantle the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States, along with its support at schools and universities, at progressive organizations and in Congress.\n\n\nDrafted in the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel in 2023 and the mounting protests against the war in Gaza, Project Esther outlined an ambitious plan to fight antisemitism by branding a broad range of critics of Israel as “effectively a terrorist support network,” so that they could be deported, defunded, sued, fired, expelled, ostracized and otherwise excluded from what it considered “open society.”\n\n\nProject Esther’s architects envisioned outcomes that at the time might have seemed far-fetched. Curriculum it believed to be sympathetic to a “Hamas support” narrative would be taken out of schools and universities, and “supporting faculty” would be removed. Social media would be purged of content deemed to be antisemitic. Institutions would lose public funding. Foreign students who pushed for Palestinian rights would have their visas revoked, or be deported.\n\n\nHeritage national security director who coauthored Project Esther, said it was “no coincidence that we called for a series of actions to take place privately and publicly, and they are now happening.”\n\n\nBut Project Esther aims to go further, equating actions such as participating in pro-Palestinian campus protests with providing “material support” for terrorism, a broad legal construct that can lead to prison time, deportations, civil penalties and other serious consequences.\n\n\n“Project Esther changed the paradigm by associating anyone who opposes Israeli policies with the ‘Hamas Support Network,’”\n\n\nSome evangelical Christians have increasingly aligned themselves with conservative political forces in Israel, supporting their claims of biblical dominion over contested Palestinian territories. Many feel a kinship with Israel because of shared religious heritage. But some also believe that supporting Israel will hasten biblical end times, or advance Christianity’s global influence.\n\n\nThe Visionary of Trump 2.0 - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/russell-vought-trump-doge/682821/\n(Russel Vought takes over for Elon Musk in efforts to kill this federal government. But he is more patient and will have a longer impact)\nOne example is “https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-quietly-kills-rule-to-shield-americans-from-data-brokers/\n\nTrump’s Attacks on International Students Are the Start of a Wider War | The New Republic\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/195142/trump-war-international-students-university\n\nIn recent months, foreign students—particularly those participating in pro-Palestine protests—have had their student visas threatened or have been detained and placed in deportation proceedings, signaling a sharp and politically charged shift in federal policy. At the same time, public and private research universities, which depend heavily on international students’ tuition and labor—especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines—are facing the erosion of a vital economic pillar. These developments threaten not only the foundational rights of free speech and academic freedom but also the financial stability of the institutions that anchor the U.S. higher education system and conduct the vital research on which the future will be built.\n\n\nFar from isolated incidents, these cases reflect an emerging strategy—leveraging immigration enforcement as a tool of political suppression. International students have become an ideal scapegoat: politically vulnerable, culturally diverse, and often outspoken. Immigration officials now claim broad authority to revoke visas for “supporting terrorism,” using vague, expansive definitions. The result is a chilling effect on campus expression and a stark warning to those who would protest U.S. policy.\n\n\nFor academic leaders like Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, the strategy is transparent. “They want to undermine higher education and also heighten the new Cold War on campus,” Wolfson said.\n\nIs the University Of Austin Betraying Its Founding Principles?\nhttps://quillette.com/2025/05/16/is-the-university-of-austin-betraying-its-founding-principles/\n\nSkilled immigration on the chopping block? Effects of eliminating “Optional Practical Training” in the US | PIIE\n\nhttps://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/skilled-immigration-chopping-block-effects-eliminating-optional\n\nThat may soon change. The US administration is under pressure to constrict or eliminate the largest single pipeline into lawful immigration for high-skilled, university-educated workers. This pipeline is called Optional Practical Training (OPT)—a temporary work permit given to some foreign graduates of US universities.\n\n\nOptional Practical Training is a federal program that allows most international students at US universities the choice to work in the United States for a limited period after they graduate. About 72 percent of foreign graduates use OPT. The permit generally lasts one year but extends to three years for graduates at any educational level in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is a work permit attached to the student visa, a bridge between university enrollment and the workforce, granted under regulations starting in 1947.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nThis [expecting a renaissance of rich controversies], of course, is politically naïve. As the historian of science Michael Hagner predicted in 2019, the commitment of right-wing populists to epistemic pluralism only lasts until they manage to establish their own views well enough to eliminate all other points of view. Consider book bans, grant cancellations, and the violation of the First Amendment rights of foreign students and faculty and you will find validated Hagner’s cynical perspective on the authoritarian promotion of viewpoint diversity.\n\n\nBoth Harding and Haidt put their fingers on a very real problem: Our collective thinking benefits from looking at any given issue from multiple angles. For all sorts of historical reasons, colleges often do not represent a spectrum that is broad enough.\n\n\nThis balancing act requires what Aristotle called phronesis, the capacity for good judgment, and it cannot be formalized through viewpoint-diversity audits and affirmative-action policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Comey questioning, the Trump administration again targets speech\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/17/trump-freedom-of-speech-critics/\n(Just 4 numbers is enough now…)\n\nCollege newspapers under pressure as immigration fears silence sources\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/17/college-newspapers-trump-international-students/\n\nFree speech is dead at the American university.

I think, from my vantage point, one of the greatest concerns is seeing students, and particularly international students, being, basically, taken away on what appears to be the basis of viewpoints and opinions that they might have shared, either in the form of protest or, in one case, an op-ed. That really flies in the face of exactly what the First Amendment is supposed to protect against, especially in a public institution, which is that it’s supposed to be a restraint on government.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Times Sq.

White of the Northern District of California, who was appointed to the court by President George W. Bush, granted a temporary injunction protecting international students who were among the thousands whose visas were revoked earlier this year without clear justification, writing that government officials had “uniformly wreaked havoc” and “likely exceeded their authority and acted arbitrarily and capriciously” by the mass revocation of students’ immigration status.\n\n\nJudge White’s ruling said that the order applied to all “similarly situated individuals” who participate in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which is the system governing student visas. In the order, he expressed suspicion that the Trump administration was trying to place future visa “terminations beyond judicial review.”\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Has Cut Science Funding to Its Lowest Level in Decades\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/22/upshot/nsf-grants-trump-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(With a great graphic.

In particular, we are concerned about the damaging proposed changes to student aid programs, including eligibility changes that will prevent many low-income students from accessing Pell Grants; the availability of federal student loans for graduate students; new and increased taxes imposed on our institutions of higher education; and significant cuts to other programs supporting millions of postsecondary students nationwide.\n\n\nNYTimes: Republicans Harness Tax Code to Punish Trump’s Political Nemeses\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/republicans-taxes-trump-opponents.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe legislation, which could change as it heads to the Senate, would raise taxes on universities like Harvard, as well as on immigrants and on companies based in countries with taxes that the Trump administration deems unfair.\n\n\n“If you’re an ideological friend of Trump, you’re in generally good shape,” said William Gale, a co-director of the Tax Policy Center, a think tank. “If you’re an ideological foe, you pay more.” The increases, he added, “feel very punitive.”\n\n\nWhile the tax [investment returns generated by their endowments] would represent a huge new cost for Harvard and other affected schools, it would raise less than $7 billion in government revenue over 10 years — a pittance compared with the trillions in tax cuts otherwise included in the bill.\n\n\n\n\nNSF terminates huge number of grants and stops awarding new ones\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01513-1\n(A podcast.

One exchange escalated when Pennsylvania Democratic representative Madeleine Dean, who was just appointed to the committee in January, repeatedly interrupted McMahon to ask why she “didn’t want to protect students” of color, with disabilities or from low-income families.\n\n\n“Why in God’s name do you want to shutter [the Education Department]?” she asked, exasperated. “Why are you in this job at all if you don’t have a dedication to the future of our children?

Brandon Jones, president of the American Geophysical Union: Scientific societies — professional organizations that represent researchers in specific fields — have a long history of stepping in when politics interferes with research. After the Trump administration suspended work in April on the U.S. government’s flagship report on the impacts of climate change, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society partnered with plans to publish some of the research so the public can still access the findings.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a mini N.I.H. Andrew Marks, professor of physiology at Columbia University: We need a new funding model for science research. I propose the creation of the American Research Collaborative, a kind of mini-National Institutes of Health that could provide funding for universities. The A.R.C. would be led by a governing board elected by member organizations like the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Universities could opt in, and the collaborative’s tax-exempt status would attract private donors. a\n\n\n\n\nBuild new alliances. Dr. Jane Lubchenco, co-founder of United by Nature: In January, over 100 scientists outside the federal government were struggling to come to grips with the administration’s cancellation of years of work on what would have been the first ever federal assessment of nature. We refused to quit. So we created a new path to deliver the report and show why the information matters. The initiative, called United by Nature, will have a governing body, advisers and partners, independent peer review and extensive public engagement.\n\n\n\nNYTimes: The President Will Destroy You Now\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/opinion/trump-musk-doge-government.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe war on academic research will have long-lasting implications for technical innovation in America. Scientists who cannot support their labs while President Trump holds their funds hostage for the sake of MAGA theater over the next four years will take their labs elsewhere.\n\n\nChina will be a winner in this. Uncertainty about government commitments will make it harder for investors to take basic and applied research in universities and move it to market. The longer the time horizon for investments, the more trust and stability matter. In the end, disrupters like Trump and Musk leave us with a much bigger legacy of doubt and uncertainty than achievement.\n\n\nMost Colleges Aren’t a Target of Trump (Yet). Here’s How Their Presidents Are Leading.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/most-colleges-arent-a-target-of-trump-yet-heres-how-their-presidents-are-leading\n\nStill, campus leaders at community colleges and four-year public regional and private institutions — representing the vast majority of higher ed — say they do see impacts of Trump’s policies. Fear, particularly about the future of financial aid and immigration crackdowns, is pervasive.\n\n\nBut the college [Delta] is also planning for contingencies. “If somehow the government is going to withhold federal financial-aid dollars going to students based on something,” Gavin said, “then that will be where we have to change.”\n\n\nDavid Tandberg, president of Adams State University, said he has tried to sort the administration’s actions into several buckets based on whether they would have a direct impact on his campus — a public regional institution in rural, southern Colorado — and whether they’re probably just rhetoric. “We’re seeing all of those, and it takes a lot to sort through them,” Tandberg said. “The first month it was coming like a fire hose.”\n\n\nSimilar to Delta College, an urgent concern for a university like Adams State is whether federal cuts could slow or stop the flow of student financial aid,\n\n\n\n\n\nAt universities from the Ivy League to state schools, a financial reckoning has started as President Trump’s funding cuts hit home\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/university-spending-cuts-layoffs-pay-budget-trump-9f261d14?st=ErRuU9&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nNYTimes: Republican Plan to Tax Elite Colleges Could Hit in Unexpected Places\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/universities-endowment-tax-republicans.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe goal of the proposal, laid out in a report last week from Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, is to hold accountable “woke, elite universities that operate more like major corporations.” McPherson [small school that accepts the vast majority of its applicants] could be on the list because it has an endowment of $1.6 billion, thanks to an anonymous donation a few years ago.\n\n(Don’t cry for McPherson, cry that this stealing from the rich to give to the richer is even being proposed.)\n\nChinese College Gives Harvard International Students ‘Unconditional Offers’ - Newsweek\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/harvard-hkust-china-college-international-students-offer-2076257\n\n\n\n\nHow I Lost Faith in My University’s Mission\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/05/19/how-i-lost-faith-my-universitys-mission-opinion\n(Look at all the interventions from outside that have happened at the University of Utah)\n\nthe State Legislature passed an anti-DEI bill, prohibiting, among other things, offices and programs related to diversity, equity or inclusion. Administrators were required to purge these three words from university websites and other documents, such as RPT—retention, promotion and tenure review—guidelines, and the university administration interpreted the law as requiring that the Women’s Resource Center, the Black Cultural Center and the LGBT Resource Center be shuttered.\n\n\nThe state has also imposed a “bathroom bill” requiring trans university students to use locker rooms aligning with their sex assigned at birth, has banned Pride flags in public spaces (and in faculty offices if they can be seen through a window), and now requires faculty to post their syllabi in a publicly searchable database. It also prohibits university presidents from taking a stand on any issue that does not bear upon the “mission, role or pedagogical objectives” of the institution. And finally, as the coup de grâce for academic freedom and faculty expertise, it has funded and established the Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that all students take general education courses on the topics of Western civilization and the rise of Christianity. The law establishing the center identifies it as a pilot program to be rolled out to other Utah universities in the future.\n\n\nRecently passed laws dictate the process by which all post-tenure reviews of faculty must be conducted, curtail shared governance and cut state funds to all Utah public institutions by 10 percent ($60.5 million). Universities can have the funds “reallocated” if they use them for high-demand, high-wage majors. As a result, we lost our History and Philosophy of Science major, which drew some of our best students, many of them double majoring in STEM subjects and working toward careers in medicine and public health.\n\n\n\n\n\nReviewing Course Evaluations: The Drinking Game - McSweeney’s Internet Tendency\n\nhttps://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/reviewing-course-evaluations-the-drinking-game\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

    "text": "NYTimes: The Group Behind Project 2025 Has a Plan to Crush the Pro-Palestinian Movement\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/us/project-esther-heritage-foundation-palestine.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(This article discusses the engineered backlash against protesters by the Heritage Foundation using federal funding as the cudgel. That idea has found quite wide use)\n\nNow the Heritage contingent was in Israel, in part, to discuss another contentious policy paper: Project Esther, the foundation’s proposal to rapidly dismantle the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States, along with its support at schools and universities, at progressive organizations and in Congress.\n\n\nDrafted in the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel in 2023 and the mounting protests against the war in Gaza, Project Esther outlined an ambitious plan to fight antisemitism by branding a broad range of critics of Israel as “effectively a terrorist support network,” so that they could be deported, defunded, sued, fired, expelled, ostracized and otherwise excluded from what it considered “open society.”\n\n\nProject Esther’s architects envisioned outcomes that at the time might have seemed far-fetched. Curriculum it believed to be sympathetic to a “Hamas support” narrative would be taken out of schools and universities, and “supporting faculty” would be removed. Social media would be purged of content deemed to be antisemitic. Institutions would lose public funding. Foreign students who pushed for Palestinian rights would have their visas revoked, or be deported.\n\n\nHeritage national security director who coauthored Project Esther, said it was “no coincidence that we called for a series of actions to take place privately and publicly, and they are now happening.”\n\n\nBut Project Esther aims to go further, equating actions such as participating in pro-Palestinian campus protests with providing “material support” for terrorism, a broad legal construct that can lead to prison time, deportations, civil penalties and other serious consequences.\n\n\n“Project Esther changed the paradigm by associating anyone who opposes Israeli policies with the ‘Hamas Support Network,’”\n\n\nSome evangelical Christians have increasingly aligned themselves with conservative political forces in Israel, supporting their claims of biblical dominion over contested Palestinian territories. Many feel a kinship with Israel because of shared religious heritage. But some also believe that supporting Israel will hasten biblical end times, or advance Christianity’s global influence.\n\n\nThe Visionary of Trump 2.0 - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/russell-vought-trump-doge/682821/\n(Russel Vought takes over for Elon Musk in efforts to kill this federal government. But he is more patient and will have a longer impact)\nOne example is “https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-quietly-kills-rule-to-shield-americans-from-data-brokers/\n\nTrump’s Attacks on International Students Are the Start of a Wider War | The New Republic\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/195142/trump-war-international-students-university\n\nIn recent months, foreign students—particularly those participating in pro-Palestine protests—have had their student visas threatened or have been detained and placed in deportation proceedings, signaling a sharp and politically charged shift in federal policy. At the same time, public and private research universities, which depend heavily on international students’ tuition and labor—especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines—are facing the erosion of a vital economic pillar. These developments threaten not only the foundational rights of free speech and academic freedom but also the financial stability of the institutions that anchor the U.S. higher education system and conduct the vital research on which the future will be built.\n\n\nFar from isolated incidents, these cases reflect an emerging strategy—leveraging immigration enforcement as a tool of political suppression. International students have become an ideal scapegoat: politically vulnerable, culturally diverse, and often outspoken. Immigration officials now claim broad authority to revoke visas for “supporting terrorism,” using vague, expansive definitions. The result is a chilling effect on campus expression and a stark warning to those who would protest U.S. policy.\n\n\nFor academic leaders like Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, the strategy is transparent. “They want to undermine higher education and also heighten the new Cold War on campus,” Wolfson said.\n\nIs the University Of Austin Betraying Its Founding Principles?\nhttps://quillette.com/2025/05/16/is-the-university-of-austin-betraying-its-founding-principles/\n\nSkilled immigration on the chopping block? Effects of eliminating “Optional Practical Training” in the US | PIIE\n\nhttps://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/skilled-immigration-chopping-block-effects-eliminating-optional\n\nThat may soon change. The US administration is under pressure to constrict or eliminate the largest single pipeline into lawful immigration for high-skilled, university-educated workers. This pipeline is called Optional Practical Training (OPT)—a temporary work permit given to some foreign graduates of US universities.\n\n\nOptional Practical Training is a federal program that allows most international students at US universities the choice to work in the United States for a limited period after they graduate. About 72 percent of foreign graduates use OPT. The permit generally lasts one year but extends to three years for graduates at any educational level in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is a work permit attached to the student visa, a bridge between university enrollment and the workforce, granted under regulations starting in 1947.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nThis [expecting a renaissance of rich controversies], of course, is politically naïve. As the historian of science Michael Hagner predicted in 2019, the commitment of right-wing populists to epistemic pluralism only lasts until they manage to establish their own views well enough to eliminate all other points of view. Consider book bans, grant cancellations, and the violation of the First Amendment rights of foreign students and faculty and you will find validated Hagner’s cynical perspective on the authoritarian promotion of viewpoint diversity.\n\n\nBoth Harding and Haidt put their fingers on a very real problem: Our collective thinking benefits from looking at any given issue from multiple angles. For all sorts of historical reasons, colleges often do not represent a spectrum that is broad enough.\n\n\nThis balancing act requires what Aristotle called phronesis, the capacity for good judgment, and it cannot be formalized through viewpoint-diversity audits and affirmative-action policies.",

In particular, we are concerned about the damaging proposed changes to student aid programs, including eligibility changes that will prevent many low-income students from accessing Pell Grants; the availability of federal student loans for graduate students; new and increased taxes imposed on our institutions of higher education; and significant cuts to other programs supporting millions of postsecondary students nationwide.\n\n\nNYTimes: Republicans Harness Tax Code to Punish Trump’s Political Nemeses\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/republicans-taxes-trump-opponents.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe legislation, which could change as it heads to the Senate, would raise taxes on universities like Harvard, as well as on immigrants and on companies based in countries with taxes that the Trump administration deems unfair.\n\n\n“If you’re an ideological friend of Trump, you’re in generally good shape,” said William Gale, a co-director of the Tax Policy Center, a think tank. “If you’re an ideological foe, you pay more.” The increases, he added, “feel very punitive.”\n\n\nWhile the tax [investment returns generated by their endowments] would represent a huge new cost for Harvard and other affected schools, it would raise less than $7 billion in government revenue over 10 years — a pittance compared with the trillions in tax cuts otherwise included in the bill.\n\n\n\n\nNSF terminates huge number of grants and stops awarding new ones\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01513-1\n(A podcast.

One exchange escalated when Pennsylvania Democratic representative Madeleine Dean, who was just appointed to the committee in January, repeatedly interrupted McMahon to ask why she “didn’t want to protect students” of color, with disabilities or from low-income families.\n\n\n“Why in God’s name do you want to shutter [the Education Department]?” she asked, exasperated. “Why are you in this job at all if you don’t have a dedication to the future of our children?

Brandon Jones, president of the American Geophysical Union: Scientific societies — professional organizations that represent researchers in specific fields — have a long history of stepping in when politics interferes with research. After the Trump administration suspended work in April on the U.S. government’s flagship report on the impacts of climate change, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society partnered with plans to publish some of the research so the public can still access the findings.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a mini N.I.H. Andrew Marks, professor of physiology at Columbia University: We need a new funding model for science research. I propose the creation of the American Research Collaborative, a kind of mini-National Institutes of Health that could provide funding for universities. The A.R.C. would be led by a governing board elected by member organizations like the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Universities could opt in, and the collaborative’s tax-exempt status would attract private donors. a\n\n\n\n\nBuild new alliances. Dr. Jane Lubchenco, co-founder of United by Nature: In January, over 100 scientists outside the federal government were struggling to come to grips with the administration’s cancellation of years of work on what would have been the first ever federal assessment of nature. We refused to quit. So we created a new path to deliver the report and show why the information matters. The initiative, called United by Nature, will have a governing body, advisers and partners, independent peer review and extensive public engagement.\n\n\n\nNYTimes: The President Will Destroy You Now\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/opinion/trump-musk-doge-government.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe war on academic research will have long-lasting implications for technical innovation in America. Scientists who cannot support their labs while President Trump holds their funds hostage for the sake of MAGA theater over the next four years will take their labs elsewhere.\n\n\nChina will be a winner in this. Uncertainty about government commitments will make it harder for investors to take basic and applied research in universities and move it to market. The longer the time horizon for investments, the more trust and stability matter. In the end, disrupters like Trump and Musk leave us with a much bigger legacy of doubt and uncertainty than achievement.\n\n\nMost Colleges Aren’t a Target of Trump (Yet). Here’s How Their Presidents Are Leading.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/most-colleges-arent-a-target-of-trump-yet-heres-how-their-presidents-are-leading\n\nStill, campus leaders at community colleges and four-year public regional and private institutions — representing the vast majority of higher ed — say they do see impacts of Trump’s policies. Fear, particularly about the future of financial aid and immigration crackdowns, is pervasive.\n\n\nBut the college [Delta] is also planning for contingencies. “If somehow the government is going to withhold federal financial-aid dollars going to students based on something,” Gavin said, “then that will be where we have to change.”\n\n\nDavid Tandberg, president of Adams State University, said he has tried to sort the administration’s actions into several buckets based on whether they would have a direct impact on his campus — a public regional institution in rural, southern Colorado — and whether they’re probably just rhetoric. “We’re seeing all of those, and it takes a lot to sort through them,” Tandberg said. “The first month it was coming like a fire hose.”\n\n\nSimilar to Delta College, an urgent concern for a university like Adams State is whether federal cuts could slow or stop the flow of student financial aid,",

Administrators were required to purge these three words from university websites and other documents, such as RPT—retention, promotion and tenure review—guidelines, and the university administration interpreted the law as requiring that the Women’s Resource Center, the Black Cultural Center and the LGBT Resource Center be shuttered.\n\n\nThe state has also imposed a “bathroom bill” requiring trans university students to use locker rooms aligning with their sex assigned at birth, has banned Pride flags in public spaces (and in faculty offices if they can be seen through a window), and now requires faculty to post their syllabi in a publicly searchable database. It also prohibits university presidents from taking a stand on any issue that does not bear upon the “mission, role or pedagogical objectives” of the institution. And finally, as the coup de grâce for academic freedom and faculty expertise, it has funded and established the Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that all students take general education courses on the topics of Western civilization and the rise of Christianity. The law establishing the center identifies it as a pilot program to be rolled out to other Utah universities in the future.\n\n\nRecently passed laws dictate the process by which all post-tenure reviews of faculty must be conducted, curtail shared governance and cut state funds to all Utah public institutions by 10 percent ($60.5 million). Universities can have the funds “reallocated” if they use them for high-demand, high-wage majors. As a result, we lost our History and Philosophy of Science major, which drew some of our best students, many of them double majoring in STEM subjects and working toward careers in medicine and public health.",

    "text": "Dear All,\nPlease find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.\nThanks to ES, VAC, JC, BE, KK, MP for helping out with the digest this week.\nAnd now the come for faculty senates …. (See George Mason)\n\n\n\nThe Review: Georgetown president says ‘we police’ the faculty. What?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/newsletter/the-review/2025-07-28\n(Thanks BE!!)\n\n“As in earlier rounds of hearings, the leaders tried hard to depict their institutions as eager to quash any sign of the putative scourge of anti-Jewish hatred on campus….[ Interim President of Georgetown Robert M. Groves said] that, since the October 7 attacks, Georgetown has ‘learned that we need to adapt to changing circumstances, almost continuously.’”\n\n\n“A congressional hearing is presumably one such circumstance; Groves had to adapt in real time to North Carolina Republican Virginia Foxx’s campaign against a Georgetown faculty member’s [ Jonathan A.C. Brown’s] right to extramural political speech. [ Brown is cited for his tweet saying, “I hope Iran does some symbolic strike on a [US military] base.”]\n\n\n“As far as academic freedom goes, this isn’t remotely an edge case. Brown’s speech is obviously protected. He is commenting both as a scholar of the region (one who is careful, indeed, to note the limits of his own expertise) and as a citizen about a major geopolitical event.”\n\n\n“Jonathan A.C. Brown is being investigated by Georgetown and condemned by Congress precisely for “speech in the public domain.” Given the susceptibility of campus discourse on the Middle East to Congressional censure, it is hard not to hear, in Groves’s blithe assurance that he and his fellow administrators ‘police’ their professors, something more intrusive than the rhetoric of academic rights and responsibilities.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAAUP Letter Supports CUNY Law Professor Ramzi Kassem\n\nhttps://www.aaup.org/news/aaup-letter-supports-cuny-law-professor-ramzi-kassem\n\nThese accusations are outrageous. Any discipline leveled against Professor Kassem for his representation of Mr. Khalil would violate AAUP standards on academic freedom and tenure and the terms of CUNY’s faculty labor contract. Even more critically, such discipline would contravene Professor Kassem’s constitutionally-protected speech and association. Federal courts have interpreted the First Amendment to protect the right of faculty to engage in an “independent and uninhibited exchange of ideas” as well as the right of the university to engage in “autonomous decisionmaking” free of legislative or, for that matter, judicial control.1 Courts have interpreted the First Amendment to prohibit efforts by the government to “usurp” the right of academic institutions to “determine [for themselves] who may teach” or “what may be taught.” Professor Kassem’s representation of Mr. Khalil as part of his clinical practice falls squarely within these protections.\n\n\nThe National AAUP stands in staunch support of Professor Ramzi Kassem’s academic and constitutional freedoms, and we will continue to closely watch CUNY’s defense of its faculty.\n\nhttps://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/2025-07/Letter-AAUP-CUNY-July-2025.pdf\n(The NYS AAUP has also written a letter regarding personnel decisions at Brooklyn College.)\n\n\n\n\non the Conservative Playbook (2023-2024)\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/us/universities-antisemitism-conservatives-liberals.html?searchResultPosition=13\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/us/harvard-president-campus-antisemitism-conservatives.html?searchResultPosition=14\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/20/us/dei-woke-claremont-institute.html?searchResultPosition=16\n(Thanks ES!)\n\nA Year of Challenges and Uncertainty, as Told Through Data\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-year-of-challenges-and-uncertainty-as-told-through-data\n(Many charts)\n\nMore Than Half of States Have Proposed Anti-DEI Legislation\n\n\nThe Pace of Bills Introduced and Passed Increased in 2025\n\n\nWhere Changes to DEI Efforts Took Place\n\n\nFederal Dollars Make Up 12% of Higher Ed’s Revenue\n\n\nFederal Funding Contributes Over $60 billion in R&D to Higher Ed\n\n\nColleges Are Clustered in High-Cost Areas\n\n\nRising Costs Have Led to Lower Take-Home Pay\n\n\nIn Application Growth, HBCUs Outpace Other Colleges\n\n\nColleges Have Not Returned to Requiring Tests\n\n\n\n\n\nKentucky Professor Calling for Global War to End Israel Removed From Teaching\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/07/28/ky-prof-calling-war-against-israel-pulled-teaching\n\nThe professor’s website urges nations to attack Israel to stop a genocide. His university president suggested he was “calling for the destruction of a people based on national origin.”\n\n\n“These activities may create a hostile environment for Jewish members of the university community or otherwise constitute harassment as defined by the Supreme Court,” Thro wrote. “The university has concerns that your actions may violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the equivalent state laws, and various university policies.”\n\n\nTitle VI prohibits discrimination based on shared ancestry, including antisemitism.\n\n\nBut the letter didn’t provide further details, such as what conference conduct or writings the university was concerned about, or how university officials became aware of this expression.\n\n\nNYTimes: Judge Bars Trump Administration From Punishing 2 Law Professors for I.C.C.

Reviews Syllabi to Ensure ‘Alternative Viewpoints’ Due to Anti-DEI Law\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-higher-eds-dismantling-of-dei\n\nWestern Kentucky University established a committee to review around 50 course syllabi “to confirm that alternative viewpoints are presented alongside dominant perspectives”; adopted a viewpoint-neutrality policy; and barred faculty and staff from attending diversity, equity and inclusion specific conferences or trainings.\n\n\nJustice Department Declares DEI Unlawful\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/2025/07/30/doj-declares-slew-dei-practices-unlawful-memo\n\nMore than three months after a federal court struck down an Education Department directive that barred any practices that consider race at colleges across the country, the Department of Justice declared Wednesday that diversity, equity and inclusion practices are unlawful and “discriminatory.”\n\n\nBut the agency’s memo goes even further than ED’s guidance, suggesting that programs that rely on what they describe as stand-ins for race, like recruitment efforts that focus on majority-minority geographic areas, could violate federal civil rights laws. The directive applies to any organization that receives federal funds, and DOJ officials warned that engaging in potentially unlawful practices could lead to a loss in grant funding.\n\n\nLynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, said that the memo is “another example of governmental overreach into academic freedom, institutional autonomy and shared governance that conditions federal funding on ideological alignment with the administration’s viewpoints.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Trump Upends Funding for Research, These Scholars Turn to GoFundMe\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/as-trump-upends-funding-for-research-these-scholars-turn-to-gofundme\n(Thanks BE!)\n\n“As the once-stable compact between universities and the federal government founders, some scholars are looking elsewhere for money.”\n\n\nFor example: The mother of Danielle DiFranco, a Ph.D. candidate in Joyce A. Schroeder breast-cancer research lab at the University of Arizona suggested starting a GoFundMe campaign because “family members would likely be willing to chip in to support her research, particularly since several relatives have had breast cancer.”\n\n\n“’It was odd to me, because I don’t really think of our research lab as a place that would need charity,’ DiFranco said, noting that campaigns on GoFundMe often benefit individuals or families facing medical crises, natural disasters, or other emergencies.”\n\n\n“It’s a long-running joke among academics waiting for news on their grant proposals: ‘If it’s not funded,’ they say, ‘we’ll just have a bake sale.’”\n\n\n“… crowdfunding in academe isn’t an entirely new notion. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2016 created an online FAQ page on best practices for crowdfunding research.”\n\n\n“Experiment, a science-specific fund-raising site, has been around since 2012 and has raised more than $12 million in support of 1,351 different projects. It’s an all-or-nothing funding platform, meaning that donors are only charged if the project reaches its fund-raising goal, and it also sends proceeds directly to the institutions its researchers are affiliated with.”\n\n\nBy cutting science, the Defense Department is eating its seed corn\n\n(Thanks MP!)\nhttps://www.defensenews.com/opinion/2025/07/24/by-cutting-science-the-defense-department-is-eating-its-seed-corn/\n\nWe are in a long-term strategic competition with China that has diplomatic, economic, and military components. To be effective, diplomacy must be backed up by economic and military strength. In our era of rapidly advancing technology, both economic and military strength are directly dependent on investments in early-stage, enabling technologies.\n\n\nThis competition is a marathon, not a sprint, and to prevail we have to invest with that in mind. While the Trump administration’s cuts to science in general have been noted, less attention has been paid to the Defense Department’s proposed science and technology funding levels.\n\n\nWe cannot afford to be complacent about our technological superiority. We are well past the point where China can be thought of as a future or emerging challenge.\n\n\nIn the face of this challenge, the Trump administration has proposed a Fiscal Year 2026 budget that reduces funding for enabling technologies – the mix of basic, applied, and advanced technology budget accounts – by over 10% from Fiscal Year 2025 levels, which themselves are roughly flat relative to 2024.\n\n\nSenate Appropriators Reject Trump’s Deep Education Cuts\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/08/01/senate-appropriators-reject-trumps-education-dept\n\nSenate Republicans are planning to protect the Pell Grant program, keeping the maximum grant award at $7,395 for the coming academic year, despite the Trump administration’s proposal to lower it to $5,710.\n\n\nIt also set new staffing standards for the recently gutted Department of Education, increased funding for medical research by $400 million and rejected the National Institutes of Health’s attempt to cap indirect research cost reimbursements at 15 percent.\n\n\nOver all, the Department of Education is going to receive $79 billion and the NIH will get $48.7 billion. In comparison, Trump had requested $66.7 billion for ED and $27.5 billion for NIH.\n\n\n“These are not the bills I would have written on my own, but nonetheless they represent serious bipartisan work to make some truly critical investments in our country and families’ future,” said Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat and ranking member of the committee. Still, she added, this is only half the battle. “The fact of the matter is we have an administration right now that is intent on ignoring Congress, breaking the law and doing everything it can without transparency to dismantle programs and agencies.”\n\n\n\n\nLawsuit Over NIH Grant Funding Heads to Supreme Court\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/25/lawsuit-over-nih-grant-funding-heads-supreme-court\n\nThe Trump administration has taken its fight over grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health to the Supreme Court, requesting permission Thursday to finalize millions of dollars in award cuts, CBS News reported.\n\n\nThe Trump administration has put a halt on billions in new research grants flowing from the National Institutes of Health, setting up a battle with lawmakers\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-puts-new-chokehold-on-billions-in-health-research-funding-19660215?st=V7YMhi&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nTrump administration halts, then releases, NIH research funding\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/29/trump-administration-nih-funding/\n\nThe halt stemmed from a footnote in an Office of Management and Budget document, according to an email sent to NIH staff Tuesday afternoon by the NIH’s associate director for budget, Neil Shapiro. The OMB gave the NIH its “full-year apportionment” of congressionally mandated funds, Shapiro wrote, but included a footnote limiting what the NIH could spend the money on.\n\n\nFinance officials within the agency “interpreted this footnote to permit NIH obligations only for salaries, administrative expenses, and Clinical Center expenses,” Shapiro wrote. But research money including “research grant, R & D contract, or training awards cannot be issued during this pause,” Shapiro wrote.\n\n\nIf the money had not later been unfrozen, the move would have affected about $15 billion in federal funds, according to the office of Sen. Patty Murray (Washington), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\n\nNIH director says cuts aim to reduce ‘ideological research,’ focus on health\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/07/29/nih-trump-bhattacharya-budget/\n\nIn June, NIH staffers issued the Bethesda Declaration, now signed by 484 employees, some named, others anonymous. The declaration said that on Bhattacharya’s watch, the Trump administration has forced the NIH “to politicize research by halting high-quality, peer reviewed grants and contracts.” The declaration also accused the administration of “censoring critical research” on subjects including health disparities, health effects of climate change and gender identity.\n\n\n“Making America healthy again,” he said in a recent one-hour interview with The Washington Post, “involves deprioritizing research that doesn’t have a chance of making America healthy, [such as] a lot of ideological research that I think served to create a perception that the NIH is a political organization rather than the scientific organization it actually is.”\n\n(…)\n\nAbrupt Pause, Unpause of Grants Doesn’t End NIH Funding Concerns\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/07/31/abrupt-pause-unpause-grants-doesnt-end-nih\n\nBut before the night was over, the Trump administration appeared to reverse course. In an updated article citing unnamed sources, the Journal reported that unnamed “senior White House officials intervened.” (OMB is part of the executive branch.) The Journal said officials at the Health and Human Services Department, which includes NIH, fought the pause for days, but OMB only relented after the newspaper published its initial story Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Judge Blocks Cancellation of NEH Grants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/28/federal-judge-blocks-cancellation-neh-grants\n\nAfederal judge in New York has blocked the Trump administration’s cancellation of $175 million in National Endowment for the Humanities grants allegedly related to diversity, equity and inclusion; gender ideology; or “environmental justice.”\n\n\nIn a ruling issued Friday, Judge Colleen McMahon of the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York, said the agency violated the First Amendment in ordering the cancellation of grants “based on the recipients’ perceived viewpoint, in an effort to drive such views out of the marketplace of ideas.”\n\n\nLast week Judge McMahon determined that the plaintiffs “demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim” and ordered the government to release funding for the impacted grants while litigation continues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Professors Who Supported the Student Deportation Frenzy\n\nhttps://www.dropsitenews.com/p/documenting-jew-hatred-campus-professors-student-deportations-betar-canary-mission?r=q0z6x&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web\n(Thanks JC)\n\nThroughout November and into December, the DJHC account continued celebrating the prospect of student deportations. And on December 5, a couple months before such deportations began in earnest, Jeffrey Lax—chair of the business department at Kingsborough College at the City University of New York (CUNY)—joined the advisory board of DJHC. S.A.F.E. Campus, an organization that Lax had founded in 2023, was already serving as DJHC’s fiscal sponsor, which allowed the newer group to receive tax-exempt donations.\n\n\nOn the DHJC board of advisors, Lax is joined by prominent pro-Israel agitator and former Columbia business professor Shai Davidai, who has long been trying to penalize pro-Palestine voices at the university, and who has also participated in a Columbia alumni WhatsApp group where members aimed to identify student protesters and call for their expulsion, firing, or deportation. And Lax and Davidai are only the most prominent of a handful of campus affiliates backing such groups. Drop Site News’ reporting reveals that current and former instructors at least four schools across the northeastern U.S. have publicly supported Betar, DJHC, and Canary Mission. A few of their names appeared on the GoFundMe page for Betar’s fundraising push last fall and winter.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard’s Powerful Leader Faces Intense Scrutiny in Trump Fight\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/26/us/harvard-penny-pritzker.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAs Harvard and the government negotiate to end a conflict with billions of dollars on the line, some ask whether Penny Pritzker, the head of the school’s governing board, should step down.\n\n(And just who are “some”)\n\nIn the high-stakes negotiations between the Trump administration and Harvard University, the White House and a growing number of people at Harvard have at least one shared goal. They want Penny Pritzker, the head of the university’s top governing board, out.\n\n(Others include Mr. Ackman, Linda McMahon, so not so many…)\n\nThe quiet academic leading Harvard’s fight against Trump\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/25/alan-garber-harvard-president-trump-administration/\n\nGarber, now president of Harvard, will need all his reserves of equanimity — and his commitment to a range of viewpoints on campus — as he leads the nation’s oldest private university through a historic confrontation with the president of the United States.\n\n\nNow Harvard is facing an even greater crisis. President Donald Trump has lashed out at colleges and universities for alleged antisemitism and is seeking to force profound changes in higher education. The government has targeted Harvard, freezing billions in federal research funding, launching a flurry of investigations and attempting to block international students and scholars from the university. Harvard is challenging the administration’s actions in court as unlawful intrusions on its autonomy.\n\n\nHarvard’s decision to fight the government stands in stark contrast to the path taken by Columbia University, which announced Wednesday that it had reached a deal with the Trump administration.\n\n\nAs Garber weighs the choices ahead, his horizon goes far beyond Trump and this administration, colleagues say. “He is thinking about Harvard in 2125,” said Alison Frank Johnson, a professor of history at Harvard who has known Garber for more than a decade. “He’s thinking about protecting the university over the very long term.”\n\n\nTrump puts pressure on Harvard and others to pay up, after Columbia deal\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/25/harvard-columbia-university-trump-deal/\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nThe administration is seeking payments from the University of Michigan as well as Northwestern, Cornell and Brown universities, in an effort to make deals similar to the $200 million agreement announced Wednesday with Columbia University.\n\n\nThe financial dragnet could impact dozens of other colleges and universities that are also facing — or were threatened with — investigations by the Trump administration, the White House said.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-columbia-trump-white-house-fines-payment-deal-settlement-d61aa9c6\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Is Said to Be Open to Spending Up to $500 Million to Resolve Trump Dispute\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/us/politics/trump-harvard-payment.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(I didn’t believe the 200M for Columbia, and will double down on that belief here…)\n\nHarvard University has signaled a willingness to meet the Trump administration’s demand to spend as much as $500 million to end its dispute with the White House as talks between the two sides intensify, four people familiar with the negotiations said.\n\n\nAccording to one of the people, Harvard is reluctant to directly pay the federal government, but negotiators are still discussing the exact financial terms.\n\n\nPresident Trump has privately demanded that Harvard pay far more than Columbia. The people who described the talks and the dynamics surrounding them spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations.\n\n(Yes, who is on background here…)\n\nAlthough the two sides have made progress toward a deal, Harvard is also skeptical of Columbia’s agreement to allow an outside monitor to oversee its sweeping arrangement with the government. Harvard officials have signaled that such a requirement for their own settlement could be a redline as a potential infringement on the university’s academic freedom.\n\n\nPenn agreed to apologies and policy changes but no financial penalties. But the administration has been eyeing Harvard’s wealth for months, and Trump aides believe that the university is able to pay much more than Columbia did.\n\n(And why is ability to pay the key factor …)\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Will Share Employee Forms With Federal Government\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/us/politics/harvard-employee-forms-trump-administration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe government can request the employment eligibility verification forms related to citizenship and immigration status as a matter of course, but Harvard was surprised to receive such a voluminous demand.\n\n\nThe government’s request was broad — it asked for the I-9 forms for all Harvard employees, as well as anyone else employed by the university over the previous year — but not altogether unusual. Federal officials have long had, and used, the authority to scrutinize the records, and the Trump administration has routinely harnessed that power in recent months.\n\n\nHarvard’s human resources office said Tuesday that it was not “at this time” giving the government access to forms completed by people who were in jobs “only open to students” as it weighed whether an educational privacy law protected those documents. Otherwise, the university said, it “intends to comply with federal law and accordingly will provide the requested records.”\n\n\nHarvard, though, suggested it was surprised by the scale of the request, noting that “the government does not ordinarily ask an employer to disclose all of its employees’ Form I-9s and their supporting materials.”\n\n\nHHS Accuses Harvard of Thwarting Investigations\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/01/hhs-accuses-harvard-thwarting-investigations\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a letter to Harvard president Alan Garber that it was referring the civil rights investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice, which it is permitted to do in cases where “compliance under Title VI cannot be obtained voluntarily.”\n\n\nThe letter, written by Paula Stannard, director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights, also referenced legal actions taken by Harvard, which has fought back against frozen federal research funding and other matters.\n\n\nUnder Pressure From Trump, the Accreditor Overseeing Harvard Proposes Nixing DEI Standards\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/under-pressure-from-trump-the-accreditor-overseeing-harvard-proposes-nixing-dei-standards\n\n\n\n\nColumbia agreed to a monitor, stoking fears about independence\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/26/columbia-university-settlement-monitor/\n\nTo critics, the deal represents an unprecedented governmental intrusion into the affairs of a private university that could erode the independence of universities across the country. The White House has said it sees this agreement as a template for other schools that it is investigating for allegations of antisemitism and racial discrimination.\n\n\nMuch of the oversight will relate to diversity, equity and inclusion, as the Trump administration seeks to stamp out any effort by Columbia to increase racial diversity in its student body, faculty or staff. The monitor will also be charged with assuring that university programs do not promote “unlawful DEI goals” — a term that is not defined.\n\n\nUnder the agreement, Columbia is required to provide the monitor with detailed information about the race of students who are admitted and rejected, including grade point averages and standardized test scores broken down by race. All data related to faculty and administrative staff hiring and promotion practices must be provided to the monitor annually, and hiring data will be subject to a “comprehensive audit.”\n\n\n\n\n\nFresh Air: The Shifting Landscape Of Higher Education\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/07/24/1256157824/higher-education-george-mason\n\nSo why are they now investigating George Mason University?

Washington is contending with a hostile Board of Visitors and no protection from the state’s attorney general.\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate is demanding that the board provide the “strongest defense possible” of Washington, George Mason’s first Black president, and the university’s diversity initiatives, as the Justice and Education Departments probe whether GMU has engaged in race-based hiring and discriminatory admissions practices and failed to address antisemitism.\n\n\n“President Washington has shown every indication of consistently and faithfully exercising compliance with evolving directives from federal and Commonwealth authorities,” the resolution states. “Evidence, truth, and due process should be the foundation for all decisions, not allegations that have not been fully investigated.”\n\n\nFaculty Support of George Mason’s President Draws Federal Investigation\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/us/justice-department-george-mason-faculty-senate-investigation.html\n(Thanks JC and KK)\n\nProfessors quickly published a resolution supporting their president and the university’s efforts around diversity.\n\n\nNow, Justice Department officials say they will investigate the faculty, too.\n\n\nIn a letter sent on Friday, the Trump administration said it would seek drafts of the faculty resolution, all written communications among the Faculty Senate members who drafted the resolution, and all communications between those faculty members and the office of the university’s president, Gregory Washington.\n\n\nFree speech advocates quickly denounced the move as an attack on academic freedom.\n\n\nFaculty senate resolutions are positions taken by a university’s elected faculty body, like the one at George Mason. They typically carry no force and normally attract little notice beyond the campus newspaper. But these are not normal times for higher education.\n\n\nSolon Simmons, a sociologist who is president of the Faculty Senate, called the government’s inquiry “flabbergasting.”\n\n\n“None of us has any idea why the Department of Justice is so interested in a matter of local academic shared governance,” Dr. Simmons wrote in an email.\n\n\n“An outcome the Board committed to was to ‘faculty and staff demographics that mirror student demographics,’” Dr. Simmons said. “It is not our language, it is theirs.”\n\n\n”While FIRE would prefer governing bodies such as faculty senates remain neutral on issues of political contention,” she said, “the federal government’s actions represent the latest in a pattern of shakedowns against colleges and universities that will certainly chill faculty speech.”\n\n\nDOJ to review staff texts, emails after faculty praise of GMU president\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/educat\n\nThree takeaways from what DOJ told UVA\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/2025/07/29/what-doj-letters-uva-say-about-trump-attack-higher-ed\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nIn a series of seven letters obtained by Inside Higher Ed via an open records request, Dhillon and other Department of Justice officials laid out their increasingly aggressive case that the university was at risk of losing federal funding, just as Ivy League institutions like Harvard and Columbia Universities had in the months prior for allegations of antisemitism. The Cavalier Daily first published the letters in full.\n\n\nTaken together, the letters sent between April 11 and June 17 were used to launch what the DOJ called an investigation but that legal experts say is among the latest instances in an all-out pressure campaign against higher education.\n\n\nBut now, with similar investigations launched against George Mason University (also located in Virginia), many onlookers view these letters as a template for how President Trump will continue to leverage federal funding to impose his priorities on colleges and universities across the country—altering who is admitted and what is taught and by whom. Higher education experts say it’s an aggressive tactic that will create a climate of uncertainty for years to come.\n\n\nJudge Removes Youngkin’s University Board Picks\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/state-policy/2025/07/30/judge-removes-youngkins-university-board-picks\n\nRepublican governor Glenn Youngkin was overruled Tuesday as a Virginia circuit court ordered eight of his nominees be removed from their posts on three public universities’ boards, the Associated Press reported and court records confirm.\n\n\nBut Youngkin and his attorney general, Jason Miyares, instructed board chairs to proceed in welcoming the nominees as members, citing a provision in the state Constitution that says all gubernatorial appointees must be approved by the General Assembly.\n\n\nGregory Washington’s Gamble—The president of George Mason — and faculty leaders — may be punished for defending university policies.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/gregory-washingtons-gamble\n\nNYTimes: George Mason President Holds Job After Attacks on His Diversity Views\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/01/us/george-masons-president-gregory-washington-republicans-diversity.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAt a closed-door meeting that lasted more than three hours on Friday, a board packed with conservative appointees of the state’s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, had convened to discuss the president’s fate. They emerged without making any moves to remove the president for the moment.\n\n\nThough the board did not take action on Dr. Washington’s job, during the open-door session, its members passed a resolution that supported a “merit-based approach” to student success and faculty and staff hiring, ordered cooperation with the federal government’s investigations, and prohibited requiring diversity statements in hiring.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/08/01/george-mason-president-raise-dei-resolution/\n\nGMU board approves DEI resolution, 1.5 percent raise for embattled president.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/in-a-plot-twist-george-masons-politically-embattled-president-gets-a-raise\n\n\n\nTrump Administration Freezes $108 Million in Funds to Duke University - The New York Times\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/us/politics/trump-duke-university-frozen-funding-discrimination.html\n\nDuke University is the latest high-profile school, from Columbia University to Harvard, that the Trump administration has targeted and stripped of a large amount of federal funding, based on vague accusations that the university abets antisemitism or supports diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The move comes amid a wider pressure campaign from the Trump administration to shift the ideological tilt of American higher education.\n\n\nThe university is weighing layoffs amid a budget crunch. It’s considering about $350 million in cuts, amounting to roughly 10 percent of its budget. In a video message last month, Duke’s president, Vincent E. Price, said the university was trying to sort out proposals from the federal government “that have quite dire implications for the university.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown University Makes a Deal With the White House to Restore Funding - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/us/brown-university-makes-a-deal-with-the-white-house-to-restore-funding.html\n\nThe university, which is in Providence, R.I., secured a pledge from the government that the deal would not be used “to dictate Brown’s curriculum or the content of academic speech.” The Trump administration is also required to restore millions of dollars in federal research funding that it had blocked in recent months, and Brown avoided the naming of an independent monitor to oversee the deal.\n\n\nDr. Paxson appeared to sense the prospect of a backlash, even as she promoted the agreement, devoting more than 350 words of her letter to explain why Brown had elected to negotiate.\n\n\nBefore her school came under such direct pressure from the White House, Dr. Paxson was more vocal than many higher education leaders about the Trump administration’s tactics against prominent universities. In March, she said that the administration’s “demands raise new and previously unthinkable questions about the future of academic freedom and self-governance for those that are committed to continuing to serve this country as leading research institutions.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/30/brown-strikes-deal-trump-administration\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/brown-u-s-deal-with-trump-restores-research-funding-without-paying-a-government-fine\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/us/brown-trump-deal-university-funding.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/brown-trump-deal-federal-funds-research-50-million-25b1e8bd?st=5T1JB4&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: University of California Settles With Jewish Students Over U.C.L.A. Protests\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/us/ucla-jewish-students-settlement.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn the lawsuit, three Jewish students and a Jewish professor said that the university had countenanced antisemitic behavior at a tent encampment set up in 2024 by protesters demonstrating against the war in Gaza.\n\n\nThe plaintiffs said the university had not intervened when protesters prevented students who were wearing Jewish symbols like a star of David or the Israeli flag or a skullcap from crossing campus. The university even provided the barricades used to keep people out and stationed security guards on campus who sent Jewish students away instead of helping them get through, the court papers said.\n\n\nThe settlement, announced Tuesday, will require the university to give $6.45 million, including legal fees, to the plaintiffs and to charitable entities. The money will also support the university’s own efforts to combat antisemitism and support the Jewish community on campus.\n\n\nJust hours after the settlement was announced, the Department of Justice said it had found U.C.L.A. in violation of civil rights law and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment for failing to adequately respond to complaints of “severe, pervasive and objectively offensive harassment and abuse” of Jewish and Israeli students during the protest encampment in the spring of 2024.\n\n\nThe department sent a 10-page letter to Dr. Michael V. Drake, president of the University of California, laying out the evidence it had reviewed, including the lawsuit. It said that the department was now looking to enter into a voluntary resolution agreement with U.C.L.A. or go to court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Saving for College Once Felt Essential. Some Parents Are Rethinking Their Plans.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/26/business/529-parents-saving-college.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFor generations, 529 college savings plans were a no-brainer for most parents wanting to start a college fund. They are tax-advantaged and primarily used to pay for higher education expenses. The accounts can be used for a range of education-related expenses, not just college tuition, like books, private K-12 tuition and more. If funds go unused, the account can be transferred to another beneficiary, like a sibling or a grandchild.\n\n\nBut now, some parents are pumping the brakes on the accounts and rethinking how they plan to save for their children’s future. With growing uncertainty around the value of higher education, and a fear of locking funds into something their child may not use, many of these parents are looking for flexible plans that don’t tie their money exclusively to higher education.\n\n\nNearly 600 Duke Employees Take Buyouts\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/28/nearly-600-duke-employees-take-buyouts\n\nNearly 600 employees have accepted buyouts at Duke University, opting into a voluntary separation incentive program prompted by threats to federal research funding, WRAL reported.\n\n\nDuke officials said they also plan to start involuntary layoffs in August, even though 599 staff members took buyouts.

What?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/newsletter/the-review/2025-07-28\n(Thanks BE!!)\n\n“As in earlier rounds of hearings, the leaders tried hard to depict their institutions as eager to quash any sign of the putative scourge of anti-Jewish hatred on campus….[ Interim President of Georgetown Robert M. Groves said] that, since the October 7 attacks, Georgetown has ‘learned that we need to adapt to changing circumstances, almost continuously.’”\n\n\n“A congressional hearing is presumably one such circumstance; Groves had to adapt in real time to North Carolina Republican Virginia Foxx’s campaign against a Georgetown faculty member’s [ Jonathan A.C. Brown’s] right to extramural political speech. [ Brown is cited for his tweet saying, “I hope Iran does some symbolic strike on a [US military] base.”]\n\n\n“As far as academic freedom goes, this isn’t remotely an edge case. Brown’s speech is obviously protected. He is commenting both as a scholar of the region (one who is careful, indeed, to note the limits of his own expertise) and as a citizen about a major geopolitical event.”\n\n\n“Jonathan A.C. Brown is being investigated by Georgetown and condemned by Congress precisely for “speech in the public domain.” Given the susceptibility of campus discourse on the Middle East to Congressional censure, it is hard not to hear, in Groves’s blithe assurance that he and his fellow administrators ‘police’ their professors, something more intrusive than the rhetoric of academic rights and responsibilities.”",

Any discipline leveled against Professor Kassem for his representation of Mr. Khalil would violate AAUP standards on academic freedom and tenure and the terms of CUNY’s faculty labor contract. Even more critically, such discipline would contravene Professor Kassem’s constitutionally-protected speech and association. Federal courts have interpreted the First Amendment to protect the right of faculty to engage in an “independent and uninhibited exchange of ideas” as well as the right of the university to engage in “autonomous decisionmaking” free of legislative or, for that matter, judicial control.1 Courts have interpreted the First Amendment to prohibit efforts by the government to “usurp” the right of academic institutions to “determine [for themselves] who may teach” or “what may be taught.” Professor Kassem’s representation of Mr. Khalil as part of his clinical practice falls squarely within these protections.\n\n\nThe National AAUP stands in staunch support of Professor Ramzi Kassem’s academic and constitutional freedoms, and we will continue to closely watch CUNY’s defense of its faculty.\n\nhttps://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/2025-07/Letter-AAUP-CUNY-July-2025.pdf\n(The NYS AAUP has also written a letter regarding personnel decisions at Brooklyn College.)",

The directive applies to any organization that receives federal funds, and DOJ officials warned that engaging in potentially unlawful practices could lead to a loss in grant funding.\n\n\nLynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, said that the memo is “another example of governmental overreach into academic freedom, institutional autonomy and shared governance that conditions federal funding on ideological alignment with the administration’s viewpoints.”",

Schroeder breast-cancer research lab at the University of Arizona suggested starting a GoFundMe campaign because “family members would likely be willing to chip in to support her research, particularly since several relatives have had breast cancer.”\n\n\n“’It was odd to me, because I don’t really think of our research lab as a place that would need charity,’ DiFranco said, noting that campaigns on GoFundMe often benefit individuals or families facing medical crises, natural disasters, or other emergencies.”\n\n\n“It’s a long-running joke among academics waiting for news on their grant proposals: ‘If it’s not funded,’ they say, ‘we’ll just have a bake sale.’”\n\n\n“… crowdfunding in academe isn’t an entirely new notion. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2016 created an online FAQ page on best practices for crowdfunding research.”\n\n\n“Experiment, a science-specific fund-raising site, has been around since 2012 and has raised more than $12 million in support of 1,351 different projects. It’s an all-or-nothing funding platform, meaning that donors are only charged if the project reaches its fund-raising goal, and it also sends proceeds directly to the institutions its researchers are affiliated with.”\n\n\nBy cutting science, the Defense Department is eating its seed corn\n\n(Thanks MP!)\nhttps://www.defensenews.com/opinion/2025/07/24/by-cutting-science-the-defense-department-is-eating-its-seed-corn/\n\nWe are in a long-term strategic competition with China that has diplomatic, economic, and military components. To be effective, diplomacy must be backed up by economic and military strength. In our era of rapidly advancing technology, both economic and military strength are directly dependent on investments in early-stage, enabling technologies.\n\n\nThis competition is a marathon, not a sprint, and to prevail we have to invest with that in mind. While the Trump administration’s cuts to science in general have been noted, less attention has been paid to the Defense Department’s proposed science and technology funding levels.\n\n\nWe cannot afford to be complacent about our technological superiority. We are well past the point where China can be thought of as a future or emerging challenge.\n\n\nIn the face of this challenge, the Trump administration has proposed a Fiscal Year 2026 budget that reduces funding for enabling technologies – the mix of basic, applied, and advanced technology budget accounts – by over 10% from Fiscal Year 2025 levels, which themselves are roughly flat relative to 2024.\n\n\nSenate Appropriators Reject Trump’s Deep Education Cuts\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/08/01/senate-appropriators-reject-trumps-education-dept\n\nSenate Republicans are planning to protect the Pell Grant program, keeping the maximum grant award at $7,395 for the coming academic year, despite the Trump administration’s proposal to lower it to $5,710.\n\n\nIt also set new staffing standards for the recently gutted Department of Education, increased funding for medical research by $400 million and rejected the National Institutes of Health’s attempt to cap indirect research cost reimbursements at 15 percent.\n\n\nOver all, the Department of Education is going to receive $79 billion and the NIH will get $48.7 billion. In comparison, Trump had requested $66.7 billion for ED and $27.5 billion for NIH.\n\n\n“These are not the bills I would have written on my own, but nonetheless they represent serious bipartisan work to make some truly critical investments in our country and families’ future,” said Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat and ranking member of the committee. Still, she added, this is only half the battle. “The fact of the matter is we have an administration right now that is intent on ignoring Congress, breaking the law and doing everything it can without transparency to dismantle programs and agencies.”\n\n\n\n\nLawsuit Over NIH Grant Funding Heads to Supreme Court\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/25/lawsuit-over-nih-grant-funding-heads-supreme-court\n\nThe Trump administration has taken its fight over grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health to the Supreme Court, requesting permission Thursday to finalize millions of dollars in award cuts, CBS News reported.\n\n\nThe Trump administration has put a halt on billions in new research grants flowing from the National Institutes of Health, setting up a battle with lawmakers\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-puts-new-chokehold-on-billions-in-health-research-funding-19660215?st=V7YMhi&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nTrump administration halts, then releases, NIH research funding\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/29/trump-administration-nih-funding/\n\nThe halt stemmed from a footnote in an Office of Management and Budget document, according to an email sent to NIH staff Tuesday afternoon by the NIH’s associate director for budget, Neil Shapiro. The OMB gave the NIH its “full-year apportionment” of congressionally mandated funds, Shapiro wrote, but included a footnote limiting what the NIH could spend the money on.\n\n\nFinance officials within the agency “interpreted this footnote to permit NIH obligations only for salaries, administrative expenses, and Clinical Center expenses,” Shapiro wrote. But research money including “research grant, R & D contract, or training awards cannot be issued during this pause,” Shapiro wrote.\n\n\nIf the money had not later been unfrozen, the move would have affected about $15 billion in federal funds, according to the office of Sen. Patty Murray (Washington), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\n\nNIH director says cuts aim to reduce ‘ideological research,’ focus on health\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/07/29/nih-trump-bhattacharya-budget/\n\nIn June, NIH staffers issued the Bethesda Declaration, now signed by 484 employees, some named, others anonymous. The declaration said that on Bhattacharya’s watch, the Trump administration has forced the NIH “to politicize research by halting high-quality, peer reviewed grants and contracts.” The declaration also accused the administration of “censoring critical research” on subjects including health disparities, health effects of climate change and gender identity.\n\n\n“Making America healthy again,” he said in a recent one-hour interview with The Washington Post, “involves deprioritizing research that doesn’t have a chance of making America healthy, [such as] a lot of ideological research that I think served to create a perception that the NIH is a political organization rather than the scientific organization it actually is.”\n\n(…)\n\nAbrupt Pause, Unpause of Grants Doesn’t End NIH Funding Concerns\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/07/31/abrupt-pause-unpause-grants-doesnt-end-nih\n\nBut before the night was over, the Trump administration appeared to reverse course. In an updated article citing unnamed sources, the Journal reported that unnamed “senior White House officials intervened.” (OMB is part of the executive branch.) The Journal said officials at the Health and Human Services Department, which includes NIH, fought the pause for days, but OMB only relented after the newspaper published its initial story Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Judge Blocks Cancellation of NEH Grants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/28/federal-judge-blocks-cancellation-neh-grants\n\nAfederal judge in New York has blocked the Trump administration’s cancellation of $175 million in National Endowment for the Humanities grants allegedly related to diversity, equity and inclusion; gender ideology; or “environmental justice.”\n\n\nIn a ruling issued Friday, Judge Colleen McMahon of the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York, said the agency violated the First Amendment in ordering the cancellation of grants “based on the recipients’ perceived viewpoint, in an effort to drive such views out of the marketplace of ideas.”\n\n\nLast week Judge McMahon determined that the plaintiffs “demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim” and ordered the government to release funding for the impacted grants while litigation continues.",

And on December 5, a couple months before such deportations began in earnest, Jeffrey Lax—chair of the business department at Kingsborough College at the City University of New York (CUNY)—joined the advisory board of DJHC. S.A.F.E. Campus, an organization that Lax had founded in 2023, was already serving as DJHC’s fiscal sponsor, which allowed the newer group to receive tax-exempt donations.\n\n\nOn the DHJC board of advisors, Lax is joined by prominent pro-Israel agitator and former Columbia business professor Shai Davidai, who has long been trying to penalize pro-Palestine voices at the university, and who has also participated in a Columbia alumni WhatsApp group where members aimed to identify student protesters and call for their expulsion, firing, or deportation. And Lax and Davidai are only the most prominent of a handful of campus affiliates backing such groups. Drop Site News’ reporting reveals that current and former instructors at least four schools across the northeastern U.S. have publicly supported Betar, DJHC, and Canary Mission. A few of their names appeared on the GoFundMe page for Betar’s fundraising push last fall and winter.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard’s Powerful Leader Faces Intense Scrutiny in Trump Fight\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/26/us/harvard-penny-pritzker.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAs Harvard and the government negotiate to end a conflict with billions of dollars on the line, some ask whether Penny Pritzker, the head of the school’s governing board, should step down.\n\n(And just who are “some”)\n\nIn the high-stakes negotiations between the Trump administration and Harvard University, the White House and a growing number of people at Harvard have at least one shared goal. They want Penny Pritzker, the head of the university’s top governing board, out.\n\n(Others include Mr. Ackman, Linda McMahon, so not so many…)\n\nThe quiet academic leading Harvard’s fight against Trump\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/25/alan-garber-harvard-president-trump-administration/\n\nGarber, now president of Harvard, will need all his reserves of equanimity — and his commitment to a range of viewpoints on campus — as he leads the nation’s oldest private university through a historic confrontation with the president of the United States.\n\n\nNow Harvard is facing an even greater crisis. President Donald Trump has lashed out at colleges and universities for alleged antisemitism and is seeking to force profound changes in higher education. The government has targeted Harvard, freezing billions in federal research funding, launching a flurry of investigations and attempting to block international students and scholars from the university. Harvard is challenging the administration’s actions in court as unlawful intrusions on its autonomy.\n\n\nHarvard’s decision to fight the government stands in stark contrast to the path taken by Columbia University, which announced Wednesday that it had reached a deal with the Trump administration.\n\n\nAs Garber weighs the choices ahead, his horizon goes far beyond Trump and this administration, colleagues say. “He is thinking about Harvard in 2125,” said Alison Frank Johnson, a professor of history at Harvard who has known Garber for more than a decade. “He’s thinking about protecting the university over the very long term.”\n\n\nTrump puts pressure on Harvard and others to pay up, after Columbia deal\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/25/harvard-columbia-university-trump-deal/\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nThe administration is seeking payments from the University of Michigan as well as Northwestern, Cornell and Brown universities, in an effort to make deals similar to the $200 million agreement announced Wednesday with Columbia University.\n\n\nThe financial dragnet could impact dozens of other colleges and universities that are also facing — or were threatened with — investigations by the Trump administration, the White House said.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-columbia-trump-white-house-fines-payment-deal-settlement-d61aa9c6\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Is Said to Be Open to Spending Up to $500 Million to Resolve Trump Dispute\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/us/politics/trump-harvard-payment.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(I didn’t believe the 200M for Columbia, and will double down on that belief here…)\n\nHarvard University has signaled a willingness to meet the Trump administration’s demand to spend as much as $500 million to end its dispute with the White House as talks between the two sides intensify, four people familiar with the negotiations said.\n\n\nAccording to one of the people, Harvard is reluctant to directly pay the federal government, but negotiators are still discussing the exact financial terms.\n\n\nPresident Trump has privately demanded that Harvard pay far more than Columbia. The people who described the talks and the dynamics surrounding them spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations.\n\n(Yes, who is on background here…)\n\nAlthough the two sides have made progress toward a deal, Harvard is also skeptical of Columbia’s agreement to allow an outside monitor to oversee its sweeping arrangement with the government. Harvard officials have signaled that such a requirement for their own settlement could be a redline as a potential infringement on the university’s academic freedom.\n\n\nPenn agreed to apologies and policy changes but no financial penalties. But the administration has been eyeing Harvard’s wealth for months, and Trump aides believe that the university is able to pay much more than Columbia did.\n\n(And why is ability to pay the key factor …)\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Will Share Employee Forms With Federal Government\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/us/politics/harvard-employee-forms-trump-administration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe government can request the employment eligibility verification forms related to citizenship and immigration status as a matter of course, but Harvard was surprised to receive such a voluminous demand.\n\n\nThe government’s request was broad — it asked for the I-9 forms for all Harvard employees, as well as anyone else employed by the university over the previous year — but not altogether unusual. Federal officials have long had, and used, the authority to scrutinize the records, and the Trump administration has routinely harnessed that power in recent months.\n\n\nHarvard’s human resources office said Tuesday that it was not “at this time” giving the government access to forms completed by people who were in jobs “only open to students” as it weighed whether an educational privacy law protected those documents. Otherwise, the university said, it “intends to comply with federal law and accordingly will provide the requested records.”\n\n\nHarvard, though, suggested it was surprised by the scale of the request, noting that “the government does not ordinarily ask an employer to disclose all of its employees’ Form I-9s and their supporting materials.”\n\n\nHHS Accuses Harvard of Thwarting Investigations\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/08/01/hhs-accuses-harvard-thwarting-investigations\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a letter to Harvard president Alan Garber that it was referring the civil rights investigation to the U.S. Department of Justice, which it is permitted to do in cases where “compliance under Title VI cannot be obtained voluntarily.”\n\n\nThe letter, written by Paula Stannard, director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights, also referenced legal actions taken by Harvard, which has fought back against frozen federal research funding and other matters.\n\n\nUnder Pressure From Trump, the Accreditor Overseeing Harvard Proposes Nixing DEI Standards\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/under-pressure-from-trump-the-accreditor-overseeing-harvard-proposes-nixing-dei-standards\n\n\n\n\nColumbia agreed to a monitor, stoking fears about independence\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/07/26/columbia-university-settlement-monitor/\n\nTo critics, the deal represents an unprecedented governmental intrusion into the affairs of a private university that could erode the independence of universities across the country. The White House has said it sees this agreement as a template for other schools that it is investigating for allegations of antisemitism and racial discrimination.\n\n\nMuch of the oversight will relate to diversity, equity and inclusion, as the Trump administration seeks to stamp out any effort by Columbia to increase racial diversity in its student body, faculty or staff. The monitor will also be charged with assuring that university programs do not promote “unlawful DEI goals” — a term that is not defined.\n\n\nUnder the agreement, Columbia is required to provide the monitor with detailed information about the race of students who are admitted and rejected, including grade point averages and standardized test scores broken down by race. All data related to faculty and administrative staff hiring and promotion practices must be provided to the monitor annually, and hiring data will be subject to a “comprehensive audit.”\n\n\n\n\n\nFresh Air: The Shifting Landscape Of Higher Education\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/07/24/1256157824/higher-education-george-mason\n\nSo why are they now investigating George Mason University? ProPublica education reporter Katherine Mangan tells us why GMU’s president thinks it’s driven by a backlash to DEI efforts.\n\n\nOn the Media:\n\nhttps://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm\n\n[19:23] Host Micah Loewinger speaks with Katherine Mangan, a senior writer at The Chronicle of Higher Education, about the recent investigations launched into George Mason University by the Trump administration, and the media campaign that followed suit.\n\n\nGeorge Mason U. Faculty Rally Around Their Besieged President. They May Be His Only Support.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/george-mason-u-faculty-rally-around-their-besieged-president-they-may-be-his-only-support\n\nGeorge Mason University’s Faculty Senate has ramped up its support of the university’s president, Gregory Washington, as the institution faces four federal investigations that some observers believe are designed to force his ouster. Washington is contending with a hostile Board of Visitors and no protection from the state’s attorney general.\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate is demanding that the board provide the “strongest defense possible” of Washington, George Mason’s first Black president, and the university’s diversity initiatives, as the Justice and Education Departments probe whether GMU has engaged in race-based hiring and discriminatory admissions practices and failed to address antisemitism.\n\n\n“President Washington has shown every indication of consistently and faithfully exercising compliance with evolving directives from federal and Commonwealth authorities,” the resolution states. “Evidence, truth, and due process should be the foundation for all decisions, not allegations that have not been fully investigated.”\n\n\nFaculty Support of George Mason’s President Draws Federal Investigation\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/us/justice-department-george-mason-faculty-senate-investigation.html\n(Thanks JC and KK)\n\nProfessors quickly published a resolution supporting their president and the university’s efforts around diversity.\n\n\nNow, Justice Department officials say they will investigate the faculty, too.\n\n\nIn a letter sent on Friday, the Trump administration said it would seek drafts of the faculty resolution, all written communications among the Faculty Senate members who drafted the resolution, and all communications between those faculty members and the office of the university’s president, Gregory Washington.\n\n\nFree speech advocates quickly denounced the move as an attack on academic freedom.\n\n\nFaculty senate resolutions are positions taken by a university’s elected faculty body, like the one at George Mason. They typically carry no force and normally attract little notice beyond the campus newspaper. But these are not normal times for higher education.\n\n\nSolon Simmons, a sociologist who is president of the Faculty Senate, called the government’s inquiry “flabbergasting.”\n\n\n“None of us has any idea why the Department of Justice is so interested in a matter of local academic shared governance,” Dr. Simmons wrote in an email.\n\n\n“An outcome the Board committed to was to ‘faculty and staff demographics that mirror student demographics,’” Dr. Simmons said. “It is not our language, it is theirs.”\n\n\n”While FIRE would prefer governing bodies such as faculty senates remain neutral on issues of political contention,” she said, “the federal government’s actions represent the latest in a pattern of shakedowns against colleges and universities that will certainly chill faculty speech.”\n\n\nDOJ to review staff texts, emails after faculty praise of GMU president\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/educat\n\nThree takeaways from what DOJ told UVA\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/2025/07/29/what-doj-letters-uva-say-about-trump-attack-higher-ed\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nIn a series of seven letters obtained by Inside Higher Ed via an open records request, Dhillon and other Department of Justice officials laid out their increasingly aggressive case that the university was at risk of losing federal funding, just as Ivy League institutions like Harvard and Columbia Universities had in the months prior for allegations of antisemitism. The Cavalier Daily first published the letters in full.\n\n\nTaken together, the letters sent between April 11 and June 17 were used to launch what the DOJ called an investigation but that legal experts say is among the latest instances in an all-out pressure campaign against higher education.\n\n\nBut now, with similar investigations launched against George Mason University (also located in Virginia), many onlookers view these letters as a template for how President Trump will continue to leverage federal funding to impose his priorities on colleges and universities across the country—altering who is admitted and what is taught and by whom. Higher education experts say it’s an aggressive tactic that will create a climate of uncertainty for years to come.\n\n\nJudge Removes Youngkin’s University Board Picks\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/state-policy/2025/07/30/judge-removes-youngkins-university-board-picks\n\nRepublican governor Glenn Youngkin was overruled Tuesday as a Virginia circuit court ordered eight of his nominees be removed from their posts on three public universities’ boards, the Associated Press reported and court records confirm.\n\n\nBut Youngkin and his attorney general, Jason Miyares, instructed board chairs to proceed in welcoming the nominees as members, citing a provision in the state Constitution that says all gubernatorial appointees must be approved by the General Assembly.\n\n\nGregory Washington’s Gamble—The president of George Mason — and faculty leaders — may be punished for defending university policies.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/gregory-washingtons-gamble\n\nNYTimes: George Mason President Holds Job After Attacks on His Diversity Views\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/01/us/george-masons-president-gregory-washington-republicans-diversity.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAt a closed-door meeting that lasted more than three hours on Friday, a board packed with conservative appointees of the state’s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, had convened to discuss the president’s fate. They emerged without making any moves to remove the president for the moment.\n\n\nThough the board did not take action on Dr. Washington’s job, during the open-door session, its members passed a resolution that supported a “merit-based approach” to student success and faculty and staff hiring, ordered cooperation with the federal government’s investigations, and prohibited requiring diversity statements in hiring.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/08/01/george-mason-president-raise-dei-resolution/\n\nGMU board approves DEI resolution, 1.5 percent raise for embattled president.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/in-a-plot-twist-george-masons-politically-embattled-president-gets-a-raise\n\n\n\nTrump Administration Freezes $108 Million in Funds to Duke University - The New York Times\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/us/politics/trump-duke-university-frozen-funding-discrimination.html\n\nDuke University is the latest high-profile school, from Columbia University to Harvard, that the Trump administration has targeted and stripped of a large amount of federal funding, based on vague accusations that the university abets antisemitism or supports diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The move comes amid a wider pressure campaign from the Trump administration to shift the ideological tilt of American higher education.\n\n\nThe university is weighing layoffs amid a budget crunch. It’s considering about $350 million in cuts, amounting to roughly 10 percent of its budget. In a video message last month, Duke’s president, Vincent E. Price, said the university was trying to sort out proposals from the federal government “that have quite dire implications for the university.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown University Makes a Deal With the White House to Restore Funding - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/us/brown-university-makes-a-deal-with-the-white-house-to-restore-funding.html\n\nThe university, which is in Providence, R.I., secured a pledge from the government that the deal would not be used “to dictate Brown’s curriculum or the content of academic speech.” The Trump administration is also required to restore millions of dollars in federal research funding that it had blocked in recent months, and Brown avoided the naming of an independent monitor to oversee the deal.\n\n\nDr. Paxson appeared to sense the prospect of a backlash, even as she promoted the agreement, devoting more than 350 words of her letter to explain why Brown had elected to negotiate.\n\n\nBefore her school came under such direct pressure from the White House, Dr. Paxson was more vocal than many higher education leaders about the Trump administration’s tactics against prominent universities. In March, she said that the administration’s “demands raise new and previously unthinkable questions about the future of academic freedom and self-governance for those that are committed to continuing to serve this country as leading research institutions.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/30/brown-strikes-deal-trump-administration\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/brown-u-s-deal-with-trump-restores-research-funding-without-paying-a-government-fine\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/us/brown-trump-deal-university-funding.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/brown-trump-deal-federal-funds-research-50-million-25b1e8bd?st=5T1JB4&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: University of California Settles With Jewish Students Over U.C.L.A. Protests\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/us/ucla-jewish-students-settlement.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn the lawsuit, three Jewish students and a Jewish professor said that the university had countenanced antisemitic behavior at a tent encampment set up in 2024 by protesters demonstrating against the war in Gaza.\n\n\nThe plaintiffs said the university had not intervened when protesters prevented students who were wearing Jewish symbols like a star of David or the Israeli flag or a skullcap from crossing campus. The university even provided the barricades used to keep people out and stationed security guards on campus who sent Jewish students away instead of helping them get through, the court papers said.\n\n\nThe settlement, announced Tuesday, will require the university to give $6.45 million, including legal fees, to the plaintiffs and to charitable entities. The money will also support the university’s own efforts to combat antisemitism and support the Jewish community on campus.\n\n\nJust hours after the settlement was announced, the Department of Justice said it had found U.C.L.A. in violation of civil rights law and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment for failing to adequately respond to complaints of “severe, pervasive and objectively offensive harassment and abuse” of Jewish and Israeli students during the protest encampment in the spring of 2024.\n\n\nThe department sent a 10-page letter to Dr. Michael V. Drake, president of the University of California, laying out the evidence it had reviewed, including the lawsuit. It said that the department was now looking to enter into a voluntary resolution agreement with U.C.L.A. or go to court.",

The accounts can be used for a range of education-related expenses, not just college tuition, like books, private K-12 tuition and more. If funds go unused, the account can be transferred to another beneficiary, like a sibling or a grandchild.\n\n\nBut now, some parents are pumping the brakes on the accounts and rethinking how they plan to save for their children’s future.

Why Do We Treat Them So Poorly?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/opinion/teachers-education-trump-administration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(SUNY Chancellor on the impact of teachers.)\n\n\n\n\nThe New Dark Age\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/trump-defund-schools-research-republicans/682742/?gift=Je3D9AQS-C17lUTOnl2W8DWsF0Ye4dzmUZWM5fDSO2g&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share\n(This is a crystal clear piece about where this administration is trying to steer things and it is not a good place. It is well worth getting past the paywall to read/)\n\nThe warlords who sacked Rome did not intend to doom Western Europe to centuries of ignorance. It was not a foreseeable consequence of their actions. The same cannot be said of the sweeping attack on human knowledge and progress that the Trump administration is now undertaking—a deliberate destruction of education, science, and history, conducted with a fanaticism that recalls the Dark Ages that followed Rome’s fall.\n\n\nEvery week brings fresh examples. The administration is threatening colleges and universities with the loss of federal funding if they do not submit to its demands, or even if they do. The engines of American scientific inquiry and ingenuity, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, are under sustained attack. Historical institutions such as the Smithsonian and artistic ones like the Kennedy Center are being converted into homes for MAGA ideology rather than historical fact and free expression. Libraries are losing funding, government-employed scientists are being dismissed from their jobs, educators are being cowed into silence, and researchers are being warned not to broach forbidden subjects. Entire databases of public-health information collected over decades are at risk of vanishing. Any facts that contradict the gospel of Trumpism are treated as heretical.\n\n\nLike the inquisitors of old, who persecuted Galileo for daring to notice that the sun did not, in fact, revolve around the Earth, they believe that truth-seeking imperils their hold on power.\n\n\nBut a massive technological stall is only the most apparent aspect of the coming damage. The attack on knowledge also threatens the country’s ability to address subtler social problems, such as racial and economic inequalities in health, opportunity, and civil rights. Research into these disparities is being cut across government and civil society in the name of defeating so-called wokeness. Invoked as a general criticism of left-wing excess, the fight against “wokeness” is destroying huge swaths of scholarship and research, for fear the results might make the case for racial or gender equality, the redistribution of wealth, or the regulation of industry.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s Politics of Plunder\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/donald-trumps-politics-of-plunder\n\nHistorically, ruling billionaires have tried to avoid such portraits. (A publicist for J. P. Morgan used to say that he was “paid to keep the bank out of the press.”) But the Trump Presidency has embraced an unusually open marriage of politics and profit. Official filings revealed that his Inauguration fund set a new record by collecting some two hundred and fifty million dollars from corporations, C.E.O.s, and other large donors. The biggest donation, five million dollars, came from a major poultry producer called Pilgrim’s Pride. A few months later, Trump’s Agriculture Secretary delighted the industry by agreeing not to increase salmonella testing and promising to cut “unnecessary bureaucracy.” By then, Trump had already fired the director of the Office of Government Ethics and the head of the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates whistle-blower complaints.\n\n\non-one conversations with the President have become available for five million. The return on investment is uncertain, a government-affairs executive told me: “What if he’s in a bad mood? You have no clue where the money is eventually going.” Another lobbying veteran described the frank exchange as “outer-borough Mafia shit.”\n\n\nThe ultra-rich have captured more of America’s wealth than even the nineteenth-century tycoons of the Gilded Age. Scholars who study inequality as far back as the Neolithic period struggle to find precedents. Tim Kerig, an archeologist who directs the Museum Alzey, in Germany, told me, “The people who built the Egyptian pyramids were probably in a less unequal society.” He suggested that today’s richest people are simply accumulating too much wealth for the system to contain. “The economic and technical evolution is much faster than the social, mental, and ideological evolution,” he said. “We had no time to adapt to all those billionaires.”\n\n\nFor fifteen years, the Patriotic Millionaires have waged an earnest battle to persuade wealthy people to lobby for higher taxes on themselves. This has often been a lonesome endeavor, but Trump’s assault on democracy, financed by some of America’s richest people, has fortified the group’s arguments. Scott Ellis, a member who used to run a consulting group at Hewlett-Packard, told me that even skeptical peers in Silicon Valley had become increasingly receptive. “Some friends used to humor me, but they’re listening more,” he said.\n\n\nIn the 2004 election, according to Americans for Tax Fairness, billionaires gave thirteen million dollars in political contributions; twenty years later, the country’s richest families spent more than two hundred times that much. Payne told the crowd, “There’s a point where money is no longer money. It is power—and they’re using that power to screw life up for everybody else.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas House OKs more state oversight of public universities | The Texas Tribune\n\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/24/texas-governing-boards-regents-senate-bill-37/\n\nSenate Bill 37 passed in an 83-53 vote Saturday. It would create a state-level committee that would recommend courses that should be required for graduation and how to condense the number of those courses. Meanwhile, each public university system’s board of regents, who oversee the school’s operations and are appointed by the governor, would be charged with creating a committee to review curricula and reject any course deemed ideologically charged or that doesn’t align with the workforce demands. Specifically, the committees would ensure curricula do not “advocate or promote that any race, sex, ethnicity or religious belief is inherently superior to any other.”\n\n(This bill if passed is much more than a glancing blow to higher education’s principles.)\n\nIn Defense of Academic Freedom - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/05/in-defense-of-academic-freedom/682914/\n\nWhy defend academic freedom even when the ideas in question are wrongheaded or harmful? “It is precisely because any kind of purge opens the gate to all kinds of purge, that freedom of thought necessarily means the freedom to think bad thoughts as well as good.”\n\n\nThose words, written in 1953 by Joseph Alsop, an alumnus of Harvard who later served on its Board of Overseers, are relevant today, as the Trump administration cancels the visas of foreign students for viewpoints that it deems “bad.” And they were relevant in recent years as institutions of higher education investigated and disciplined members of their communities for expressing views that ran afoul of various progressive social-justice orthodoxies. But Alsop wrote them in response to the McCarthy era’s efforts to identify and punish Communists who were working in academia.\n\n\nA Tumultuous Spring Semester Finally Comes to a Close | The New Yorker\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/a-tumultuous-spring-semester-finally-comes-to-a-close\n\nThe biggest mistake that some universities have made is to presume that the White House is operating in good faith. It is not.\n\n\nAcademic freedom in the United States has found itself periodically under siege. In March, Ellen Schrecker, a historian and the author of “No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities,” spoke via Zoom to deans at Columbia (including myself) about government repression on college campuses in the nineteen-fifties. Schrecker, who has taught at both Columbia and Harvard and retired as a professor at Yeshiva University, emphasized the severity of the current climate. “I’ve studied McCarthyism’s impact on higher education for fifty years,” she said. “What’s happening now is worse.” This is in part because universities today are far more beholden to the federal government. The explosive expansion of higher education that began after the Second World War was underwritten by federal dollars. So members of Congress, and President Trump, too, have leverage that demagogues who preceded them could only dream of.\n\n\nMordecai Johnson was a Black man leading an academic institution during Jim Crow when representatives from an almost entirely white Congress asked him whether professors with radical sympathies should be allowed to teach at Howard. Yet he firmly said that he would sooner shut down his university than allow anyone to dictate what its students could or could not learn. The principle at play—that without free inquiry there is no basis for a university to exist—still applies.\n\n\nUtah Lawmakers Flex Their Power Over Public Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/05/28/new-utah-law-prompts-program-cuts-strategic\n(Thanks SC for sharing and caring)\n\nPublic colleges and universities in Utah are set to lose roughly $60 million in July—or 10 percent of their state-funded instructional budgets—but they can earn back that money by cutting programs and positions and investing in other areas considered worthy by state lawmakers, under a law passed this spring.\n\n\nHB 265 is just one example of how Republicans in Utah’s State House are trying to exert more control over public higher education and shape colleges’ academic programs and services. The changes have raised concerns among faculty, who see their traditional academic freedom and shared governance roles in setting curricula and other areas being usurped.\n\n\nSince 2024, lawmakers have mandated post-tenure review; banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and offices; and banned pride flags, Juneteenth flags and others from “prominent” campus locations. They’ve also created a Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that faculty appointed to that center teach all the university’s general education courses while serving on short-term, at-will contracts.\n\n\nAs for university administrators, Gerdes [president of the University of Utah’s AAUP chapter] said, “Our administration wants to have a healthy working relationship with the State Legislature. I think that they are less concerned about having a healthy relationship with their own faculty.”\n\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune reported that university president Taylor R. Randall cited a 2024 law, Senate Bill 192, on the limits of faculty governance to silence an Academic Senate discussion in February that was critical of his provost.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nRFK Jr. says he may bar scientists from publishing in top medical journals\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/rfk-jr-ban-journals-lancet-jama/\n\n“We’re probably going to stop publishing in the Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA and those other journals because they’re all corrupt,” Kennedy said during an appearance on the “Ultimate Human” podcast. He also described the journals as being under the control of pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\nOn his plans for the department to create its own journals, Kennedy said they would “become the preeminent journals, because if you get [NIH] funding, it is anointing you as a good, legitimate scientist.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump addresses a West Point upended by his changes\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/24/trump-west-point-graduation-dei-military/\n\nHe said that as president, he had rebuilt the military “better than ever before” and rid it of “social experiments” like the teaching of critical race theory and efforts to support transgender soldiers. And he took credit for a rise in military recruitment.\n\n\n“It’s a feeling of real whiplash,” said Graham Parsons, a former West Point professor who resigned from America’s oldest service academy after publicly criticizing the impact of Trump’s policies. “We used to raise the possibility that in the military and beyond, there are still real structural problems with racism and sexism. That would not fly now.”\n\n\nNYTimes: For Trump, Civil Rights Protections Should Help White Men\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/us/politics/trump-race-civil-right-white-men.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAnd last month, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission launched an investigation at Harvard University, alleging that the school had engaged in discriminatory hiring because it showed a significant increase in the percentage of minority, female and nonbinary faculty earning tenure over the past decade while the rates for white men declined.\n\n\nConservatives have denounced disparate impact because it relies on outcome data to allege and prove discrimination — the basis on which Ms. Lucas lodged her charge against Harvard.\n\n\nHow Harmeet Dhillon is engineering a U-turn in the Justice Department’s civil-rights division\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/harmeet-dhillons-civil-rights-revolution-comes-with-tea-and-roses-ff9b1874?st=s7pVVz&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(An attempt at a flattering profile, but don’t be put led astray)\n\n“What we’re seeing now is a complete gutting of all the traditional work of the civil-rights division and then a rump of the civil-rights division being used almost exclusively to pursue right-wing Trumpist agenda items,” said Samuel Bagenstos, a former senior civil-rights official in the Obama Justice Department.\n\n\nUncle Sam’s new message to young Black Americans: I don’t want you\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/27/trump-military-hostile-black-americans/\n\nTrump and his allies have pushed aggressively to defund or eliminate DEI programs across the military. One of Trump’s first actions was to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., only the second African American ever to hold that position. Training on racial bias, cultural competency and inclusive leadership has been gutted and labeled “radical.” Officers who speak up about race or systemic injustice are accused of pushing “politics,” while those promoting exclusionary rhetoric are celebrated as patriots.\n\n\nThe message is clear: If you’re Black, Brown or anything other than the old guard — a White male — your presence in the military is conditional and increasingly unwelcome.\n\n\nThe Era of DEI for Conservatives Has Begun\n\n(Thanks BE)\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/conservative-professors-dei-initiatives/682944/?gift=yCYg0MdUGpnvquf3En3lpjtTtgMgla5OiobYjP9Hxt4&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share\n\nLegislatures in red and purple states across the country have shoveled money into universities to establish schools of civic thought, which are marketed as the conservative answer to academia’s leftward drift and the rise of identity-oriented disciplines.\n\n\nRepublicans have unfairly smeared affirmative action as a way to hire people “based on their race and not on their qualifications.” Now they’re the ones who want to hire professors based on their politics, not their fitness for the role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. has more than 1 million foreign students.

What Are the Consequences?\n\nhttps://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/trump-cancels-federal-research-grants-what-are-consequences\n\nLast August, Jaafar [professor in the math, engineering and computer science department at LaGuardia Community College] realized a long-held dream of hers to win a NSF grant: $530,002 aimed at boosting students’ success in STEM degrees (and consequently their success in New York City’s workplaces). This grant-funded work would have involved about 40 faculty members directly, plus many more through a robust diffusion model, says Jaafar, providing the kind of professional development that leads to “long-term behavioral change, so that faculty become change agents,” she said. “You go through this transformation and then you’re able to transform others.”\n\n\nOver the three years, Jaafar estimates that trained faculty would have influenced about 5,000 students at LaGuardia, a formally designated Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). “Without making these investments, we’re going to enforce the longstanding barriers to access—and we’ll actually be falling short in workforce needs,” she says.\n\n\nThese aren’t the only NSF grants to CUNY institutions that have been terminated. Indeed, about $17 million in grants have been targeted, including the following:\n\n\nA $1 million grant to Queensborough Community College, Queens College and LaGuardia to develop a program that trains students in the emerging field of wastewater-based epidemiology. The goal was to train about 200 students for public-service jobs.\n\n\nA $1 million grant to LaGuardia, City Tech, which is a 4-year college, and the biotechnology company Schrödinger to create a program that provides hands-on, experiential learning and paid internships.\n\n\nA $700,000 grant to the College of Staten Island to increase students’ sense of belonging and retention through peer-led team learning. Already, this project was achieving dramatic increases in passing rates, but because of the grant’s termination its paid peer leaders have been dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Fulbright Applicants, a DEI Disqualifier\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/us-colleges-world/2025/05/29/fulbright-applicants-rejected-over-dei-research-proposals\n\nInside Higher Ed obtained a copy of Rubio’s cable, which says that this year State Department officials would give the final sign-off; they have been tasked with rooting out any projects that could violate President Trump’s executive orders banning diversity, equity and inclusion.

But the administration holds the levers of power, and is methodically and creatively using them in a take-no-prisoners assault on the school.\n\n\n“I was dumbfounded,” Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, told me. “What’s becoming increasingly clear is that this administration will use any tool that it can.”\n\n\nMS [Michael Schmidt]: There’s been an audacity and creativity to the way that Trump has tried to use his power in the second term, and this is the latest example. Coming into this, we concentrated on his threats to lock up his enemies, like Liz Cheney or James Comey. The use of the government’s power for purely political ends has manifested itself in ways that I think go beyond what we had imagined, and even beyond what Project 2025 contemplated.\n\n\nHarvard officials have privately determined they are in a major, major, major crisis with very few, if any, good off ramps.\n\n(I hope we recognize that Harvard’s battle is the ultimate fight for academic freedom and the independence of higher education – the assault has no rational explanation; its destructiveness can’t be rationalized.)\n\nHarvard Digs In for Battle, but Trump’s Blows Are Landing\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-trump-lawsuits-fight-d5f8ec8a?st=27ignH&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nEven as Harvard looks to the courts for relief, faculty and administrators are making contingency plans and preparing for a drawn-out war with the Trump administration\n\n\nHarvard’s conundrum is that it cannot trust the Trump administration to negotiate in good faith nor can it count on winning an extended battle with the federal government, says Aziz Z. Huq, a law professor at the University of Chicago.\n\n\nThe result, Huq suggests, will be a reset not only for Harvard but across higher education. The current model for research universities was created during World War II, when the military outsourced its research and development to schools. That model served the nation well for decades but is increasingly under attack from MAGA conservatives who believe that higher education has become a hotbed of liberal ideology that needs to be torn down and rebuilt.\n\n(I’d rephrase that last part, but will amplify “That model served the nation well for decades” until the mis-informed got mid-informed.)\n\nThe government seems bent on destroying Harvard for the offense of fighting back.

Noem’s letter to Harvard makes clear that Trump and his sycophants will weaponize the state against anyone who incurs their displeasure. Courts may prevent the worst, but the whole pattern has to end if we want to have any hope of living in a country free of fear and featuring at least minimum respect for the rule of law.\n\n\nAs Harvard’s lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security rightly pointed out, Noem’s revocation fits into the Trump administration’s orgy of vengeance prompted by Harvard’s refusal to comply with evidently illegal demands issued in mid-April.\n\n\nWe can draw larger lessons from this – so far – failed attack (eight investigations, involving six different agencies, are still ongoing). One has to be ready – Harvard’s lawyers clearly were. Universities have to stand with each other; Noem warned all of them that they have to “get their act together” or else. Not least, university leaders have to explain to a larger public how Trumpists, in an unprecedented spree of national self-destruction, are busy preventing cancer cures, damaging American soft power, and killing one of the country’s major exports, namely higher education.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Attacks Have Helped Heal a Deeply Divided Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/us/trump-attacks-unify-divided-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDoes the President Want to Fix Harvard or Destroy It? by @jasonrileywsj\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/opinion/does-the-president-want-to-fix-harvard-or-destroy-it-0bf083d1?st=Ya1Vwx&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(destroy… even the WSJ recognizes this…)\n\nNYTimes: Harvard and Trump Lawyers to Face Off in Court in Foreign Student Case\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/harvard-trump-lawyers-hearing-foreign-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn the courtroom, Harvard’s strategy will use the president’s statements as evidence that the government is on a political crusade against the school.

The Trump administration is all in; is higher ed?)\n\nWhile international students make up slightly more than 5 percent of university students nationwide, some of the nation’s most selective schools rely far more heavily on them. At New York University, home to nearly 60,000 students, one-third of them are international. At Columbia, about two in five students come from abroad. And at Harvard, more than a quarter of students come from across the globe.\n\n\n“This sends a signal to the rest of the world that not only is Harvard closed to the international best and brightest, but that the U.S. is not a welcome place for international students,” Mr. Lakhani said [admissions counselor in New York].\n\n\nTrump’s war on America’s Ivy League universities didn’t start with the 2023 anti-Israel protests.

It is well worth getting past the paywall to read/)\n\nThe warlords who sacked Rome did not intend to doom Western Europe to centuries of ignorance. It was not a foreseeable consequence of their actions. The same cannot be said of the sweeping attack on human knowledge and progress that the Trump administration is now undertaking—a deliberate destruction of education, science, and history, conducted with a fanaticism that recalls the Dark Ages that followed Rome’s fall.\n\n\nEvery week brings fresh examples. The administration is threatening colleges and universities with the loss of federal funding if they do not submit to its demands, or even if they do. The engines of American scientific inquiry and ingenuity, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, are under sustained attack. Historical institutions such as the Smithsonian and artistic ones like the Kennedy Center are being converted into homes for MAGA ideology rather than historical fact and free expression. Libraries are losing funding, government-employed scientists are being dismissed from their jobs, educators are being cowed into silence, and researchers are being warned not to broach forbidden subjects. Entire databases of public-health information collected over decades are at risk of vanishing. Any facts that contradict the gospel of Trumpism are treated as heretical.\n\n\nLike the inquisitors of old, who persecuted Galileo for daring to notice that the sun did not, in fact, revolve around the Earth, they believe that truth-seeking imperils their hold on power.\n\n\nBut a massive technological stall is only the most apparent aspect of the coming damage. The attack on knowledge also threatens the country’s ability to address subtler social problems, such as racial and economic inequalities in health, opportunity, and civil rights. Research into these disparities is being cut across government and civil society in the name of defeating so-called wokeness. Invoked as a general criticism of left-wing excess, the fight against “wokeness” is destroying huge swaths of scholarship and research, for fear the results might make the case for racial or gender equality, the redistribution of wealth, or the regulation of industry.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s Politics of Plunder\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/donald-trumps-politics-of-plunder\n\nHistorically, ruling billionaires have tried to avoid such portraits. (A publicist for J. P. Morgan used to say that he was “paid to keep the bank out of the press.”) But the Trump Presidency has embraced an unusually open marriage of politics and profit. Official filings revealed that his Inauguration fund set a new record by collecting some two hundred and fifty million dollars from corporations, C.E.O.s, and other large donors. The biggest donation, five million dollars, came from a major poultry producer called Pilgrim’s Pride. A few months later, Trump’s Agriculture Secretary delighted the industry by agreeing not to increase salmonella testing and promising to cut “unnecessary bureaucracy.” By then, Trump had already fired the director of the Office of Government Ethics and the head of the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates whistle-blower complaints.\n\n\non-one conversations with the President have become available for five million. The return on investment is uncertain, a government-affairs executive told me: “What if he’s in a bad mood? You have no clue where the money is eventually going.” Another lobbying veteran described the frank exchange as “outer-borough Mafia shit.”\n\n\nThe ultra-rich have captured more of America’s wealth than even the nineteenth-century tycoons of the Gilded Age. Scholars who study inequality as far back as the Neolithic period struggle to find precedents. Tim Kerig, an archeologist who directs the Museum Alzey, in Germany, told me, “The people who built the Egyptian pyramids were probably in a less unequal society.” He suggested that today’s richest people are simply accumulating too much wealth for the system to contain. “The economic and technical evolution is much faster than the social, mental, and ideological evolution,” he said. “We had no time to adapt to all those billionaires.”\n\n\nFor fifteen years, the Patriotic Millionaires have waged an earnest battle to persuade wealthy people to lobby for higher taxes on themselves. This has often been a lonesome endeavor, but Trump’s assault on democracy, financed by some of America’s richest people, has fortified the group’s arguments. Scott Ellis, a member who used to run a consulting group at Hewlett-Packard, told me that even skeptical peers in Silicon Valley had become increasingly receptive. “Some friends used to humor me, but they’re listening more,” he said.\n\n\nIn the 2004 election, according to Americans for Tax Fairness, billionaires gave thirteen million dollars in political contributions; twenty years later, the country’s richest families spent more than two hundred times that much. Payne told the crowd, “There’s a point where money is no longer money. It is power—and they’re using that power to screw life up for everybody else.”",

    "text": "Texas House OKs more state oversight of public universities | The Texas Tribune\n\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/24/texas-governing-boards-regents-senate-bill-37/\n\nSenate Bill 37 passed in an 83-53 vote Saturday. It would create a state-level committee that would recommend courses that should be required for graduation and how to condense the number of those courses. Meanwhile, each public university system’s board of regents, who oversee the school’s operations and are appointed by the governor, would be charged with creating a committee to review curricula and reject any course deemed ideologically charged or that doesn’t align with the workforce demands. Specifically, the committees would ensure curricula do not “advocate or promote that any race, sex, ethnicity or religious belief is inherently superior to any other.”\n\n(This bill if passed is much more than a glancing blow to higher education’s principles.)\n\nIn Defense of Academic Freedom - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/05/in-defense-of-academic-freedom/682914/\n\nWhy defend academic freedom even when the ideas in question are wrongheaded or harmful? “It is precisely because any kind of purge opens the gate to all kinds of purge, that freedom of thought necessarily means the freedom to think bad thoughts as well as good.”\n\n\nThose words, written in 1953 by Joseph Alsop, an alumnus of Harvard who later served on its Board of Overseers, are relevant today, as the Trump administration cancels the visas of foreign students for viewpoints that it deems “bad.” And they were relevant in recent years as institutions of higher education investigated and disciplined members of their communities for expressing views that ran afoul of various progressive social-justice orthodoxies. But Alsop wrote them in response to the McCarthy era’s efforts to identify and punish Communists who were working in academia.\n\n\nA Tumultuous Spring Semester Finally Comes to a Close | The New Yorker\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/a-tumultuous-spring-semester-finally-comes-to-a-close\n\nThe biggest mistake that some universities have made is to presume that the White House is operating in good faith. It is not.\n\n\nAcademic freedom in the United States has found itself periodically under siege. In March, Ellen Schrecker, a historian and the author of “No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities,” spoke via Zoom to deans at Columbia (including myself) about government repression on college campuses in the nineteen-fifties. Schrecker, who has taught at both Columbia and Harvard and retired as a professor at Yeshiva University, emphasized the severity of the current climate. “I’ve studied McCarthyism’s impact on higher education for fifty years,” she said. “What’s happening now is worse.” This is in part because universities today are far more beholden to the federal government. The explosive expansion of higher education that began after the Second World War was underwritten by federal dollars. So members of Congress, and President Trump, too, have leverage that demagogues who preceded them could only dream of.\n\n\nMordecai Johnson was a Black man leading an academic institution during Jim Crow when representatives from an almost entirely white Congress asked him whether professors with radical sympathies should be allowed to teach at Howard. Yet he firmly said that he would sooner shut down his university than allow anyone to dictate what its students could or could not learn. The principle at play—that without free inquiry there is no basis for a university to exist—still applies.\n\n\nUtah Lawmakers Flex Their Power Over Public Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/05/28/new-utah-law-prompts-program-cuts-strategic\n(Thanks SC for sharing and caring)\n\nPublic colleges and universities in Utah are set to lose roughly $60 million in July—or 10 percent of their state-funded instructional budgets—but they can earn back that money by cutting programs and positions and investing in other areas considered worthy by state lawmakers, under a law passed this spring.\n\n\nHB 265 is just one example of how Republicans in Utah’s State House are trying to exert more control over public higher education and shape colleges’ academic programs and services. The changes have raised concerns among faculty, who see their traditional academic freedom and shared governance roles in setting curricula and other areas being usurped.\n\n\nSince 2024, lawmakers have mandated post-tenure review; banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and offices; and banned pride flags, Juneteenth flags and others from “prominent” campus locations. They’ve also created a Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that faculty appointed to that center teach all the university’s general education courses while serving on short-term, at-will contracts.\n\n\nAs for university administrators, Gerdes [president of the University of Utah’s AAUP chapter] said, “Our administration wants to have a healthy working relationship with the State Legislature. I think that they are less concerned about having a healthy relationship with their own faculty.”\n\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune reported that university president Taylor R. Randall cited a 2024 law, Senate Bill 192, on the limits of faculty governance to silence an Academic Senate discussion in February that was critical of his provost.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nRFK Jr. says he may bar scientists from publishing in top medical journals\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/rfk-jr-ban-journals-lancet-jama/\n\n“We’re probably going to stop publishing in the Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA and those other journals because they’re all corrupt,” Kennedy said during an appearance on the “Ultimate Human” podcast. He also described the journals as being under the control of pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\nOn his plans for the department to create its own journals, Kennedy said they would “become the preeminent journals, because if you get [NIH] funding, it is anointing you as a good, legitimate scientist.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump addresses a West Point upended by his changes\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/24/trump-west-point-graduation-dei-military/\n\nHe said that as president, he had rebuilt the military “better than ever before” and rid it of “social experiments” like the teaching of critical race theory and efforts to support transgender soldiers. And he took credit for a rise in military recruitment.\n\n\n“It’s a feeling of real whiplash,” said Graham Parsons, a former West Point professor who resigned from America’s oldest service academy after publicly criticizing the impact of Trump’s policies. “We used to raise the possibility that in the military and beyond, there are still real structural problems with racism and sexism. That would not fly now.”\n\n\nNYTimes: For Trump, Civil Rights Protections Should Help White Men\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/us/politics/trump-race-civil-right-white-men.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAnd last month, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission launched an investigation at Harvard University, alleging that the school had engaged in discriminatory hiring because it showed a significant increase in the percentage of minority, female and nonbinary faculty earning tenure over the past decade while the rates for white men declined.\n\n\nConservatives have denounced disparate impact because it relies on outcome data to allege and prove discrimination — the basis on which Ms. Lucas lodged her charge against Harvard.\n\n\nHow Harmeet Dhillon is engineering a U-turn in the Justice Department’s civil-rights division\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/harmeet-dhillons-civil-rights-revolution-comes-with-tea-and-roses-ff9b1874?st=s7pVVz&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(An attempt at a flattering profile, but don’t be put led astray)\n\n“What we’re seeing now is a complete gutting of all the traditional work of the civil-rights division and then a rump of the civil-rights division being used almost exclusively to pursue right-wing Trumpist agenda items,” said Samuel Bagenstos, a former senior civil-rights official in the Obama Justice Department.\n\n\nUncle Sam’s new message to young Black Americans: I don’t want you\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/27/trump-military-hostile-black-americans/\n\nTrump and his allies have pushed aggressively to defund or eliminate DEI programs across the military. One of Trump’s first actions was to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., only the second African American ever to hold that position. Training on racial bias, cultural competency and inclusive leadership has been gutted and labeled “radical.” Officers who speak up about race or systemic injustice are accused of pushing “politics,” while those promoting exclusionary rhetoric are celebrated as patriots.\n\n\nThe message is clear: If you’re Black, Brown or anything other than the old guard — a White male — your presence in the military is conditional and increasingly unwelcome.\n\n\nThe Era of DEI for Conservatives Has Begun\n\n(Thanks BE)\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/conservative-professors-dei-initiatives/682944/?gift=yCYg0MdUGpnvquf3En3lpjtTtgMgla5OiobYjP9Hxt4&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share\n\nLegislatures in red and purple states across the country have shoveled money into universities to establish schools of civic thought, which are marketed as the conservative answer to academia’s leftward drift and the rise of identity-oriented disciplines.\n\n\nRepublicans have unfairly smeared affirmative action as a way to hire people “based on their race and not on their qualifications.” Now they’re the ones who want to hire professors based on their politics, not their fitness for the role.",

What Are the Consequences?\n\nhttps://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/trump-cancels-federal-research-grants-what-are-consequences\n\nLast August, Jaafar [professor in the math, engineering and computer science department at LaGuardia Community College] realized a long-held dream of hers to win a NSF grant: $530,002 aimed at boosting students’ success in STEM degrees (and consequently their success in New York City’s workplaces). This grant-funded work would have involved about 40 faculty members directly, plus many more through a robust diffusion model, says Jaafar, providing the kind of professional development that leads to “long-term behavioral change, so that faculty become change agents,” she said. “You go through this transformation and then you’re able to transform others.”\n\n\nOver the three years, Jaafar estimates that trained faculty would have influenced about 5,000 students at LaGuardia, a formally designated Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). “Without making these investments, we’re going to enforce the longstanding barriers to access—and we’ll actually be falling short in workforce needs,” she says.\n\n\nThese aren’t the only NSF grants to CUNY institutions that have been terminated. Indeed, about $17 million in grants have been targeted, including the following:\n\n\nA $1 million grant to Queensborough Community College, Queens College and LaGuardia to develop a program that trains students in the emerging field of wastewater-based epidemiology. The goal was to train about 200 students for public-service jobs.\n\n\nA $1 million grant to LaGuardia, City Tech, which is a 4-year college, and the biotechnology company Schrödinger to create a program that provides hands-on, experiential learning and paid internships.\n\n\nA $700,000 grant to the College of Staten Island to increase students’ sense of belonging and retention through peer-led team learning. Already, this project was achieving dramatic increases in passing rates, but because of the grant’s termination its paid peer leaders have been dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Fulbright Applicants, a DEI Disqualifier\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/us-colleges-world/2025/05/29/fulbright-applicants-rejected-over-dei-research-proposals\n\nInside Higher Ed obtained a copy of Rubio’s cable, which says that this year State Department officials would give the final sign-off; they have been tasked with rooting out any projects that could violate President Trump’s executive orders banning diversity, equity and inclusion.

But the administration holds the levers of power, and is methodically and creatively using them in a take-no-prisoners assault on the school.\n\n\n“I was dumbfounded,” Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, told me. “What’s becoming increasingly clear is that this administration will use any tool that it can.”\n\n\nMS [Michael Schmidt]: There’s been an audacity and creativity to the way that Trump has tried to use his power in the second term, and this is the latest example. Coming into this, we concentrated on his threats to lock up his enemies, like Liz Cheney or James Comey. The use of the government’s power for purely political ends has manifested itself in ways that I think go beyond what we had imagined, and even beyond what Project 2025 contemplated.\n\n\nHarvard officials have privately determined they are in a major, major, major crisis with very few, if any, good off ramps.\n\n(I hope we recognize that Harvard’s battle is the ultimate fight for academic freedom and the independence of higher education – the assault has no rational explanation; its destructiveness can’t be rationalized.)\n\nHarvard Digs In for Battle, but Trump’s Blows Are Landing\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-trump-lawsuits-fight-d5f8ec8a?st=27ignH&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nEven as Harvard looks to the courts for relief, faculty and administrators are making contingency plans and preparing for a drawn-out war with the Trump administration\n\n\nHarvard’s conundrum is that it cannot trust the Trump administration to negotiate in good faith nor can it count on winning an extended battle with the federal government, says Aziz Z. Huq, a law professor at the University of Chicago.\n\n\nThe result, Huq suggests, will be a reset not only for Harvard but across higher education. The current model for research universities was created during World War II, when the military outsourced its research and development to schools. That model served the nation well for decades but is increasingly under attack from MAGA conservatives who believe that higher education has become a hotbed of liberal ideology that needs to be torn down and rebuilt.\n\n(I’d rephrase that last part, but will amplify “That model served the nation well for decades” until the mis-informed got mid-informed.)\n\nThe government seems bent on destroying Harvard for the offense of fighting back. And for what purpose?\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-harvard-dhs-foreign-students-kristi-noem-b8ac80ed?st=WwQp8f&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(After some back and forth, this line still hits:)\n\nThe Trump Administration seems to think it needs to destroy Harvard to save it. This is the opposite of making America great.\n\n\nPresident Trump on Monday said he was considering taking billions in grant money away from Harvard University and redistributing it to trade schools across the U.S.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-threatens-to-redistribute-3-billion-in-harvard-grants-to-trade-schools-a4ebc64c?st=XiKVT4&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(rewrite?

Noem’s letter to Harvard makes clear that Trump and his sycophants will weaponize the state against anyone who incurs their displeasure. Courts may prevent the worst, but the whole pattern has to end if we want to have any hope of living in a country free of fear and featuring at least minimum respect for the rule of law.\n\n\nAs Harvard’s lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security rightly pointed out, Noem’s revocation fits into the Trump administration’s orgy of vengeance prompted by Harvard’s refusal to comply with evidently illegal demands issued in mid-April.\n\n\nWe can draw larger lessons from this – so far – failed attack (eight investigations, involving six different agencies, are still ongoing). One has to be ready – Harvard’s lawyers clearly were. Universities have to stand with each other; Noem warned all of them that they have to “get their act together” or else. Not least, university leaders have to explain to a larger public how Trumpists, in an unprecedented spree of national self-destruction, are busy preventing cancer cures, damaging American soft power, and killing one of the country’s major exports, namely higher education.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Attacks Have Helped Heal a Deeply Divided Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/us/trump-attacks-unify-divided-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDoes the President Want to Fix Harvard or Destroy It? by @jasonrileywsj\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/opinion/does-the-president-want-to-fix-harvard-or-destroy-it-0bf083d1?st=Ya1Vwx&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(destroy… even the WSJ recognizes this…)\n\nNYTimes: Harvard and Trump Lawyers to Face Off in Court in Foreign Student Case\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/harvard-trump-lawyers-hearing-foreign-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn the courtroom, Harvard’s strategy will use the president’s statements as evidence that the government is on a political crusade against the school. In briefs filed in the case, lawyers have argued Trump administration officials have unjustly singled out the university for punishment, violating its First Amendment rights. It has included the president’s aggressive comments as exhibits in its case.\n\n\nA visa ban would affect 7,000 students at Harvard. That includes 5,000 current students and another 2,000 in a program that allows students to stay and work for up to three years after they graduate.\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Says Many of Its Foreign Students Are Seeking to Transfer\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/harvard-international-students-transfers.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration’s efforts to halt Harvard University’s ability to enroll international students has sown “profound fear, concern, and confusion,” the university’s director of immigration services said in a court filing on Wednesday.\n\n\nCountless international students have asked about transferring, the director, Maureen Martin, wrote in the filing.\n\n\nNYTimes: Live Updates: Judge Will Block Trump From Barring Foreign Students at Harvard, For Now\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/29/us/harvard-trump?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: What to Know About Trump Officials’ Latest Move Against Columbia\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/nyregion/columbia-trump-jewish-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe move on Thursday appeared to reflect the administration’s unusual approach to slashing federal funding to colleges.\n\n\nHistorically, such cancellations would follow a lengthy review process. But, legal experts said, the Trump administration has not always adhered to standard procedure, taking swift action against universities’ finances and sometimes notifying news outlets before campus leaders.\n\n(Id est: sanewashing.)\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Fight Illustrates Trump’s Worldview: If He Attacks, It’s Your Fault\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/harvard-university-trump-administration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe “last thing” he [large, orange hair] wants to do is harm the storied jewel of American higher education, he said. But he had no choice. The university was fighting back.\n\n(By personalizing the battle, perhaps the wider assault goes unnoticed)\n\nIt’s a constant in Mr. Trump’s worldview: If he goes after someone or something, it is their fault, not his. They are responsible for his actions. Not him.\n\n\nA federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration’s efforts to deport Columbia University demonstrator Mahmoud Khalil were likely unconstitutional\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/mahmoud-khalil-deportation-unconstitutional-judge-194a0d4a?st=2MPd18&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Universities See Trump’s Harvard Move as a Threat to Them, Too\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/us/harvard-trump-international-students-impact.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMore than 5,000 miles away, Wendy Hensel, the president of the University of Hawaii, said that it was “reverberating across higher education.”\n\n(Had to add this quote, as I miss our old provost.)\n\nTo many academics, that was a clear signal that Mr. Trump was prepared to use any federal mechanism as leverage if he did not get what he wants.\n\n\n“While Harvard is the victim of the moment, it’s a warning and unprecedented attempt of a hostile federal government to erode the autonomy of all major universities in the U.S.,” said John Aubrey Douglass, a senior research fellow at the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n(Again, this week’s them. The Trump administration is all in; is higher ed?)\n\nWhile international students make up slightly more than 5 percent of university students nationwide, some of the nation’s most selective schools rely far more heavily on them. At New York University, home to nearly 60,000 students, one-third of them are international. At Columbia, about two in five students come from abroad. And at Harvard, more than a quarter of students come from across the globe.\n\n\n“This sends a signal to the rest of the world that not only is Harvard closed to the international best and brightest, but that the U.S. is not a welcome place for international students,” Mr. Lakhani said [admissions counselor in New York].\n\n\nTrump’s war on America’s Ivy League universities didn’t start with the 2023 anti-Israel protests. It was set off in 2019 by a sucker punch that left a man with a black eye.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-college-university-federal-funding-fight-91c2a274?st=4xm3Hq&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(I’m sure this rationale was used by the Project 2025 authors…)",

It’s emboldened a lot of political leaders to feel they can make inroads by silencing faculty in other areas,” Michelle Lacey, a math professor and president of Tulane’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, told Inside Higher Ed. “That was the catalyst for creating a climate where university administrators are very nervous, especially now as we see the government pulling funding for areas of research they don’t like.”\n\n\nLast summer, he [Governor Landry, Trump aligned[ enacted a law that allows him to directly appoint board chairs at the state’s public colleges and universities. And in November, following Trump’s election, Landry publicly called on officials at Louisiana State University to punish a law professor who allegedly made brief comments in class about students who voted for the president.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Is Replacing DEI?

The ostensible reason offered is so that State Department officials can conduct additional vetting of visas applicants, by reviewing their social media accounts. According to reports, the cable reads: “Effective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consular sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor (F, M, and J) visa appointment capacity until further guidance is issued [in a separate, forthcoming telegram], which we anticipate in the coming days.”\n\n\nState Dept. restarts student visa interviews with tougher social media rules\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/18/student-visas-social-media-vetting-state-department/\n\nAs staff members examine students’ profiles, the cable instructed, they must look to “identify applicants who bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles; who advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists and other threats to U.S. national security; or who perpetrate unlawful antisemitic harassment or violence.”\n\n\nOne State department official noted that the agency issued 446,000 student visas in 2023. “If everyone has to now have their social media scrubbed for derogatory information?

The lawsuit, which names Democratic governor Andy Beshear, Commissioner of Education Robbie Fletcher and the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education, takes issue with a policy that allows graduates of Kentucky high schools who live in the state, regardless of citizenship, to access in-state tuition benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Universities Would Overhaul Research Funding\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/18/university-leaders-weigh-changes-research\n\nNow, after just over six weeks of work, that group known as the Joint Associations Group is homing in on a plan to rework how the government funds research, and they want feedback from the university research community before they present a proposal to Congress and the Trump administration at the end of the month.\n\n\n“Unfortunately, something is going to change,” said Barbara Snyder, president of the Association of American Universities. “Either we will be part of it or it will be imposed upon us … Significant division in the research community is going to kill us.”\n\n\nBoth versions of what JAG is calling the Fiscal Accountability in Research model, or FAIR, are geared toward offering more accountability and transparency about how federal research dollars are spent. JAG hopes that in the end, the new model will be simpler than the current one. They also want to nix terms like “indirect costs rate” and “overhead” for either essential research support or general research operations in an effort to underscore that the money goes toward the real costs of research.\n\n\nOne model, which the group calls FAIR No. 1, would include costs related to managing the grant, general research operations and facilities as a fixed percentage of the total budget. The percentage would be based in part on the type of institution and research. This approach is designed to be simple and reasonable, according to the group’s presentation, but it’s more general, which makes it “difficult to account for the wide array of research frameworks that now exist.”\n\n\nThe other model, FAIR No. 2, would more accurately reflect the actual costs of a project and make the structure for federal grants more like those from private foundations. Under this model, essential research support would be lumped into the project costs while funding for general research operations, such as payroll and procurement, would be a fixed percentage of the total budget. That change would likely increase the direct costs of the project.\n\n\nResearch Grants Increasingly Require Compliance With Trump’s Orders. Here’s How Colleges Are Responding.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/research-grants-increasingly-require-compliance-with-trumps-orders-heres-how-colleges-are-responding\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the conditions for accepting federal funding have become increasingly partisan. The Chronicle first reported in May that at least two notice-of-award letters from the National Institutes of Health, which are legal documents spelling out the terms of grants, mandated compliance with Trump’s executive order recognizing only two sexes, effectively excluding transgender people from U.S. policy.\n\n\nNow, according to scientists and colleges contacted by The Chronicle, an increasing number of grant letters — from the NIH and other agencies — require compliance with one or more of Trump’s executive orders and with civil-rights laws, which Trump has sought to reinterpret.\n\n\nIn one striking example of the ever-changing environment, the NIH announced a policy in April that required grantees to attest that they don’t operate “illegal” diversity, equity, and inclusion programs or support boycotts of Israel when accepting federal funds. But over the past week, the policy was abruptly rescinded, then put back in place, then rescinded again without explanation.\n\n\nA federal judge announced a short-term win for scientists on Monday, ruling that Trump’s termination of hundreds of grants because they referenced DEI or LGBTQ issues was discriminatory, and ordering the government to restore the funding.\n\n\nHow Senate Republicans Want to Hold Colleges Accountable\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/06/20/how-senate-republicans-want-hold-colleges-accountable\n\nThe high chamber’s proposal, which ties a university’s access to federal loans to how much their students earn after graduation, is simpler and more productive than the House proposal, known as risk-sharing, which would require colleges to pay an annual penalty based on their students’ outstanding loan balances, they say.\n\n\nThe Senate plan seems to be based on an existing regulation known as gainful employment, which uses students’ earnings and debt to measure whether for-profit and non-degree programs adequately prepare their students for the workforce. But Republicans who sponsored the bill and expanded its reach to all degree programs have been wary of drawing attention to the overlap, as lawmakers have avoided calling it anything like “gainful employment 2.0” or “gainful for all.”\n\n\nRepublicans have historically opposed the Democratic policy, which was first put in place during the Obama administration, saying it unfairly targeted for-profit programs and that a free market would be the best way to regulate the quality of academic programs.\n\n\nCongressional Republicans Want to End Grad PLUS Loans. How Might It Affect Your Campus?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/congressional-republicans-want-to-end-grad-plus-loans-how-might-it-affect-your-campus\n\nCongressional Republicans appear set to effectively shut down the 20-year-old Grad PLUS federal student-loan program as House and Senate lawmakers seek passage of a sprawling set of budget cuts, tax adjustments, and policy changes — bundled together and branded by President Trump as the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n\nwould see the Grad PLUS loan program, which had been expected to lend out roughly $19 billion annually between 2026-34, phased out for new borrowers starting in the 2026-27 academic year.

Here’s why that’s dangerous.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/18/trump-science-attacks-internet/\n\nThe evisceration of the National Science Foundation (NSF) — including wholesale firings, budget-slashing and arbitrary elimination of grants — is especially worrisome to those of us who understand the crucial role science has played in making America a great and powerful nation. Congress must act soon to halt this devastating attack.\n\n\nAt its heart was a management ethos borrowed from successful wartime research: the idea that knowledgeable scientists could identify the most fruitful topics and the best ways to pursue them. T\n\n\nIn the past, the NSF has usually enjoyed bipartisan support from both presidents and members of Congress. But the ravages currently being inflicted upon the agency may bring a truly golden era of American science to a halt. The February dismissal of 168 “probationary” NSF employees included career scientists newly arrived from academic positions to work as program managers familiar with the scientific disciplines they were to oversee. Though some have been reinstated by court order, the chilling uncertainty this ill-considered action instills in the NSF workforce and its grantees can seriously harm U.S. science.\n\n\nWhat’s worse, the 2026 fiscal year Trump budget calls for slashing $5 billion from the current $9 billion NSF budget. That would be the death knell of the storied agency as it has been known for decades\n\n\n\n\n\ntracking site\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda#research\n\nThe Scientific Research Lost Amid the Trump Administration’s NIH Cuts — ProPublica\n\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/nih-cuts-research-lost-trump/\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is responsible for more than 80% of the world’s grant investment in biomedical research. Its funding has sparked countless medical breakthroughs — on cancer, diabetes, strokes — and plays a fundamental role in the development of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n\nThe NIH has rarely revoked funding once it has been awarded. Out of the tens of thousands of grants overseen by the institution since 2012, it terminated fewer than five for violations of the agency’s terms and conditions.\n\n\nThen Donald Trump was reelected.\n\n\nSince his January inauguration, his administration has terminated more than 1,450 grants, withholding more than $750 million in funds; officials have said they are curbing wasteful spending and “unscientific” research.\n\n\nThe mass cancellation of grants in response to political policy shifts has no precedent, former and current NIH officials told ProPublica. It threatens the stability of the institution and the scientific enterprise of the nation at large.\n\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the toll, ProPublica reached out to more than 500 researchers, scientists and investigators whose grants were terminated. More than 150 responded to share their experiences, which reveal consequences that experts say run counter to scientific logic and even common sense.\n\n(Well worth reading to gain a sense of scale of this sabotage)\n\nTrump’s NIH Axed Research Grants Despite Court Order — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/trump-nih-cuts-transgender-research-grants\n(And more details on sabotage at the NIH)\n\nNearly two weeks after the court’s preliminary injunction was issued, the National Institutes of Health’s then-acting head, Dr. Matthew J. Memoli, drafted a memo that details how the agency, in response to Trump’s executive orders, cut funding for research grants that “promote or inculcate gender ideology.” An internal spreadsheet of terminated NIH grants also references “gender ideology” and lists the number associated with Trump’s executive order as the reason for the termination of more than a half dozen research grants. [Yet, “Lawyers for the federal government have repeatedly claimed in court filings that the administration has been complying with the order (stopping it from cutting funding related to gender identity and the provision of gender-affirming care in response to President Donald Trump’s executive orders)”]\n\n\nThe Washington attorney general’s allegation that the Trump administration violated a court order comes as the country lurches toward a constitutional crisis amid accusations that the executive branch has defied or ignored court orders in several other cases.\n\n\nin depositions filed in the case last week, two NIH officials testified that DOGE itself gave directions in hundreds of grant terminations.\n\n\nThe lawsuit offers an unprecedented view into the termination of more than 600 grants at the NIH over the past two months. Many of the canceled grants appear to have focused on subjects that the administration claims are unscientific or that the agency should no longer focus on under new priorities, such as gender identity, vaccine hesitancy and diversity, equity and inclusion. Grants related to research in China have also been cut, and climate change projects are under scrutiny.\n\n\nMike Faulk, the deputy communications director for the Washington state attorney general’s office, told ProPublica in an email that the administration “appears to have used DOGE in this instance to keep career NIH officials in the dark about what was happening and why.” “While claiming to be transparent, DOGE has actively hidden its activities and its true motivations,” he said.\n\n\n“Their claim to have complied with the preliminary injunction is almost laughable,” said Faulk, the office’s deputy communications director. “The Trump administration is playing games with no apparent respect for the rule of law.”\n\n\nThe executive order detailing DOGE’s responsibilities describes the cost-cutting team as advisers that consult agency heads on the termination of contracts and grants. No language in the orders gives the DOGE team members the authority to direct the cancellation of grants or contracts. However, the depositions portray Riley [former consultant for McKinsey & Co. and DOGE member] as giving directions on how to conduct the terminations.\n\n\nJeremy Berg, who led the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the NIH from 2003 to 2011, told ProPublica that the administration’s assessment of the institution was “not fair and not based on any substantial analysis or evidence,” and the proposed cuts “would be absolutely devastating to NIH and to biomedical research in the United States.”\n\n\nJudge Rejects Trump’s ‘Appalling’ NIH LGBTQ, Race Grant Cuts\n\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/judge-clashes-with-trump-justice-department-over-nih-grant-cuts\n(Thanks KB)\n\n“This represents racial discrimination and discrimination against America’s LGBTQ community.

A hearing in the case is set for July 2.\n\n\nFor example, Johns Hopkins and the DOD currently have in place a negotiated indirect cost rate of 55 percent. In 2024 JHU received $32 million from the DOD to cover indirect costs, according to the lawsuit.

Now, obscured by the turmoil of the many other challenges to higher education since the start of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, tenure has come under siege in states across the country.\n\n\n“It’s the flip side of the same assault,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, or AFT, which represents 400,000 faculty and other university and college employees. “Some of the assault is coming from taking away grants, and some of the assault is coming by taking away tenure.”\n\n(But it doesn’t seem to be driven by a newly appointed leader)\n\n“To me, it’s about the Senate wanting control over the university,” said Christian Fern, executive director of the University of Hawai‘i Professional Assembly, the faculty union.\n\n(States mentioned: Hawaii, Nebraska, Ohio, Kentucky, Texas, Indiana, Arkansas, North Dakota, Kansas)\n\n“This level of attack couldn’t gain the kind of momentum it has without the declining public support for higher education,” Reuben [Harvard historian] said. “It couldn’t have happened to this magnitude before, because there was a general sense that higher education was good for society.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Will Ask a Judge to Block Trump From Barring International Students\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/us/harvard-international-students-lawsuit-injunction.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe hearing follows at least four different attempts by Trump administration officials to end or limit Harvard’s foreign enrollment. If they succeed, it could affect about 7,000 international scholars and potentially deliver a disabling blow to the campus’s finances, curriculum and identity.\n\n\nIn their court filing, Harvard’s lawyers argued that broad language was necessary because the government had “committed to continuing — indeed to intensifying — its retaliatory campaign,” one that can “throw Harvard and its international community into turmoil.”\n\n\nThe litigation, which is one of two cases Harvard has filed against the Trump administration, began last month when the Department of Homeland Security said it was revoking Harvard’s ability to host students under a system called the Student Exchange and Visitor Program.\n\n\nA lawyer for Harvard, Ian Gershengorn, accused the administration of resorting to “shenanigans” in its efforts to bar foreign students from Harvard.\n\n\nHarvard has said the actions aren’t grounded in real violations but instead are retaliation for its refusal to bend to the administration’s will.\n\n\nJudge Waits to Rule on Trump’s Effort to Bar Harvard Foreign Students\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/17/judge-delays-ruling-trump-ban-harvard-foreign\n\nIn a hearing on Monday, a federal judge put off making a ruling on whether to continue blocking President Trump’s proclamation banning Harvard international students and researchers from entering the country.

While opponents of the Trump administration’s crackdown have lauded Harvard for standing its ground, it is far from clear which school will be better off in the long run. And the question remains whether Columbia’s path can offer a road map for other universities attacked by the president.\n\n\nStill, the federal Department of Education threatened Columbia’s accreditation in early June, saying that in its eyes, the school was no longer meeting the standards necessary for the key credential, alleging it had “acted with deliberate indifference” toward the harassment of Jewish students.\n\n\n“There is a basic principle of academic freedom that is under attack, but I still believe in it,” he said. “And I think everybody in this department believes in it.

Researchers and administrators now worry this stopgap can’t last.\n\n\n“The university is totally keeping us on life support,” said Dr. Daniela Matei, a Northwestern oncologist. “The big question is for how long they can do this.”\n\n\nThe sudden collapse of the once-symbiotic relationship between the federal government and higher education is torpedoing a half-century-old university business model and upending how science is done.\n\n\nIt’s a complete turnaround for today’s university researchers, for whom federal funding—from NIH, National Science Foundation, and other agencies—has never been in question. Billions of dollars have flowed annually to universities through competitive grants, funding basic research that can lead to cutting-edge medicine and technological innovations.\n\n\nAt places like Harvard and Columbia, funding cuts or freezes have come with lists of demands spanning changes to admissions and faculty hiring.\n\n\nAt others, like Northwestern, the path to restoration is less clear. In April, a Trump administration official told media that $790 million in federal funds to the Illinois university would be frozen, but that number has never been detailed or communicated directly to school officials, a school spokesman said. Nor has Trump told the university what they can do to get the money returned, the spokesman said, though the school’s president has met with Trump’s education secretary to discuss the situation on campus.\n\n\nUniversity officials say bills to NIH have simply gone unpaid. NIH grant officers in April were told not to communicate with Northwestern and other affected universities about the freeze, according to an email viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Northwestern researchers have had grants terminated or frozen from multiple agencies, the university said.\n\n\nFacing Research Cuts, Officials at U. of Iowa Spoke of a ‘Limited Ability to Publicly Fight This’\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/facing-research-cuts-officials-at-u-of-iowa-spoke-of-a-limited-ability-to-publicly-fight-this\n\nAsked by a faculty member what he and his peers could do to help, the University of Iowa’s interim vice president for research suggested only “acting as a private citizen to call our legislators and tell them what a bad idea this is (from your own phone or using your own email).” The campus’s location in a solidly red state hindered it from fighting the policy change, Lois J.

Starting next semester, she’s planning to have her students write their responses in class to deter the use of AI—and she’s even considering requiring them to write the answers out by hand.\n\n\nYour Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1\n\nWith today’s wide adoption of LLM products like ChatGPT from OpenAI, humans and businesses engage and use LLMs on a daily basis. Like any other tool, it carries its own set of advantages and limitations. This study focuses on finding out the cognitive cost of using an LLM in the educational context of writing an essay.\n\n\nAs the educational impact of LLM use only begins to settle with the general population, in this study we demonstrate the pressing matter of a likely decrease in learning skills based on the results of our study. The use of LLM had a measurable impact on participants, and while the benefits were initially apparent, as we demonstrated over the course of 4 months, the LLM group’s participants performed worse than their counterparts in the Brain-only group at all levels: neural, linguistic, scoring.\n\n\nWhat Will Be Left of Higher Ed in Four Years?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-will-be-left-of-higher-ed-in-four-years\n\nA recent report from the consulting firm Deloitte confirms what everyone working in higher education already knows: Donald Trump “brings a layer of complexity to questions of financial sustainability for colleges and universities.” The administration’s dizzying range of punitive measures for academe comes at an inconvenient time: Our institutions are already grappling with diminished state support and a looming demographic cliff.\n\n\nResearch universities face the greatest financial pressure. Grant cancellations and planned cuts to the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health are creating enormous budgetary holes: The budgets for graduate programs and scientific-research staffing were developed on the assumption that federal funding was a constant.\n\n\nIn red states like Florida, Indiana, and Texas, Trump-supporting Legislatures are also working to bust up faculty and administrative autonomy as a condition of public funding. The administration’s cultural agenda for higher ed is likely to be advanced most fully in states where MAGA-friendly legislatures have near-total control. This doesn’t mean blue-state public research universities are off the hook. Data shows that state financial support for higher ed has been up over the past couple of years, but we might have reached high tide. Ebbing state funding would pair dangerously with cuts to federal research.\n\n\nRegional Publics and Community Colleges\n\n\nAt first glance these institutions appear to be in an enviable position: They don’t rely heavily on federal research funding, they don’t have big endowments to tax, they don’t enroll lots of international students, and they tend to fly below the political radar. Domestic undergraduate enrollment is unlikely to collapse, and a looming economic downturn could even cause an uptick in demand for these institutions since people look to increase their skills and retrain during recessions. Still, the major financial-aid reform provisions tucked away in the “Big, Beautiful” reconciliation bill recently passed by the House will clearly affect these institutions if enacted, though in mixed ways. For community colleges, their lower tuition prices, shorter program duration, and a vocational orientation might yield comparative advantages in a world with diminished federal student aid. Risk-sharing provisions that put campuses on the hook for portions of unpaid student debt might harm minority-serving institutions and campuses that serve low-income and other students with historically higher rates of loan default. Requiring full-time enrollment for Pell Grant eligibility, as proposed in the House bill, would harm these institutions too. The Senate seems less excited about the risk-sharing and full-time Pell provisions, but the financial-aid outlook remains murky.\n\n\nRegional universities and community colleges also face enrollment risks. Pennsylvania State University plans to shutter several regional campuses, and federal pressure on research universities will have knock-on effects within state university systems. Looking to secure their own budgets, research universities might employ aggressive tactics to lure students otherwise headed to regional campuses.\n\n\nRather than forming partnerships with the federal government, colleges will now have to endure the headwinds created by federal policy and, in some cases, engage in direct confrontation with the administration. I do not believe Trump will be able to destroy American higher education, but his administration will try, and the sector will suffer. Research footprints will shrink, the number of programs and activities on offer will be reduced, and the workloads of already-overextended faculty and staff will increase. Senior administrators can’t say so, but in the next few years colleges and universities will become diminished versions of themselves. Those of us who teach or work in higher ed will watch our institutions decline.\n\n\nCampuses will look for revenue to replace federal dollars. Public research universities will increase their enrollments, often at the expense of their regional counterparts. Our wealthiest colleges may quietly roll back their need-blind admissions policies. The steady trickle of emails from university communications announcing exciting new cancer research efforts and new science facilities will slow. Departmental budgets will be slashed to the point where faculty concern is less for vanishing tenure lines than for the survival of the department itself. Teaching course loads will grow, library operational hours will shrink, and students, stung by loan restrictions and red tape, will increasingly rush from class to part-time jobs. In short, the sector will be smaller, poorer, and capable of doing fewer things.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Data Shows Attendance Fosters Student Success\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/student-success/academic-life/2025/06/13/data-shows-attendance-improves-student-success\n(Some headlines write themselves)\n\nWho’s missing class? It’s not uncommon for a student to miss class for illness or an outside conflict, but higher rates of absence among college students in recent years are giving professors pause.\n\n\nMore than 30 percent of students who attended community college in person skipped class sometimes in the past year, a 2023 study found; 4 percent said they skipped class often or very often.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

But Tulane leaders have chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.”\n\n\n“It started with the pro-Palestinian activism on our campus and others across the country. It’s emboldened a lot of political leaders to feel they can make inroads by silencing faculty in other areas,” Michelle Lacey, a math professor and president of Tulane’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, told Inside Higher Ed. “That was the catalyst for creating a climate where university administrators are very nervous, especially now as we see the government pulling funding for areas of research they don’t like.”\n\n\nLast summer, he [Governor Landry, Trump aligned[ enacted a law that allows him to directly appoint board chairs at the state’s public colleges and universities.

The ostensible reason offered is so that State Department officials can conduct additional vetting of visas applicants, by reviewing their social media accounts. According to reports, the cable reads: “Effective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consular sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor (F, M, and J) visa appointment capacity until further guidance is issued [in a separate, forthcoming telegram], which we anticipate in the coming days.”\n\n\nState Dept. restarts student visa interviews with tougher social media rules\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/18/student-visas-social-media-vetting-state-department/\n\nAs staff members examine students’ profiles, the cable instructed, they must look to “identify applicants who bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles; who advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists and other threats to U.S. national security; or who perpetrate unlawful antisemitic harassment or violence.”\n\n\nOne State department official noted that the agency issued 446,000 student visas in 2023. “If everyone has to now have their social media scrubbed for derogatory information? Officers do not have that time.”\n\n\nThe cable suggested that State Department officials should request that applicants make public and accessible all portions of their social media accounts and should penalize them if they refuse.\n\n\nIf portions of accounts remain “set to ‘private’ or otherwise limited, you should treat the case as any other where an applicant fails to provide certain information on request,” the cable stated. It added, in a bolded sentence, “You must consider whether such failure reflects evasiveness or otherwise calls into question the applicant’s credibility.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/18/social-media-screening-student-visas-00413160\n(Also)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/us/politics/student-visa-applications.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDOJ Targets In-State Tuition for Noncitizens in Kentucky as Texas Students Fight Back\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/20/after-texas-doj-targets-kentuckys-state-tuition\n\nThe Justice Department sued Kentucky politicians over in-state tuition benefits for undocumented students, just as Texas students and advocates are pushing back against a lawsuit that killed a similar state policy.\n\n\nThe department filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky on Tuesday challenging the in-state tuition policy for undocumented students. The lawsuit, which names Democratic governor Andy Beshear, Commissioner of Education Robbie Fletcher and the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education, takes issue with a policy that allows graduates of Kentucky high schools who live in the state, regardless of citizenship, to access in-state tuition benefits."

    "text": "How Universities Would Overhaul Research Funding\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/18/university-leaders-weigh-changes-research\n\nNow, after just over six weeks of work, that group known as the Joint Associations Group is homing in on a plan to rework how the government funds research, and they want feedback from the university research community before they present a proposal to Congress and the Trump administration at the end of the month.\n\n\n“Unfortunately, something is going to change,” said Barbara Snyder, president of the Association of American Universities. “Either we will be part of it or it will be imposed upon us … Significant division in the research community is going to kill us.”\n\n\nBoth versions of what JAG is calling the Fiscal Accountability in Research model, or FAIR, are geared toward offering more accountability and transparency about how federal research dollars are spent. JAG hopes that in the end, the new model will be simpler than the current one. They also want to nix terms like “indirect costs rate” and “overhead” for either essential research support or general research operations in an effort to underscore that the money goes toward the real costs of research.\n\n\nOne model, which the group calls FAIR No. 1, would include costs related to managing the grant, general research operations and facilities as a fixed percentage of the total budget. The percentage would be based in part on the type of institution and research. This approach is designed to be simple and reasonable, according to the group’s presentation, but it’s more general, which makes it “difficult to account for the wide array of research frameworks that now exist.”\n\n\nThe other model, FAIR No. 2, would more accurately reflect the actual costs of a project and make the structure for federal grants more like those from private foundations. Under this model, essential research support would be lumped into the project costs while funding for general research operations, such as payroll and procurement, would be a fixed percentage of the total budget. That change would likely increase the direct costs of the project.\n\n\nResearch Grants Increasingly Require Compliance With Trump’s Orders. Here’s How Colleges Are Responding.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/research-grants-increasingly-require-compliance-with-trumps-orders-heres-how-colleges-are-responding\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the conditions for accepting federal funding have become increasingly partisan. The Chronicle first reported in May that at least two notice-of-award letters from the National Institutes of Health, which are legal documents spelling out the terms of grants, mandated compliance with Trump’s executive order recognizing only two sexes, effectively excluding transgender people from U.S. policy.\n\n\nNow, according to scientists and colleges contacted by The Chronicle, an increasing number of grant letters — from the NIH and other agencies — require compliance with one or more of Trump’s executive orders and with civil-rights laws, which Trump has sought to reinterpret.\n\n\nIn one striking example of the ever-changing environment, the NIH announced a policy in April that required grantees to attest that they don’t operate “illegal” diversity, equity, and inclusion programs or support boycotts of Israel when accepting federal funds. But over the past week, the policy was abruptly rescinded, then put back in place, then rescinded again without explanation.\n\n\nA federal judge announced a short-term win for scientists on Monday, ruling that Trump’s termination of hundreds of grants because they referenced DEI or LGBTQ issues was discriminatory, and ordering the government to restore the funding.\n\n\nHow Senate Republicans Want to Hold Colleges Accountable\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/06/20/how-senate-republicans-want-hold-colleges-accountable\n\nThe high chamber’s proposal, which ties a university’s access to federal loans to how much their students earn after graduation, is simpler and more productive than the House proposal, known as risk-sharing, which would require colleges to pay an annual penalty based on their students’ outstanding loan balances, they say.\n\n\nThe Senate plan seems to be based on an existing regulation known as gainful employment, which uses students’ earnings and debt to measure whether for-profit and non-degree programs adequately prepare their students for the workforce. But Republicans who sponsored the bill and expanded its reach to all degree programs have been wary of drawing attention to the overlap, as lawmakers have avoided calling it anything like “gainful employment 2.0” or “gainful for all.”\n\n\nRepublicans have historically opposed the Democratic policy, which was first put in place during the Obama administration, saying it unfairly targeted for-profit programs and that a free market would be the best way to regulate the quality of academic programs.\n\n\nCongressional Republicans Want to End Grad PLUS Loans. How Might It Affect Your Campus?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/congressional-republicans-want-to-end-grad-plus-loans-how-might-it-affect-your-campus\n\nCongressional Republicans appear set to effectively shut down the 20-year-old Grad PLUS federal student-loan program as House and Senate lawmakers seek passage of a sprawling set of budget cuts, tax adjustments, and policy changes — bundled together and branded by President Trump as the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n\nwould see the Grad PLUS loan program, which had been expected to lend out roughly $19 billion annually between 2026-34, phased out for new borrowers starting in the 2026-27 academic year. The program would eventually be mothballed for all borrowers starting in the 2029-30 academic year.\n\n(The interactive table has some detail\n\n\n\nCollege\nN\nDisbursement\n\n\n\n\nCCNY\n180\n3.3M\n\n\nGC\n193\n2.6M\n\n\nHunter\n114\n1.7M\n\n\nBaruch\n79\n1.6M\n\n\n\nBrooklyn, John Jay, York, Lehman, Queens, CSI also impacted ~ 2M combined)\n\nBut without access to Grad PLUS financing, said Suzanne Ortega, president of the Council of Graduate Schools, graduate-level education will either become unattainable for some students or “force them into high-cost private debt, exacerbating the student-debt crisis and existing work-force shortages in critical fields like teaching, law enforcement, public-health professions, and engineers.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump is undermining U.S. science. Here’s why that’s dangerous.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/18/trump-science-attacks-internet/\n\nThe evisceration of the National Science Foundation (NSF) — including wholesale firings, budget-slashing and arbitrary elimination of grants — is especially worrisome to those of us who understand the crucial role science has played in making America a great and powerful nation. Congress must act soon to halt this devastating attack.\n\n\nAt its heart was a management ethos borrowed from successful wartime research: the idea that knowledgeable scientists could identify the most fruitful topics and the best ways to pursue them. T\n\n\nIn the past, the NSF has usually enjoyed bipartisan support from both presidents and members of Congress. But the ravages currently being inflicted upon the agency may bring a truly golden era of American science to a halt. The February dismissal of 168 “probationary” NSF employees included career scientists newly arrived from academic positions to work as program managers familiar with the scientific disciplines they were to oversee. Though some have been reinstated by court order, the chilling uncertainty this ill-considered action instills in the NSF workforce and its grantees can seriously harm U.S. science.\n\n\nWhat’s worse, the 2026 fiscal year Trump budget calls for slashing $5 billion from the current $9 billion NSF budget. That would be the death knell of the storied agency as it has been known for decades\n\n\n\n\n\ntracking site\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda#research\n\nThe Scientific Research Lost Amid the Trump Administration’s NIH Cuts — ProPublica\n\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/nih-cuts-research-lost-trump/\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is responsible for more than 80% of the world’s grant investment in biomedical research. Its funding has sparked countless medical breakthroughs — on cancer, diabetes, strokes — and plays a fundamental role in the development of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n\nThe NIH has rarely revoked funding once it has been awarded. Out of the tens of thousands of grants overseen by the institution since 2012, it terminated fewer than five for violations of the agency’s terms and conditions.\n\n\nThen Donald Trump was reelected.\n\n\nSince his January inauguration, his administration has terminated more than 1,450 grants, withholding more than $750 million in funds; officials have said they are curbing wasteful spending and “unscientific” research.\n\n\nThe mass cancellation of grants in response to political policy shifts has no precedent, former and current NIH officials told ProPublica. It threatens the stability of the institution and the scientific enterprise of the nation at large.\n\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the toll, ProPublica reached out to more than 500 researchers, scientists and investigators whose grants were terminated. More than 150 responded to share their experiences, which reveal consequences that experts say run counter to scientific logic and even common sense.\n\n(Well worth reading to gain a sense of scale of this sabotage)\n\nTrump’s NIH Axed Research Grants Despite Court Order — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/trump-nih-cuts-transgender-research-grants\n(And more details on sabotage at the NIH)\n\nNearly two weeks after the court’s preliminary injunction was issued, the National Institutes of Health’s then-acting head, Dr. Matthew J. Memoli, drafted a memo that details how the agency, in response to Trump’s executive orders, cut funding for research grants that “promote or inculcate gender ideology.” An internal spreadsheet of terminated NIH grants also references “gender ideology” and lists the number associated with Trump’s executive order as the reason for the termination of more than a half dozen research grants. [Yet, “Lawyers for the federal government have repeatedly claimed in court filings that the administration has been complying with the order (stopping it from cutting funding related to gender identity and the provision of gender-affirming care in response to President Donald Trump’s executive orders)”]\n\n\nThe Washington attorney general’s allegation that the Trump administration violated a court order comes as the country lurches toward a constitutional crisis amid accusations that the executive branch has defied or ignored court orders in several other cases.\n\n\nin depositions filed in the case last week, two NIH officials testified that DOGE itself gave directions in hundreds of grant terminations.\n\n\nThe lawsuit offers an unprecedented view into the termination of more than 600 grants at the NIH over the past two months. Many of the canceled grants appear to have focused on subjects that the administration claims are unscientific or that the agency should no longer focus on under new priorities, such as gender identity, vaccine hesitancy and diversity, equity and inclusion. Grants related to research in China have also been cut, and climate change projects are under scrutiny.\n\n\nMike Faulk, the deputy communications director for the Washington state attorney general’s office, told ProPublica in an email that the administration “appears to have used DOGE in this instance to keep career NIH officials in the dark about what was happening and why.” “While claiming to be transparent, DOGE has actively hidden its activities and its true motivations,” he said.\n\n\n“Their claim to have complied with the preliminary injunction is almost laughable,” said Faulk, the office’s deputy communications director. “The Trump administration is playing games with no apparent respect for the rule of law.”\n\n\nThe executive order detailing DOGE’s responsibilities describes the cost-cutting team as advisers that consult agency heads on the termination of contracts and grants. No language in the orders gives the DOGE team members the authority to direct the cancellation of grants or contracts. However, the depositions portray Riley [former consultant for McKinsey & Co. and DOGE member] as giving directions on how to conduct the terminations.\n\n\nJeremy Berg, who led the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the NIH from 2003 to 2011, told ProPublica that the administration’s assessment of the institution was “not fair and not based on any substantial analysis or evidence,” and the proposed cuts “would be absolutely devastating to NIH and to biomedical research in the United States.”\n\n\nJudge Rejects Trump’s ‘Appalling’ NIH LGBTQ, Race Grant Cuts\n\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/judge-clashes-with-trump-justice-department-over-nih-grant-cuts\n(Thanks KB)\n\n“This represents racial discrimination and discrimination against America’s LGBTQ community. That’s what this is,” said Judge William G. Young of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts. “I would be blind not to call it out. My duty is to call it out.”\n\n(Also, from VAC)\nhttps://www.axios.com/local/boston/2025/06/16/nih-grants-ordered-restored\n(Also)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/16/us/trump-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\nUniversities Sue, Judge Blocks DOD’s Indirect Costs Cap\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/20/universities-sue-judge-blocks-dods-indirect-costs-cap\n\nJohns Hopkins, Arizona State and Cornell Universities are among a coalition of 12 higher education institutions and three trade groups that filed a lawsuit against the Department of Defense on Monday over the agency’s plan to cap universities’ indirect research cost rates at 15 percent.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge in Boston issued a temporary restraining order, prohibiting the DOD from enacting the cap. A hearing in the case is set for July 2.\n\n\nFor example, Johns Hopkins and the DOD currently have in place a negotiated indirect cost rate of 55 percent. In 2024 JHU received $32 million from the DOD to cover indirect costs, according to the lawsuit. If the DOD’s plan moves forward, however, the university would lose $22 million."

    "text": "Tennessee Lawsuit Puts HSIs’ Fate on the Line\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/13/tenn-lawsuit-puts-hispanic-servings-fate-line\n\nTwo years after its Supreme Court victory against Harvard and UNC Chapel Hill, Students for Fair Admissions has a new target in its sights: Hispanic-serving institutions. On Wednesday, the advocacy group joined the state of Tennessee in suing the U.S. Department of Education, arguing that the criteria to become an HSI are unconstitutional and discriminatory. The move is distressing HSI advocates, who hoped to see the institutions left out of the political fray.\n\n\nFunding for Hispanic-Serving Institutions Is Discriminatory and Unconstitutional, Lawsuit Argues\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/funding-for-hispanic-serving-institution-is-discriminatory-unconstitutional-lawsuit-argues\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nNew state laws target job protections for college professors\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/18/tenure-college-faculty-republican-challenges/\nhttps://hechingerreport.org/special-reports/higher-education/\n\nHONOLULU — The “gravy train.” That’s what a Hawaii state senator called the practice of awarding tenure to university research faculty when she proposed legislation in 2022 stripping this long-standing form of job protection from them.\n\n\nThe bill got little notice at the time. Now, obscured by the turmoil of the many other challenges to higher education since the start of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, tenure has come under siege in states across the country.\n\n\n“It’s the flip side of the same assault,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, or AFT, which represents 400,000 faculty and other university and college employees. “Some of the assault is coming from taking away grants, and some of the assault is coming by taking away tenure.”\n\n(But it doesn’t seem to be driven by a newly appointed leader)\n\n“To me, it’s about the Senate wanting control over the university,” said Christian Fern, executive director of the University of Hawai‘i Professional Assembly, the faculty union.\n\n(States mentioned: Hawaii, Nebraska, Ohio, Kentucky, Texas, Indiana, Arkansas, North Dakota, Kansas)\n\n“This level of attack couldn’t gain the kind of momentum it has without the declining public support for higher education,” Reuben [Harvard historian] said. “It couldn’t have happened to this magnitude before, because there was a general sense that higher education was good for society.”"

If they succeed, it could affect about 7,000 international scholars and potentially deliver a disabling blow to the campus’s finances, curriculum and identity.\n\n\nIn their court filing, Harvard’s lawyers argued that broad language was necessary because the government had “committed to continuing — indeed to intensifying — its retaliatory campaign,” one that can “throw Harvard and its international community into turmoil.”\n\n\nThe litigation, which is one of two cases Harvard has filed against the Trump administration, began last month when the Department of Homeland Security said it was revoking Harvard’s ability to host students under a system called the Student Exchange and Visitor Program.\n\n\nA lawyer for Harvard, Ian Gershengorn, accused the administration of resorting to “shenanigans” in its efforts to bar foreign students from Harvard.\n\n\nHarvard has said the actions aren’t grounded in real violations but instead are retaliation for its refusal to bend to the administration’s will.\n\n\nJudge Waits to Rule on Trump’s Effort to Bar Harvard Foreign Students\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/17/judge-delays-ruling-trump-ban-harvard-foreign\n\nIn a hearing on Monday, a federal judge put off making a ruling on whether to continue blocking President Trump’s proclamation banning Harvard international students and researchers from entering the country. The judge, Allison Burroughs of the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, agreed to decide within a week and extended an order to temporarily halt the policy until then.\n\n\nThe hearing came after Harvard swiftly filed a legal challenge to Trump’s directive in early June, a day after it was issued. Burroughs quickly granted a temporary restraining order and is now weighing a longer-lasting injunction.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Negotiation or Capitulation? How Columbia Got Off Trump’s Hot Seat.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/nyregion/columbia-middle-east-studies-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nWhile many in the academic world have accused Columbia of caving to Mr. Trump’s pressure, the university’s strategy — so far — has limited the bleeding, even as Harvard has absorbed cut after cut, stretching into billions of dollars. While opponents of the Trump administration’s crackdown have lauded Harvard for standing its ground, it is far from clear which school will be better off in the long run. And the question remains whether Columbia’s path can offer a road map for other universities attacked by the president.\n\n\nStill, the federal Department of Education threatened Columbia’s accreditation in early June, saying that in its eyes, the school was no longer meeting the standards necessary for the key credential, alleging it had “acted with deliberate indifference” toward the harassment of Jewish students.\n\n\n“There is a basic principle of academic freedom that is under attack, but I still believe in it,” he said. “And I think everybody in this department believes in it. And I think the students we teach believe in it.”\n\n\nFederal Judge Dismisses AAUP Lawsuit Challenging Columbia Grant Freezes\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/17/judge-dismisses-lawsuit-over-columbia-grant-freezes\n\nJudge Mary Kay Vyskocil of the Southern District of New York, however, ruled that the unions had no standing to file the lawsuit in the first place—only the university could do that, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration froze Northwestern’s research funding. It hasn’t offered the school a way to get it back.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/northwestern-funding-freeze-trump-85d49da2?st=fGDDU3&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nThrough the spring, Northwestern used university money to pay bills previously covered by NIH grants, spending tens of millions of dollars monthly to keep labs and trials running without a break. Researchers and administrators now worry this stopgap can’t last.\n\n\n“The university is totally keeping us on life support,” said Dr. Daniela Matei, a Northwestern oncologist. “The big question is for how long they can do this.”\n\n\nThe sudden collapse of the once-symbiotic relationship between the federal government and higher education is torpedoing a half-century-old university business model and upending how science is done.\n\n\nIt’s a complete turnaround for today’s university researchers, for whom federal funding—from NIH, National Science Foundation, and other agencies—has never been in question. Billions of dollars have flowed annually to universities through competitive grants, funding basic research that can lead to cutting-edge medicine and technological innovations.\n\n\nAt places like Harvard and Columbia, funding cuts or freezes have come with lists of demands spanning changes to admissions and faculty hiring.\n\n\nAt others, like Northwestern, the path to restoration is less clear. In April, a Trump administration official told media that $790 million in federal funds to the Illinois university would be frozen, but that number has never been detailed or communicated directly to school officials, a school spokesman said. Nor has Trump told the university what they can do to get the money returned, the spokesman said, though the school’s president has met with Trump’s education secretary to discuss the situation on campus.\n\n\nUniversity officials say bills to NIH have simply gone unpaid. NIH grant officers in April were told not to communicate with Northwestern and other affected universities about the freeze, according to an email viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Northwestern researchers have had grants terminated or frozen from multiple agencies, the university said.\n\n\nFacing Research Cuts, Officials at U. of Iowa Spoke of a ‘Limited Ability to Publicly Fight This’\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/facing-research-cuts-officials-at-u-of-iowa-spoke-of-a-limited-ability-to-publicly-fight-this\n\nAsked by a faculty member what he and his peers could do to help, the University of Iowa’s interim vice president for research suggested only “acting as a private citizen to call our legislators and tell them what a bad idea this is (from your own phone or using your own email).” The campus’s location in a solidly red state hindered it from fighting the policy change, Lois J. Geist seemed to imply in her reply. “Being located where we are we have limited ability to publicly fight this as faculty or as an institution.”"

The University of Minnesota is cutting hundreds of jobs,…\n\n\nStudents and employees from coast to coast are poised to feel the squeeze. Although the exact consequences will vary by school, administrators are warning that many students may have to pay more, professors may lose their jobs, programs could vanish and support services could shrink.\n\n\nThe Trump administration’s efforts to reduce research funding are siphoning cash from many campuses, sometimes by hundreds of millions of dollars. But that is just one factor contributing to higher education’s financial crunch. Colleges, like businesses and households, are facing greater costs for wages, supplies, utilities and other expenses.\n\n\nIn Minnesota, students are set to pay more for less. … Tuition at the Twin Cities campus will rise by at least 6.5 percent. But the university is also pursuing cuts of 7 percent.\n\n(See attempts to soften here:\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/u-of-minnesota-tries-to-soften-the-blow-of-tuition-hikes-budget-cuts-with-faculty-benefits )\n\nTo manage the financial pressures, school leaders said they “anticipate involuntary reductions in head count.”\n\n\nBut Dr. Mitchell, the American Council on Education president, and a former president of Occidental College, emphasized the range of schools that were facing financial headwinds.\n\n\n“This isn’t just the Ivies, and this just isn’t the result of headline freezes on big research projects,” he said. “This reflects more uncertainty in the basic economy.”"

Starting next semester, she’s planning to have her students write their responses in class to deter the use of AI—and she’s even considering requiring them to write the answers out by hand.\n\n\nYour Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1\n\nWith today’s wide adoption of LLM products like ChatGPT from OpenAI, humans and businesses engage and use LLMs on a daily basis. Like any other tool, it carries its own set of advantages and limitations. This study focuses on finding out the cognitive cost of using an LLM in the educational context of writing an essay.\n\n\nAs the educational impact of LLM use only begins to settle with the general population, in this study we demonstrate the pressing matter of a likely decrease in learning skills based on the results of our study. The use of LLM had a measurable impact on participants, and while the benefits were initially apparent, as we demonstrated over the course of 4 months, the LLM group’s participants performed worse than their counterparts in the Brain-only group at all levels: neural, linguistic, scoring.\n\n\nWhat Will Be Left of Higher Ed in Four Years?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-will-be-left-of-higher-ed-in-four-years\n\nA recent report from the consulting firm Deloitte confirms what everyone working in higher education already knows: Donald Trump “brings a layer of complexity to questions of financial sustainability for colleges and universities.” The administration’s dizzying range of punitive measures for academe comes at an inconvenient time: Our institutions are already grappling with diminished state support and a looming demographic cliff.\n\n\nResearch universities face the greatest financial pressure. Grant cancellations and planned cuts to the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health are creating enormous budgetary holes: The budgets for graduate programs and scientific-research staffing were developed on the assumption that federal funding was a constant.\n\n\nIn red states like Florida, Indiana, and Texas, Trump-supporting Legislatures are also working to bust up faculty and administrative autonomy as a condition of public funding. The administration’s cultural agenda for higher ed is likely to be advanced most fully in states where MAGA-friendly legislatures have near-total control. This doesn’t mean blue-state public research universities are off the hook. Data shows that state financial support for higher ed has been up over the past couple of years, but we might have reached high tide. Ebbing state funding would pair dangerously with cuts to federal research.\n\n\nRegional Publics and Community Colleges\n\n\nAt first glance these institutions appear to be in an enviable position: They don’t rely heavily on federal research funding, they don’t have big endowments to tax, they don’t enroll lots of international students, and they tend to fly below the political radar. Domestic undergraduate enrollment is unlikely to collapse, and a looming economic downturn could even cause an uptick in demand for these institutions since people look to increase their skills and retrain during recessions. Still, the major financial-aid reform provisions tucked away in the “Big, Beautiful” reconciliation bill recently passed by the House will clearly affect these institutions if enacted, though in mixed ways. For community colleges, their lower tuition prices, shorter program duration, and a vocational orientation might yield comparative advantages in a world with diminished federal student aid. Risk-sharing provisions that put campuses on the hook for portions of unpaid student debt might harm minority-serving institutions and campuses that serve low-income and other students with historically higher rates of loan default. Requiring full-time enrollment for Pell Grant eligibility, as proposed in the House bill, would harm these institutions too. The Senate seems less excited about the risk-sharing and full-time Pell provisions, but the financial-aid outlook remains murky.\n\n\nRegional universities and community colleges also face enrollment risks. Pennsylvania State University plans to shutter several regional campuses, and federal pressure on research universities will have knock-on effects within state university systems. Looking to secure their own budgets, research universities might employ aggressive tactics to lure students otherwise headed to regional campuses.\n\n\nRather than forming partnerships with the federal government, colleges will now have to endure the headwinds created by federal policy and, in some cases, engage in direct confrontation with the administration. I do not believe Trump will be able to destroy American higher education, but his administration will try, and the sector will suffer. Research footprints will shrink, the number of programs and activities on offer will be reduced, and the workloads of already-overextended faculty and staff will increase. Senior administrators can’t say so, but in the next few years colleges and universities will become diminished versions of themselves. Those of us who teach or work in higher ed will watch our institutions decline.\n\n\nCampuses will look for revenue to replace federal dollars. Public research universities will increase their enrollments, often at the expense of their regional counterparts. Our wealthiest colleges may quietly roll back their need-blind admissions policies. The steady trickle of emails from university communications announcing exciting new cancer research efforts and new science facilities will slow. Departmental budgets will be slashed to the point where faculty concern is less for vanishing tenure lines than for the survival of the department itself. Teaching course loads will grow, library operational hours will shrink, and students, stung by loan restrictions and red tape, will increasingly rush from class to part-time jobs. In short, the sector will be smaller, poorer, and capable of doing fewer things."

A Candid Interview With One President Shows How.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-gaza-protests-are-still-haunting-college-leaders-a-candid-interview-with-one-president-shows-how\n\nAs the beginnings of a pro-Palestinian encampment formed on Northwestern University’s Deering Meadow in April 2024, then-President Michael H. Schill faced three choices: let the encampment continue; bring in the campus police to break it up; or negotiate with the student activists.\n\n\nBut that quickly ran into a snag. Schill was wary of sending in Northwestern’s small police force, so he asked the Evanston Police Department for help. The night they were going to take action, Schill said, “the mayor of Evanston called me and said he would not be sending in the police. I said to him, ‘We have a mutual-aid agreement.’ He said, ‘You know, you can sue me if you want.’”\n\n\nSo Schill took the third option: negotiation.\n\n\nBut Schill’s remarks reflect the inescapable fact that the encampments that sprung up a year and a half ago are still haunting college leaders, particularly as Republican lawmakers apply aggressive scrutiny to campuses’ handling of antisemitism.\n\n\nIn his interview, Schill told the assembled group of investigators and attorneys that negotiating was the only choice he had. “A lot of people find what we did distasteful. A lot of Jewish people in particular find what we did … distasteful,” said Schill, who is Jewish. “I then ask them what they would do. No one has given me — and I’ve had this conversation probably 300 times where we go through everything. I tell them, ‘What would you have done differently?’ And they just get frustrated because they don’t have another option, unless just let it go on forever, and they don’t like that either.”\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Antisemitic Slurs Disrupt Queens College Zoom Lecture About Israel\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/12/nyregion/antisemitic-slurs-queens-college-lecture.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAn Israeli law professor was only minutes into her online lecture about the erosion of the rights of women and sexual minorities in her country on Monday when an eruption of hate and misogyny filled the screen.\n\n\nThe Queens College event — which was happening over Zoom — was abruptly interrupted by what appeared to be a group of attendees who turned on their cameras and microphones and began yelling slurs, including “kill all the Jews” and “go back to Auschwitz.” Instead of faces on the screen, pornographic and disturbing images appeared, including pictures of dead bodies and video clips of male masturbation.\n\n\nThe event, an annual lecture sponsored by the Center for Jewish Studies at Queens College, illustrated how even Israeli academics critical of the war in Gaza such as Professor Tirosh, a law professor at Tel Aviv University, are being hit with antisemitic attacks as they deliver their views, presumably because they are Israeli.\n\n\nThe lecture had been advertised online and was open to the public. In an email, a Queens College spokeswoman said an investigation had determined that one person had registered as multiple attendees, then exploited a wrongly configured screen-sharing setting in the Zoom lecture to make the disruption happen from all those accounts at once. The college added that it would take immediate steps to reinforce its security protocols to prevent future incidents. Another similar disruption, which happened earlier this month during a Zoom lecture about an archaeological expedition in Africa, was also being investigated.\n\n\nThough several antisemitic incidents were reported on campus in the past two years, Queens College has earned praise from Jewish organizations for its defense of Jewish students. It earned an “A” grade this year from the Anti-Defamation League for its efforts and initiatives to combat antisemitism, one of 11 schools in the nation to do so.\n\n(From Queens College)\n\nQueens College has longstanding Zoom security measures in place to prevent unauthorized disruptions. These include: - Restricting screen sharing to the host only. - Requiring meeting passcodes and waiting rooms for all sessions. - Enabling authentication, requiring attendees to log in using verified CUNY credentials. - Disabling file transfers and private chat to minimize opportunities for disruption. Following these incidents, we are working to review these procedures with the college community to ensure that all online events are configured according to these security protocols.\n\n\nWhat Can You Say on Campus at a Public University or College?

The latest round will affect nontenure-track faculty, administrators, and staff. The university will also cut about $4.3 million in other expenses to eliminate a total of $29.2 million in recurring spending.\n\n\nAdministrators have said the structural deficit resulted from factors including out-of-state enrollment that was lower than expected, growing compensation costs, and anemic state funding.\n\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the announcement, faculty members pressed administrators to hold off on their plans, including holding an emergency meeting with the executive committee of the University Senate and gaining support from the American Association of University Professors and some state legislators, among other measures. University leaders announced in June that the Board of Trustees had directed them to put plans in place by mid-September to close a structural deficit of $25 million to $30 million. That timeline meant most of the budget deliberations took place over the summer, when many faculty members were off contract and off campus.\n\n\nThe University of Oregon is not alone in struggling to implement shared governance.

The amendment to the state’s education law requires these “coordinators” to ensure there is a centralized review, investigation and resolution process for alleged violations of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin, including shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. It also requires the state Division of Human Services to develop compliance training for students and employees that will be delivered annually.\n\n\nCUNY leadership says the university has already invested millions into doing the work to combat hate crimes and antisemitism.\n\n\nCUNY has invested more than $2 million to combat hate crimes and antisemitism, including mandatory Title VI training for its faculty and staff, Chancellor Felix Matos Rodriguez said in a statement included in Hochul’s announcement..\n\n\n“Every college is required to have a Chief Diversity Officer on campus who is responsible for addressing allegations of discrimination, including Title VI complaints,” CUNY spokesperson Noah Gardy told THE CITY in a written statement. “CUNY will work with all the campuses to ensure that a Title VI coordinator is in place to comply with the law, which goes into effect next year.”\n\n(Also touches on Hunter College Job ad, former Chief Judge of New York Jonathan Lippman’s report, and the governor’s view on the definition from IRHA of antisemitism.\n\nStudents Report Less Tolerance for Controversial Speakers\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/free-speech/2025/09/09/tolerance-controversial-campus-speakers-declines\n\nCollege students—particularly those who identify as conservative—are less likely to tolerate controversial speech than they were last year, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression’s annual survey.\n\n\nBut changes on both issues were driven primarily by conservative students’ decreased willingness to allow controversial speech on campus; liberal students reported a level of tolerance similar to previous years.

The Trump administration is attempting to repeal that theory.\n\n\nAccreditation: The department wants to change the regulations for accreditation to clarify a college’s ability to change accreditors and to make it easier for the department to recognize new accreditors.\n\n\nTitle IV Eligibility: The department wants to change the rules to make it easier for certain for-profit and religious institutions to access federal student aid.\n\n\nMcMahon to Higher Ed Leaders: Join Us to ‘Make Higher Ed Great Again’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/09/09/mcmahon-dings-university-leaders-cites-hillsdale\n(The woman who wants to bring everyone A1 …)\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon denounced higher education as broken in a speech Monday at Hillsdale College in Michigan, directing her remarks primarily at four-year institutions and pitching her vision for how to improve American colleges and universities.\n\n\nMcMahon largely directed her speech to college leaders, arguing that “the crisis of higher education is first and foremost a crisis of leadership.” She called on them to work with the Trump administration to “make higher education great again.”\n\n\nShe wants to see a system of higher education that’s rigorous and prepares students for a career, but is also dedicated to truth-seeking and committed to treating institutions as “repositories of our civilizational inheritance,” according to a transcript of her remarks. She raised concerns about colleges allegedly taking “real American history” out of the curriculum and questioned whether tax dollars should go to institutions that detract from “our nation’s strength.”\n\n\nMcMahon’s stop at Hillsdale is part of her nationwide Returning Education to the States tour.\n\n(Hillsdale is a safe space to dismantle education)\n\nRoss Mugler, acting president of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, and others said McMahon’s comments “misrepresent the reality on college campuses today” and reflect an “unrealistic approach and assessment of higher education in this country.” … “Higher ed isn’t broken; it’s adapting,” he said.\n\n\nTrump Administration Takes Next Step in Dismantling ED\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/09/trump-administration-takes-next-step-dismantling-ed\n\nThe Trump administration has taken another step toward dismantling the Department of Education, creating a new integrated “state plan portal” that will allow the Department of Labor to jointly administer adult education programs with ED.\n\n\n“To prepare our next generation of American workers, the Trump Administration is taking decisive action to streamline unnecessary bureaucracy and advance the skills needed to fill jobs of the future,” Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a news release.\n\n\n“Donald Trump and Linda McMahon are continuing their attempts to illegally dismantle the Department of Education—and they are risking critical career and technical and adult education programs,” Democratic Senators Patty Murray and Tammy Baldwin, and Democratic Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro said in a statement. “Linda McMahon and Donald Trump need to follow the plain text of the law—period.

The Commerce Department didn’t return requests for comment Wednesday about how the Trump administration could legally get around that law.\n\n\n“The proposal would obliterate the progress that university tech transfer has enjoyed in the 45 years since the passage of the seminal Bayh-Dole Act, which facilitated new university-industry partnerships and led to an explosion of technological progress and substantial economic gains,” Hudson said. “If enacted, the proposal would stifle the U.S. innovation pipeline, with the American people, not universities, being the ultimate losers.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWork-Study Funding, Child Care at Risk of Severe Cuts in House Bill, Advocates Warn\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/work-study-funding-child-care-at-risk-of-severe-cuts-in-house-bill-advocates-warn\n\nCollege advocates warn that a series of cuts tucked into a U.S. House of Representatives budget bill could have serious consequences for struggling students and institutions. The House is expected to vote Tuesday on the bill, which contains language threatening programs that support adult students and canceling work-study funding.

The menace now is within. And with very few exceptions, the leaders of American universities have done little more than duck and cover.\n\n\nIn 1958, by a bipartisan vote, Congress passed and President Dwight Eisenhower signed the National Defense Education Act, one of the most consequential federal interventions in education in the nation’s history. Together with the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, it made America into the world’s undisputed leader in science and technology.\n\n\nThe N.D.E.A. reflected the widespread realization that something had to be done in schools and universities besides teaching students to hide under their desks. The country urgently needed more trained physicists, chemists, mathematicians, aerospace engineers, electrical engineers, material scientists and a host of other experts in STEM fields, and the government grasped that to get them would take a massive infusion of money pumped into schools and universities: roughly $1 billion, the equivalent of more than $11 billion today.\n\n\nUntil 1962, recipients of N.D.E.A. funds had to sign an affidavit affirming that they did not support any organization that sought to overthrow the U.S. government. But in one of those moments in which the right policy is chosen for the wrong reason, Southern segregationists in Congress, worried that some of the funds might be used to further desegregation efforts, added a provision stipulating that no part of the act would allow the federal government to dictate school curriculum, instruction, administration or personnel.\n\n\nThese transformations wound up playing a significant role in my own career. When I went back to Yale for graduate work, the N.D.E.A. funded my Ph.D. The government was not under the illusion that studying Shakespeare was rocket science. But Title IV of the act, calling for an increase in the number of university professors, extended support to the humanities as well as the sciences. Sputnik had turned out to include me in its orbit.\n\n\nShould the Trump administration settle for one-time fines, universities, chastened by the threats of the past few months, may yet recover their footing. But if, as seems entirely possible, the administration is determined to reshape the intellectual life and values of faculty members and students alike, then such recovery will be impossible.\n\n\nWhy on earth would we abandon institutions that have genuinely made America great? Why would we squander the world’s admiration for this magnificent achievement of ours? Why would we put at risk laboratories that are working to cure cancers or perfecting artificial limbs or exploring deep space or testing the limits of artificial intelligence?\n\n\n\n\nAccreditors Venture Into the Microcredential Landscape\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/accreditation/2025/09/08/accreditors-venture-microcredential-landscape\n\nThe microcredential landscape is often called a “wild west” in higher ed circles.\n\n\nThe field is crowded with tens of thousands of program providers, in and outside of academia, online and in person. Short-term programs vary widely, from certificates to badges to boot camps, spanning weeks to months to over a year. And while some programs offer high returns, others yield little to none or insufficiently track outcomes.\n\n\nNow, two accrediting agencies are stepping into that murky terrain, hoping to bring some order—and branch out into a new market. Both the New England Commission of Higher Education and the Higher Learning Commission, which has been researching short-term programs for eight years, are gearing up to assess whether providers of these programs meet their standards.\n\n(MSCHE?)\n\n\n\n\nWhen the next Democratic President uses Donald Trump’s precedent to target campus conservatives or climate “deniers,” the right will be singing Harvard’s current fight song.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-harvard-judge-allison-burroughs-first-amendment-4c00709e?st=XuU53K&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(The WSJ almost gets it, but always trips on its bias)\n\nNYTimes: Settlement Talks Stall Between Harvard and the Trump Administration\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/06/us/politics/harvard-trump-negotiations-stall.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(The same bylines for some 3 months now trying to peddle a story with slant that only helps one side… Now the message they carry—settle or the terms will ge t worse)\n\nOne major reason is an emerging divide within the administration between aides eager to deliver President Trump a political victory by announcing a deal and those who contend the current framework is too favorable to Harvard. Some Trump advisers argue that one way to strengthen the agreement would be to subject Harvard to an independent monitor who would ensure compliance. Harvard has consistently opposed that idea.\n\n\nTalks have also slowed in recent weeks with Cornell University and Northwestern University, although the reasons are unclear.\n\n\nThe government’s tactics — cutting research grants, opening investigations and demanding hundreds of millions of dollars or more in settlement payments — have plunged campuses into financial and political crises. Some schools, like Columbia University, negotiated deals with the Trump administration.\n\n\nThe slowdown in talks with universities is a signal that the administration is still acclimating to the departure of May Mailman, who, as the White House’s senior policy strategist, was a driving force behind Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign. She stepped back from that position last month as part of a long-planned return home to Texas.\n\n(Huh? Perhaps they are slowing due to the illegality of the approach being declared in the courts?)\n\nA deal with Harvard was nearing the finish line only a month ago. [As reported just by these three writers]\n\n\nMr. Trump’s enthusiasm for an agreement has been clear since June, when he posted on social media that a “mindbogglingly historic” agreement with Harvard could be finalized within days.\n\n\nHarvard beat Trump in court. Here’s what could happen next.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/09/05/harvard-trump-funding-battle /\n\nThe challenges are unprecedented: They include a promised appeal in court, worry that the government will slow-walk restoring frozen research funds, threats to future grants, complicated settlement negotiations — and the prospect of another 3½ years of a hostile White House with a bevy of arrows in its quiver and a proven willingness to aim them at its opponents.\n\n\nHarvard Was Cleared To Get Some Federal Funds. Then DOGE Stepped In. | News | The Harvard Crimson\n\nhttps://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/9/8/doge-blocks-nih-grants/\n\nThe National Institutes of Health began allocating some grants to Harvard in July to comply with a federal court ruling. But Department of Government Efficiency officials have quietly blocked all the funds at the last mile, withholding money because the University has not reached a settlement, according to four people familiar with the matter, including NIH staff.\n\n\nThe NIH resumed issuing some grants in mid-July to schools, including Harvard, that had been barred from receiving federal dollars under April guidance, according to an internal memo obtained by The Crimson. But officials from DOGE, the government cost-cutting group, used their control over the NIH’s payment system to keep the money out of researchers’ hands.\n\n\nThe extent of DOGE’s role in quietly obstructing NIH grant disbursements to universities — even after the agency was legally compelled to begin restoring some awards in July — has not been previously reported. And it suggests that, even in the absence of a formal stay or injunction, DOGE may use its power over federal payments to continue to quietly sidestep the Wednesday ruling that directs the Trump administration to reinstate the more than $2.7 billion in federal grants to Harvard that the administration froze or terminated in the spring.\n\n(Table By Saketh Sundar — Crimson Designer)\n\n\n\nUniversity\nSize of Freeze\nSettled?\nStatus of NIH Funds\n\n\n\n\nHarvard\n2.6 billion\nNo\nRestricted\n\n\nBrown\n510 million\nYes\nFlowing post-deal\n\n\nNorthwestern\n790 million\nNo\nRestricted**\n\n\nPenn\n175 million\nYes\nFlowing post-deal\n\n\nColumbia\n400 million\nYes\nFlowing post-deal\n\n\nUCLA\n584 million\nNo\nFlowing post-cut\n\n\nDuke\n108 million\nNo\nFlowing post-cut\n\n\nCornell\n1 billion\nNo\nPartially restricted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Harvard Can Out-Negotiate Trump | TIME\n\nhttps://time.com/7314798/harvard-can-out-negotiate-trump/\n(By leaders from Yale and past president of Dartmouth)\n\nPresident Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed great negotiator, has fumbled at the bargaining table once more.\n\n\nHe failed to intimidate India and China in trade talks, setting the stage for inflation to rise and for America’s greatest rivals to unite. His ingratiating groveling to Russian President Vladimir Putin was unable to bring about the ceasefire he promised—despite entering negotiations with the upper hand. Now, the “great negotiator” seems to have lost his cards again in his epic standoff with the world’s top-rated university.\n\n\nFor an administration that claims to be concerned about maintaining technological and scientific supremacy against international rivals, the political warfare on higher education makes no sense. As widely documented, American universities serve as the strongest engines for research, innovation, and economic growth. The direct, and indirect, economic impact of U.S. universities on the national GDP is significant and undeniable. Sectors that American schools underpin such as digital commerce, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence account for nearly half of the U.S. GDP, drive almost all GDP growth, and total twice the size of federal government spending.\n\n\nIn the context of America’s trade deficit, universities are a major export for the U.S., and one of the few sectors in which we have a large trade surplus. Universities, particularly through the influx of international students, contribute significantly to the U.S. trade surplus, with international students contributing $44 billion to the economy and the trade surplus in education accounting for about 15% of total U.S. services trade surplus—comparable to the combined exports of soybeans, coal, and natural gas.\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Is Told Research Money Could Flow Again, for Now\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/us/harvard-research-funding-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(The three writers on the Harvard beat who have been consistently premature, have this to add)\n\nThe Trump administration says it will restart the flow of federal research money to Harvard University, following a judge’s ruling that a sweeping blockade of funds was illegal, according to five people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The New York Times.\n\n\nHarvard received at least one letter this week from the Trump administration saying that hundreds of grants were being restored, according to a person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private correspondence. Individual researchers have begun receiving notices from the government about restored funding, including an astronomy professor, whose $3.7 million NASA grant seems to have been resurrected.\n\n\nIt is possible that funding will be disrupted again, even if the government begins making payments. The Justice Department, for example, could seek a stay of last week’s decision by Judge Allison D. Burroughs, who sits on the federal bench in Boston, and ask the court for permission to suspend the funding once again while its appeal proceeds.\n\n\nHarvard officials were surprised by the development, and unsure whether the White House knew that federal agencies seemed set to restore Harvard’s money, according to a person familiar with the university officials’ thinking. They wondered whether the West Wing would intervene to cut the funding off again.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: At George Mason University, Trump Has Found an Unbending Adversary\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/06/us/george-mason-university-gregory-washington-trump-attack.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(An “adversary”?)\n\nPresident Trump’s interpretation of the Civil Rights Act, historically aimed at protecting Black people and members of other minority groups from discrimination, has infuriated his critics. And as if to twist the knife, the Trump administration has also demanded a personal public apology from Dr. Washington over his efforts to support racial diversity — which it described as unlawful and discriminatory.\n\n\nThe refusal has made the George Mason president one of the few university leaders who has explicitly, and publicly, challenged the Trump administration. He joins a short list of other higher education leaders, including the presidents of Harvard and Princeton.\n\n\nBut unlike many of his peers, Dr. Washington has been targeted as an individual, and so his choice to resist the Trump administration’s demands leaves him in an uncommonly precarious position.\n\n\n“Singling out a Black leader in this way is not only unprecedented but also deeply troubling,” the university chapter of the American Association of University Professors said in a statement last week.\n\n(And they can write this without better phrasing, such as “Without reason…”)\n\nThe Trump administration has made attacking universities central to its agenda.\n\n\nThe Education Department’s assistant secretary for civil rights, Craig Trainor, upped the pressure in a statement last month, saying Dr. Washington “waged a university-wide campaign to implement unlawful D.E.I. policies that intentionally discriminate on the basis of race,” the statement said, adding, “You can’t make this up.”\n\n\n“They are literally investigating me for what they call offenses I made back in 2020, 2021 and that’s problematic,” he [GM President Washington] said. “It’s like changing the speed limit and charging you for speeding four years ago.”\n\n\nVirginia Democrats Accuse GMU Rector of Conflict of Interest\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/trustees-regents/2025/09/09/virginia-democrats-accuse-gmu-rector-conflict-interest\n\nVirginia Democrats want George Mason University board rector Charles Stimson to recuse himself from federal investigations into the university as well as discussions about the university president’s future, saying that his role at the Heritage Foundation, which recently released a report critical of GMU, presents a conflict of interest.\n\n\nThe letter comes almost two weeks after a state Senate committee blocked 14 gubernatorial appointments to university boards, including six at GMU, which left the Board of Visitors without a quorum.

I was already delaying that for one month. And so, yeah, it’s still delayed, but that’s fine. I can take it. But IPAM, they didn’t have the reserves to operate for more than a few months. So basically, for the past two weeks or so, we’ve been in an emergency fundraising mode. I’ve been meeting with lots of donors.\n\n\nThe NSF grant that I had, I mean its primary purpose was to support my graduate students, give them the opportunity to travel to a conference, which is really important for career development at that stage,\n\n\nQ: If things do go back to normal, why does the uncertainty make a difference? A: In order to do the best science, you also need to have a somewhat tranquil mental state. Just to give it an analogy, suppose it’s a little bit chilly. It’s 60 degrees in your home, and so you set your heater to 72. But suppose that your thermostat suddenly changes the temperature to 100 degrees and then to 40 degrees and finally it’s back to 72 degrees. On paper, you now have the right temperature, but you’re not feeling too good after this. And somehow you can’t relax and sort of be productive, especially if you are worried that it’s going to do that again.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the U. of Chicago’s Financial Strains Are a Warning for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-the-u-of-chicagos-financial-strains-are-a-warning-for-higher-ed\n\nAnd then, just over a week ago, the university revealed a wide-ranging cost-saving plan aimed at reducing spending by $100 million, including: - a 30-percent reduction in its rate of tenure-track hiring - a 30-percent reduction in internally funded Ph.D. candidates by 2030–31 - a pause on certain new capital projects, along with a reduced footprint for the university’s planned engineering and science building - a staff reduction of 100–150 nonclinical employees - a 20-percent reduction in unrestricted funding toward campus centers Reviews of smaller programs are also planned.\n\n\nAlthough red ink isn’t new to the university — its academic operations have run operating deficits since 2011 — the scale of its deficits worsened sharply in late 2021-22, surging to over $225 million annually and coinciding with rising inflation rates. As for Chicago’s most recently completed fiscal year, which ended six months after the second inauguration of Donald Trump — heralding a dramatic shift in the federal government’s relationship with higher ed — President Paul Alivisatos told faculty the university’s annual income had once again fallen short of expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHas Trump Ended Staten Island’s Wind Power Dreams?\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/09/staten-island-offshore-wind-trump/\n\nFor over a decade, New York has worked to bring wind power jobs to Staten Island as part of an ambitious plan to establish the state as the biggest hub of offshore wind. A centerpiece of the effort, situated in the southwest of the island, is the Arthur Kill Terminal (AKT), an envisioned staging and assembly port.\n\n\nBut on Friday, the Trump administration’s Department of Transportation rescinded a 2022 $48 million grant supporting the project that had been funded by President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\n\n“There’s a lot of money invested in this industry already, and these companies can’t take the hit.”\n\n\nThe construction of the facility would create 600 jobs, according to Charles Dougherty, AKT’s chief commercial officer, and once up and running, manufacturing work would sustain 100 to 150 jobs, all union. The project would also add nearly $400 billion in “direct economic impact” according to Empire State Development.\n\n\nBringing wind power to Staten Island, which has only voted for a Democrat presidential candidate four times in history, used to be a bipartisan project. Staten Island’s GOP representative, Nicole Malliotakis, has supported AKT, while boasting of the economic and environmental benefits of expanding wind power facilities in her district. She voted for Biden’s infrastructure package, and on Earth Day 2022 introduced legislation to create a program to share federal offshore wind revenue with states. In April, despite Trump’s order halting offshore wind development, Rep. Malliotakis petitioned the Army Corp of Engineers to nonetheless expedite the remaining federal permit for AKT. Her office did not respond to a request for comment, but after the Department of Transportation announced on Friday that it would pull its financial support of the terminal, Malliotakis told the Staten Island Advance she would push the agency “to get the funding repurposed to another maritime, port infrastructure or economic development project that would benefit Staten Island.”\n\n\nBeyond investments in infrastructure, local officials also worked to build the island’s workforce. Beginning in 2023, New York City’s Economic Development Corporation gave over half a million to the College of Staten Island to “train the next generation of professionals for offshore wind careers.” The day before the 2024 election, AKT provided the college another $1 million to develop a future offshore wind industry workforce.\n\n\nNYTimes: Happy Birthday, LIGO. Now Drop Dead.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/science/gravitational-waves-ligo-black-holes.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIt’s been 10 years since astronomers first felt the universe tremble.\n\n\nThe whole encounter lasted one-fifth of a second. But that instant changed astrophysics, opening a window onto previously inaccessible realms of nature in which space could rip, bend, puff up, crumple and even vanish.\n\n\nIt was the first direct proof that ripples in space-time, predicted by Albert Einstein a century earlier, actually existed. In the decade since, LIGO and other experiments have logged more than 300 of these violent collisions, providing astronomers with clues regarding the evolution of black holes across cosmic history.\n\n\n…President Trump has proposed slashing LIGO’s operating budget in 2026 by 40 percent, to $29 million from $48 million, and eliminating one of the antennas. That could spell disaster, as it takes two antennas to triangulate the origins of gravitational waves.\n\n\nThe impact on performance and future upgrades would be devastating, he [David Reitze, a physicist at Caltech and director of the LIGO Laboratory] added: “It would be nearly impossible for LIGO to recover from a cut of this magnitude.”\n\n\nThe Rise of ‘Conspiracy Physics’\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/science/physics/the-rise-of-conspiracy-physics-dd79fe36?st=9CAcc5\n\nThis resentment of scientific authority figures is the major attraction of what might be called “conspiracy physics.” Most fringe theories are too arcane for listeners to understand, but anyone can grasp the idea that academic physics is just one more corrupt and self-serving establishment. The German physicist Sabine Hossenfelder has attracted 1.72 million YouTube subscribers in part by attacking her colleagues: “Your problem is that you’re lying to the people who pay you,” she declared. “Your problem is that you’re cowards without a shred of scientific integrity.”\n\n\n\n\n\nStates face massive new costs under Trump budget cuts\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/08/states-medicaid-snap-cuts-trump/\n\nStates are scrambling to prepare for an unprecedented shift of costs and responsibilities under President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and spending plan, which will force them to make difficult decisions about cuts to state programs to offset the new financial burdens.\n\n\nUnlike the federal government, states must balance their budgets each year. That means deep cuts and changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will require state legislatures and governors to cope with hundreds of millions of dollars in new costs each year.\n\n\nThe changes mean that about 10 million fewer people are expected to have health insurance over the next decade and 2.4 million fewer people are expected to participate in SNAP during an average month, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\nThe bill also sharply limits the provider tax, which states collect from hospitals and other providers to boost Medicaid payments and receive federal matching funds. The change, along with others in the bill, will cause an additional $366 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending, according to the CBO.\n\n\nThe Washington Post conducted a survey of all 50 states and the District of Columbia about how much they expected to incur in additional costs from the Republican bill, how many residents are expected to lose health care and access to food stamps, and what services might be cut as a result. Only 15 states and D.C. replied, with responses that varied largely along partisan lines. … Three GOP-led states — Arkansas, Ohio and North Dakota — said they did not anticipate cuts to other programs as a result of Medicaid and SNAP changes … Democratic-run states say the effects of the federal cutbacks will be severe, and several Democratic governors have said there is no way for states to backfill the scale of the cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Much Are Public-College Presidents Paid?

A Candid Interview With One President Shows How.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-gaza-protests-are-still-haunting-college-leaders-a-candid-interview-with-one-president-shows-how\n\nAs the beginnings of a pro-Palestinian encampment formed on Northwestern University’s Deering Meadow in April 2024, then-President Michael H. Schill faced three choices: let the encampment continue; bring in the campus police to break it up; or negotiate with the student activists.\n\n\nBut that quickly ran into a snag. Schill was wary of sending in Northwestern’s small police force, so he asked the Evanston Police Department for help. The night they were going to take action, Schill said, “the mayor of Evanston called me and said he would not be sending in the police. I said to him, ‘We have a mutual-aid agreement.’ He said, ‘You know, you can sue me if you want.’”\n\n\nSo Schill took the third option: negotiation.\n\n\nBut Schill’s remarks reflect the inescapable fact that the encampments that sprung up a year and a half ago are still haunting college leaders, particularly as Republican lawmakers apply aggressive scrutiny to campuses’ handling of antisemitism.\n\n\nIn his interview, Schill told the assembled group of investigators and attorneys that negotiating was the only choice he had. “A lot of people find what we did distasteful. A lot of Jewish people in particular find what we did … distasteful,” said Schill, who is Jewish. “I then ask them what they would do. No one has given me — and I’ve had this conversation probably 300 times where we go through everything. I tell them, ‘What would you have done differently?’ And they just get frustrated because they don’t have another option, unless just let it go on forever, and they don’t like that either.”",

In an email, a Queens College spokeswoman said an investigation had determined that one person had registered as multiple attendees, then exploited a wrongly configured screen-sharing setting in the Zoom lecture to make the disruption happen from all those accounts at once. The college added that it would take immediate steps to reinforce its security protocols to prevent future incidents. Another similar disruption, which happened earlier this month during a Zoom lecture about an archaeological expedition in Africa, was also being investigated.\n\n\nThough several antisemitic incidents were reported on campus in the past two years, Queens College has earned praise from Jewish organizations for its defense of Jewish students. It earned an “A” grade this year from the Anti-Defamation League for its efforts and initiatives to combat antisemitism, one of 11 schools in the nation to do so.\n\n(From Queens College)\n\nQueens College has longstanding Zoom security measures in place to prevent unauthorized disruptions. These include: - Restricting screen sharing to the host only. - Requiring meeting passcodes and waiting rooms for all sessions. - Enabling authentication, requiring attendees to log in using verified CUNY credentials. - Disabling file transfers and private chat to minimize opportunities for disruption. Following these incidents, we are working to review these procedures with the college community to ensure that all online events are configured according to these security protocols.\n\n\nWhat Can You Say on Campus at a Public University or College?

The latest round will affect nontenure-track faculty, administrators, and staff. The university will also cut about $4.3 million in other expenses to eliminate a total of $29.2 million in recurring spending.\n\n\nAdministrators have said the structural deficit resulted from factors including out-of-state enrollment that was lower than expected, growing compensation costs, and anemic state funding.\n\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the announcement, faculty members pressed administrators to hold off on their plans, including holding an emergency meeting with the executive committee of the University Senate and gaining support from the American Association of University Professors and some state legislators, among other measures. University leaders announced in June that the Board of Trustees had directed them to put plans in place by mid-September to close a structural deficit of $25 million to $30 million. That timeline meant most of the budget deliberations took place over the summer, when many faculty members were off contract and off campus.\n\n\nThe University of Oregon is not alone in struggling to implement shared governance. As many colleges around the country are working to close budget gaps, the question of what role faculty members should have in conversations about an institution’s future will emerge again.",

The amendment to the state’s education law requires these “coordinators” to ensure there is a centralized review, investigation and resolution process for alleged violations of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin, including shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. It also requires the state Division of Human Services to develop compliance training for students and employees that will be delivered annually.\n\n\nCUNY leadership says the university has already invested millions into doing the work to combat hate crimes and antisemitism.\n\n\nCUNY has invested more than $2 million to combat hate crimes and antisemitism, including mandatory Title VI training for its faculty and staff, Chancellor Felix Matos Rodriguez said in a statement included in Hochul’s announcement..\n\n\n“Every college is required to have a Chief Diversity Officer on campus who is responsible for addressing allegations of discrimination, including Title VI complaints,” CUNY spokesperson Noah Gardy told THE CITY in a written statement. “CUNY will work with all the campuses to ensure that a Title VI coordinator is in place to comply with the law, which goes into effect next year.”\n\n(Also touches on Hunter College Job ad, former Chief Judge of New York Jonathan Lippman’s report, and the governor’s view on the definition from IRHA of antisemitism.\n\nStudents Report Less Tolerance for Controversial Speakers\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/free-speech/2025/09/09/tolerance-controversial-campus-speakers-declines\n\nCollege students—particularly those who identify as conservative—are less likely to tolerate controversial speech than they were last year, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression’s annual survey.\n\n\nBut changes on both issues were driven primarily by conservative students’ decreased willingness to allow controversial speech on campus; liberal students reported a level of tolerance similar to previous years.

They allege they faced retaliation for whistleblowing and other protected activity.\n\n\nThey both specifically allege that Matthew Memoli—who was NIH’s acting director after Trump returned to power and is now NIH’s principal deputy director—retaliated against them. An NIH spokesperson said in an email Friday that Memoli emphasizes that each vaccine “must be assessed on its own merits.”\n\n\nNIH Cuts Mean Job Losses in College Towns\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/09/11/nih-cuts-mean-job-losses-college-towns\n\nNew report from the Brookings Institution shows that National Institutes of Health funding increases can boost labor markets in college towns. But if Trump’s proposed budget cuts takes effect, some will lose thousands of jobs.\n\n\nIn 2024, the federal agency spent $26 billion of its $47 billion budget on research grants to more than 500 higher education institutions or their affiliated research centers. The paper found that about 80 percent of the NIH’s budget goes to cities where universities with large medical facilities account for a significant share of the local economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nED Rule-Making Agenda Includes Accreditation, Title VI\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/08/ed-rule-making-agenda-includes-accreditation-title-vi\n\nChanging the interpretation of race-based discrimination, increasing flexibility within the college accreditation system and reworking the process to yank federal financial aid eligibility for certain civil rights violations are top priorities for Linda McMahon and the Department of Education, according to the agency’s rule-making agenda released Thursday.\n\n\nCivil Rights Investigations: The department is attempting to amend the rules that govern how the Office for Civil Rights enforces Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination based on race and national origin, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex-based discrimination.\n\n\nSpecifically, officials wrote that they want to streamline “the process by which OCR seeks termination of Federal financial assistance to institutions that intentionally violate Federal civil rights laws and refuse to voluntarily come into compliance.”\n\n\nEliminating Disparate Impact Theory: This legal theory, codified into law in 1991, states that even if a policy or practice is seemingly neutral, it can be declared discriminatory if it disproportionately harms a specific group of people. The Trump administration is attempting to repeal that theory.\n\n\nAccreditation: The department wants to change the regulations for accreditation to clarify a college’s ability to change accreditors and to make it easier for the department to recognize new accreditors.\n\n\nTitle IV Eligibility: The department wants to change the rules to make it easier for certain for-profit and religious institutions to access federal student aid.\n\n\nMcMahon to Higher Ed Leaders: Join Us to ‘Make Higher Ed Great Again’\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/09/09/mcmahon-dings-university-leaders-cites-hillsdale\n(The woman who wants to bring everyone A1 …)\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon denounced higher education as broken in a speech Monday at Hillsdale College in Michigan, directing her remarks primarily at four-year institutions and pitching her vision for how to improve American colleges and universities.\n\n\nMcMahon largely directed her speech to college leaders, arguing that “the crisis of higher education is first and foremost a crisis of leadership.” She called on them to work with the Trump administration to “make higher education great again.”\n\n\nShe wants to see a system of higher education that’s rigorous and prepares students for a career, but is also dedicated to truth-seeking and committed to treating institutions as “repositories of our civilizational inheritance,” according to a transcript of her remarks. She raised concerns about colleges allegedly taking “real American history” out of the curriculum and questioned whether tax dollars should go to institutions that detract from “our nation’s strength.”\n\n\nMcMahon’s stop at Hillsdale is part of her nationwide Returning Education to the States tour.\n\n(Hillsdale is a safe space to dismantle education)\n\nRoss Mugler, acting president of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, and others said McMahon’s comments “misrepresent the reality on college campuses today” and reflect an “unrealistic approach and assessment of higher education in this country.” … “Higher ed isn’t broken; it’s adapting,” he said.\n\n\nTrump Administration Takes Next Step in Dismantling ED\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/09/09/trump-administration-takes-next-step-dismantling-ed\n\nThe Trump administration has taken another step toward dismantling the Department of Education, creating a new integrated “state plan portal” that will allow the Department of Labor to jointly administer adult education programs with ED.\n\n\n“To prepare our next generation of American workers, the Trump Administration is taking decisive action to streamline unnecessary bureaucracy and advance the skills needed to fill jobs of the future,” Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a news release.\n\n\n“Donald Trump and Linda McMahon are continuing their attempts to illegally dismantle the Department of Education—and they are risking critical career and technical and adult education programs,” Democratic Senators Patty Murray and Tammy Baldwin, and Democratic Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro said in a statement. “Linda McMahon and Donald Trump need to follow the plain text of the law—period. Republicans should join us in insisting that the laws we pass get followed—and to stand up for students and families nationwide in the face of this administration’s continued attacks on our public education system.”\n\n\nEducation Department ends some aid aimed at minority college students\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/09/10/trump-grants-minority-students-college/\n\nThe Trump administration said Wednesday that it will withhold $350 million in grants to hundreds of colleges that serve large populations of minority students, calling the decades-old programs discriminatory.\n\n\nThe Education Department said it would cease funding eight discretionary grant programs that individually support Black, Native, Hispanic and Asian American students across the country.\n\n\n“Ripping away these resources at the tail end of the fiscal year is yet another example of how President Trump is putting politics ahead of students,” Sen. Patty Murray (Washington), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/09/11/education-department-moves-end-msi-programs\n(Also)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/us/politics/linda-mcmahon-federal-grants-colleges-universities.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n“These are longstanding programs that Congress has authorized and provided funding for on an annual basis that the Trump administration — empowered by the yearlong slush fund spending bill passed in March — is unilaterally deciding to eliminate funding for at the end of the year,” Ms. Murray [Senator Patty Murray of Washington] said in a statement. “This is another important reminder of why Congress needs to pass funding bills, like the one the Senate marked up this summer, that ensure Congress — not Donald Trump or Linda McMahon — decides how limited taxpayer dollars are spent.”",

    "text": "NYTimes: What Has the Trump Administration Gotten From Law Firms and Universities?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/06/us/trump-deals-law-firms-universities-concessions.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nNYTimes: We Are Watching a Scientific Superpower Destroy Itself\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/opinion/universities-science-trump-china.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nWe are currently governed by a leader indifferent to scientific consensus if it contradicts his political or economic interests, hostile to immigrants and intent on crippling the research universities that embody our collective hope for the future. The menace now is within. And with very few exceptions, the leaders of American universities have done little more than duck and cover.\n\n\nIn 1958, by a bipartisan vote, Congress passed and President Dwight Eisenhower signed the National Defense Education Act, one of the most consequential federal interventions in education in the nation’s history. Together with the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, it made America into the world’s undisputed leader in science and technology.\n\n\nThe N.D.E.A. reflected the widespread realization that something had to be done in schools and universities besides teaching students to hide under their desks. The country urgently needed more trained physicists, chemists, mathematicians, aerospace engineers, electrical engineers, material scientists and a host of other experts in STEM fields, and the government grasped that to get them would take a massive infusion of money pumped into schools and universities: roughly $1 billion, the equivalent of more than $11 billion today.\n\n\nUntil 1962, recipients of N.D.E.A. funds had to sign an affidavit affirming that they did not support any organization that sought to overthrow the U.S. government. But in one of those moments in which the right policy is chosen for the wrong reason, Southern segregationists in Congress, worried that some of the funds might be used to further desegregation efforts, added a provision stipulating that no part of the act would allow the federal government to dictate school curriculum, instruction, administration or personnel.\n\n\nThese transformations wound up playing a significant role in my own career. When I went back to Yale for graduate work, the N.D.E.A. funded my Ph.D. The government was not under the illusion that studying Shakespeare was rocket science. But Title IV of the act, calling for an increase in the number of university professors, extended support to the humanities as well as the sciences. Sputnik had turned out to include me in its orbit.\n\n\nShould the Trump administration settle for one-time fines, universities, chastened by the threats of the past few months, may yet recover their footing. But if, as seems entirely possible, the administration is determined to reshape the intellectual life and values of faculty members and students alike, then such recovery will be impossible.\n\n\nWhy on earth would we abandon institutions that have genuinely made America great? Why would we squander the world’s admiration for this magnificent achievement of ours? Why would we put at risk laboratories that are working to cure cancers or perfecting artificial limbs or exploring deep space or testing the limits of artificial intelligence?\n\n\n\n\nAccreditors Venture Into the Microcredential Landscape\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/accreditation/2025/09/08/accreditors-venture-microcredential-landscape\n\nThe microcredential landscape is often called a “wild west” in higher ed circles.\n\n\nThe field is crowded with tens of thousands of program providers, in and outside of academia, online and in person. Short-term programs vary widely, from certificates to badges to boot camps, spanning weeks to months to over a year. And while some programs offer high returns, others yield little to none or insufficiently track outcomes.\n\n\nNow, two accrediting agencies are stepping into that murky terrain, hoping to bring some order—and branch out into a new market. Both the New England Commission of Higher Education and the Higher Learning Commission, which has been researching short-term programs for eight years, are gearing up to assess whether providers of these programs meet their standards.\n\n(MSCHE?)\n\n\n\n\nWhen the next Democratic President uses Donald Trump’s precedent to target campus conservatives or climate “deniers,” the right will be singing Harvard’s current fight song.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-harvard-judge-allison-burroughs-first-amendment-4c00709e?st=XuU53K&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(The WSJ almost gets it, but always trips on its bias)\n\nNYTimes: Settlement Talks Stall Between Harvard and the Trump Administration\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/06/us/politics/harvard-trump-negotiations-stall.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(The same bylines for some 3 months now trying to peddle a story with slant that only helps one side… Now the message they carry—settle or the terms will ge t worse)\n\nOne major reason is an emerging divide within the administration between aides eager to deliver President Trump a political victory by announcing a deal and those who contend the current framework is too favorable to Harvard. Some Trump advisers argue that one way to strengthen the agreement would be to subject Harvard to an independent monitor who would ensure compliance. Harvard has consistently opposed that idea.\n\n\nTalks have also slowed in recent weeks with Cornell University and Northwestern University, although the reasons are unclear.\n\n\nThe government’s tactics — cutting research grants, opening investigations and demanding hundreds of millions of dollars or more in settlement payments — have plunged campuses into financial and political crises. Some schools, like Columbia University, negotiated deals with the Trump administration.\n\n\nThe slowdown in talks with universities is a signal that the administration is still acclimating to the departure of May Mailman, who, as the White House’s senior policy strategist, was a driving force behind Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign. She stepped back from that position last month as part of a long-planned return home to Texas.\n\n(Huh? Perhaps they are slowing due to the illegality of the approach being declared in the courts?)\n\nA deal with Harvard was nearing the finish line only a month ago. [As reported just by these three writers]\n\n\nMr. Trump’s enthusiasm for an agreement has been clear since June, when he posted on social media that a “mindbogglingly historic” agreement with Harvard could be finalized within days.\n\n\nHarvard beat Trump in court. Here’s what could happen next.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/09/05/harvard-trump-funding-battle /\n\nThe challenges are unprecedented: They include a promised appeal in court, worry that the government will slow-walk restoring frozen research funds, threats to future grants, complicated settlement negotiations — and the prospect of another 3½ years of a hostile White House with a bevy of arrows in its quiver and a proven willingness to aim them at its opponents.\n\n\nHarvard Was Cleared To Get Some Federal Funds. Then DOGE Stepped In. | News | The Harvard Crimson\n\nhttps://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/9/8/doge-blocks-nih-grants/\n\nThe National Institutes of Health began allocating some grants to Harvard in July to comply with a federal court ruling. But Department of Government Efficiency officials have quietly blocked all the funds at the last mile, withholding money because the University has not reached a settlement, according to four people familiar with the matter, including NIH staff.\n\n\nThe NIH resumed issuing some grants in mid-July to schools, including Harvard, that had been barred from receiving federal dollars under April guidance, according to an internal memo obtained by The Crimson. But officials from DOGE, the government cost-cutting group, used their control over the NIH’s payment system to keep the money out of researchers’ hands.\n\n\nThe extent of DOGE’s role in quietly obstructing NIH grant disbursements to universities — even after the agency was legally compelled to begin restoring some awards in July — has not been previously reported. And it suggests that, even in the absence of a formal stay or injunction, DOGE may use its power over federal payments to continue to quietly sidestep the Wednesday ruling that directs the Trump administration to reinstate the more than $2.7 billion in federal grants to Harvard that the administration froze or terminated in the spring.\n\n(Table By Saketh Sundar — Crimson Designer)\n\n\n\nUniversity\nSize of Freeze\nSettled?\nStatus of NIH Funds\n\n\n\n\nHarvard\n2.6 billion\nNo\nRestricted\n\n\nBrown\n510 million\nYes\nFlowing post-deal\n\n\nNorthwestern\n790 million\nNo\nRestricted**\n\n\nPenn\n175 million\nYes\nFlowing post-deal\n\n\nColumbia\n400 million\nYes\nFlowing post-deal\n\n\nUCLA\n584 million\nNo\nFlowing post-cut\n\n\nDuke\n108 million\nNo\nFlowing post-cut\n\n\nCornell\n1 billion\nNo\nPartially restricted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Harvard Can Out-Negotiate Trump | TIME\n\nhttps://time.com/7314798/harvard-can-out-negotiate-trump/\n(By leaders from Yale and past president of Dartmouth)\n\nPresident Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed great negotiator, has fumbled at the bargaining table once more.\n\n\nHe failed to intimidate India and China in trade talks, setting the stage for inflation to rise and for America’s greatest rivals to unite. His ingratiating groveling to Russian President Vladimir Putin was unable to bring about the ceasefire he promised—despite entering negotiations with the upper hand. Now, the “great negotiator” seems to have lost his cards again in his epic standoff with the world’s top-rated university.\n\n\nFor an administration that claims to be concerned about maintaining technological and scientific supremacy against international rivals, the political warfare on higher education makes no sense. As widely documented, American universities serve as the strongest engines for research, innovation, and economic growth. The direct, and indirect, economic impact of U.S. universities on the national GDP is significant and undeniable. Sectors that American schools underpin such as digital commerce, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence account for nearly half of the U.S. GDP, drive almost all GDP growth, and total twice the size of federal government spending.\n\n\nIn the context of America’s trade deficit, universities are a major export for the U.S., and one of the few sectors in which we have a large trade surplus. Universities, particularly through the influx of international students, contribute significantly to the U.S. trade surplus, with international students contributing $44 billion to the economy and the trade surplus in education accounting for about 15% of total U.S. services trade surplus—comparable to the combined exports of soybeans, coal, and natural gas.\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Is Told Research Money Could Flow Again, for Now\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/us/harvard-research-funding-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(The three writers on the Harvard beat who have been consistently premature, have this to add)\n\nThe Trump administration says it will restart the flow of federal research money to Harvard University, following a judge’s ruling that a sweeping blockade of funds was illegal, according to five people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The New York Times.\n\n\nHarvard received at least one letter this week from the Trump administration saying that hundreds of grants were being restored, according to a person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private correspondence. Individual researchers have begun receiving notices from the government about restored funding, including an astronomy professor, whose $3.7 million NASA grant seems to have been resurrected.\n\n\nIt is possible that funding will be disrupted again, even if the government begins making payments. The Justice Department, for example, could seek a stay of last week’s decision by Judge Allison D. Burroughs, who sits on the federal bench in Boston, and ask the court for permission to suspend the funding once again while its appeal proceeds.\n\n\nHarvard officials were surprised by the development, and unsure whether the White House knew that federal agencies seemed set to restore Harvard’s money, according to a person familiar with the university officials’ thinking. They wondered whether the West Wing would intervene to cut the funding off again.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: At George Mason University, Trump Has Found an Unbending Adversary\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/06/us/george-mason-university-gregory-washington-trump-attack.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(An “adversary”?)\n\nPresident Trump’s interpretation of the Civil Rights Act, historically aimed at protecting Black people and members of other minority groups from discrimination, has infuriated his critics. And as if to twist the knife, the Trump administration has also demanded a personal public apology from Dr. Washington over his efforts to support racial diversity — which it described as unlawful and discriminatory.\n\n\nThe refusal has made the George Mason president one of the few university leaders who has explicitly, and publicly, challenged the Trump administration. He joins a short list of other higher education leaders, including the presidents of Harvard and Princeton.\n\n\nBut unlike many of his peers, Dr. Washington has been targeted as an individual, and so his choice to resist the Trump administration’s demands leaves him in an uncommonly precarious position.\n\n\n“Singling out a Black leader in this way is not only unprecedented but also deeply troubling,” the university chapter of the American Association of University Professors said in a statement last week.\n\n(And they can write this without better phrasing, such as “Without reason…”)\n\nThe Trump administration has made attacking universities central to its agenda.\n\n\nThe Education Department’s assistant secretary for civil rights, Craig Trainor, upped the pressure in a statement last month, saying Dr. Washington “waged a university-wide campaign to implement unlawful D.E.I. policies that intentionally discriminate on the basis of race,” the statement said, adding, “You can’t make this up.”\n\n\n“They are literally investigating me for what they call offenses I made back in 2020, 2021 and that’s problematic,” he [GM President Washington] said. “It’s like changing the speed limit and charging you for speeding four years ago.”\n\n\nVirginia Democrats Accuse GMU Rector of Conflict of Interest\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/trustees-regents/2025/09/09/virginia-democrats-accuse-gmu-rector-conflict-interest\n\nVirginia Democrats want George Mason University board rector Charles Stimson to recuse himself from federal investigations into the university as well as discussions about the university president’s future, saying that his role at the Heritage Foundation, which recently released a report critical of GMU, presents a conflict of interest.\n\n\nThe letter comes almost two weeks after a state Senate committee blocked 14 gubernatorial appointments to university boards, including six at GMU, which left the Board of Visitors without a quorum. The letter also follows the Heritage report that accused GMU of attempting to hide diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Stimson has had several jobs at Heritage, where he’s currently deputy director of the organization’s legal and judicial studies center.\n\n\n“This creates an untenable ethical conflict where your employer’s published position is diametrically opposed to your duties as Rector,” the lawmakers wrote to Stimson.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/virginia-democrats-decry-george-mason-board-leaders-role-with-the-heritage-foundation\n\n\n\n\nThe world’s greatest mathematician avoided politics. Then Trump cut science funding.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/09/07/science-math-trump-federal-cuts-grants/\n\nA court order restored National Science Foundation grants, including Tao’s. But no new awards can be made, putting at risk the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), where he is director of special projects. Tao works in esoteric realms, which can lead to tangible real world benefits. For example, some of his work at IPAM has helped make MRI scans faster.\n\n\nBecause of previous delays in funding, I didn’t have enough money to fund my own summer salary. I was already delaying that for one month. And so, yeah, it’s still delayed, but that’s fine. I can take it. But IPAM, they didn’t have the reserves to operate for more than a few months. So basically, for the past two weeks or so, we’ve been in an emergency fundraising mode. I’ve been meeting with lots of donors.\n\n\nThe NSF grant that I had, I mean its primary purpose was to support my graduate students, give them the opportunity to travel to a conference, which is really important for career development at that stage,\n\n\nQ: If things do go back to normal, why does the uncertainty make a difference? A: In order to do the best science, you also need to have a somewhat tranquil mental state. Just to give it an analogy, suppose it’s a little bit chilly. It’s 60 degrees in your home, and so you set your heater to 72. But suppose that your thermostat suddenly changes the temperature to 100 degrees and then to 40 degrees and finally it’s back to 72 degrees. On paper, you now have the right temperature, but you’re not feeling too good after this. And somehow you can’t relax and sort of be productive, especially if you are worried that it’s going to do that again.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the U. of Chicago’s Financial Strains Are a Warning for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-the-u-of-chicagos-financial-strains-are-a-warning-for-higher-ed\n\nAnd then, just over a week ago, the university revealed a wide-ranging cost-saving plan aimed at reducing spending by $100 million, including: - a 30-percent reduction in its rate of tenure-track hiring - a 30-percent reduction in internally funded Ph.D. candidates by 2030–31 - a pause on certain new capital projects, along with a reduced footprint for the university’s planned engineering and science building - a staff reduction of 100–150 nonclinical employees - a 20-percent reduction in unrestricted funding toward campus centers Reviews of smaller programs are also planned.\n\n\nAlthough red ink isn’t new to the university — its academic operations have run operating deficits since 2011 — the scale of its deficits worsened sharply in late 2021-22, surging to over $225 million annually and coinciding with rising inflation rates. As for Chicago’s most recently completed fiscal year, which ended six months after the second inauguration of Donald Trump — heralding a dramatic shift in the federal government’s relationship with higher ed — President Paul Alivisatos told faculty the university’s annual income had once again fallen short of expenses.",

    "text": "Has Trump Ended Staten Island’s Wind Power Dreams?\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/09/staten-island-offshore-wind-trump/\n\nFor over a decade, New York has worked to bring wind power jobs to Staten Island as part of an ambitious plan to establish the state as the biggest hub of offshore wind. A centerpiece of the effort, situated in the southwest of the island, is the Arthur Kill Terminal (AKT), an envisioned staging and assembly port.\n\n\nBut on Friday, the Trump administration’s Department of Transportation rescinded a 2022 $48 million grant supporting the project that had been funded by President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\n\n“There’s a lot of money invested in this industry already, and these companies can’t take the hit.”\n\n\nThe construction of the facility would create 600 jobs, according to Charles Dougherty, AKT’s chief commercial officer, and once up and running, manufacturing work would sustain 100 to 150 jobs, all union. The project would also add nearly $400 billion in “direct economic impact” according to Empire State Development.\n\n\nBringing wind power to Staten Island, which has only voted for a Democrat presidential candidate four times in history, used to be a bipartisan project. Staten Island’s GOP representative, Nicole Malliotakis, has supported AKT, while boasting of the economic and environmental benefits of expanding wind power facilities in her district. She voted for Biden’s infrastructure package, and on Earth Day 2022 introduced legislation to create a program to share federal offshore wind revenue with states. In April, despite Trump’s order halting offshore wind development, Rep. Malliotakis petitioned the Army Corp of Engineers to nonetheless expedite the remaining federal permit for AKT. Her office did not respond to a request for comment, but after the Department of Transportation announced on Friday that it would pull its financial support of the terminal, Malliotakis told the Staten Island Advance she would push the agency “to get the funding repurposed to another maritime, port infrastructure or economic development project that would benefit Staten Island.”\n\n\nBeyond investments in infrastructure, local officials also worked to build the island’s workforce. Beginning in 2023, New York City’s Economic Development Corporation gave over half a million to the College of Staten Island to “train the next generation of professionals for offshore wind careers.” The day before the 2024 election, AKT provided the college another $1 million to develop a future offshore wind industry workforce.\n\n\nNYTimes: Happy Birthday, LIGO. Now Drop Dead.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/10/science/gravitational-waves-ligo-black-holes.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIt’s been 10 years since astronomers first felt the universe tremble.\n\n\nThe whole encounter lasted one-fifth of a second. But that instant changed astrophysics, opening a window onto previously inaccessible realms of nature in which space could rip, bend, puff up, crumple and even vanish.\n\n\nIt was the first direct proof that ripples in space-time, predicted by Albert Einstein a century earlier, actually existed. In the decade since, LIGO and other experiments have logged more than 300 of these violent collisions, providing astronomers with clues regarding the evolution of black holes across cosmic history.\n\n\n…President Trump has proposed slashing LIGO’s operating budget in 2026 by 40 percent, to $29 million from $48 million, and eliminating one of the antennas. That could spell disaster, as it takes two antennas to triangulate the origins of gravitational waves.\n\n\nThe impact on performance and future upgrades would be devastating, he [David Reitze, a physicist at Caltech and director of the LIGO Laboratory] added: “It would be nearly impossible for LIGO to recover from a cut of this magnitude.”\n\n\nThe Rise of ‘Conspiracy Physics’\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/science/physics/the-rise-of-conspiracy-physics-dd79fe36?st=9CAcc5\n\nThis resentment of scientific authority figures is the major attraction of what might be called “conspiracy physics.” Most fringe theories are too arcane for listeners to understand, but anyone can grasp the idea that academic physics is just one more corrupt and self-serving establishment. The German physicist Sabine Hossenfelder has attracted 1.72 million YouTube subscribers in part by attacking her colleagues: “Your problem is that you’re lying to the people who pay you,” she declared. “Your problem is that you’re cowards without a shred of scientific integrity.”",

    "text": "States face massive new costs under Trump budget cuts\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/08/states-medicaid-snap-cuts-trump/\n\nStates are scrambling to prepare for an unprecedented shift of costs and responsibilities under President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and spending plan, which will force them to make difficult decisions about cuts to state programs to offset the new financial burdens.\n\n\nUnlike the federal government, states must balance their budgets each year. That means deep cuts and changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will require state legislatures and governors to cope with hundreds of millions of dollars in new costs each year.\n\n\nThe changes mean that about 10 million fewer people are expected to have health insurance over the next decade and 2.4 million fewer people are expected to participate in SNAP during an average month, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\nThe bill also sharply limits the provider tax, which states collect from hospitals and other providers to boost Medicaid payments and receive federal matching funds. The change, along with others in the bill, will cause an additional $366 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending, according to the CBO.\n\n\nThe Washington Post conducted a survey of all 50 states and the District of Columbia about how much they expected to incur in additional costs from the Republican bill, how many residents are expected to lose health care and access to food stamps, and what services might be cut as a result. Only 15 states and D.C. replied, with responses that varied largely along partisan lines. … Three GOP-led states — Arkansas, Ohio and North Dakota — said they did not anticipate cuts to other programs as a result of Medicaid and SNAP changes … Democratic-run states say the effects of the federal cutbacks will be severe, and several Democratic governors have said there is no way for states to backfill the scale of the cuts.",
