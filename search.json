Thanks TR)\n\nHowever, the Trump administration is weaponizing these legitimate investigations as a pretext for an unprecedented federal attack on higher education. The administration’s recent actions—including its letter to Columbia University’s Board of Trustees and its illegal detention and threatened deportation of a student green card holder who has not been charged with a crime—go far beyond enforcing civil rights law. These measures threaten free speech, due process, and the very foundations of inquiry and unrestricted exploration of ideas on which academic institutions are built.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeachers College (Thanks CW)\n\nhttps://connect.tc.columbia.edu/emailviewonwebpage.aspx?erid=31352001&trid=9d7252b8-ce40-4517-ab56-82b2a86577c3\n\n\n\n\nAdd John Jay to the list of campuses speaking out about academic freedom violations by endorsing the UFS Letter in Defense of Academic Freedom.\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/my5g55jprx5o64r4vzus0/AO9WLNUUIorJRhgTO1SupgY?rlkey=zvsqtp7ev781y4rqqjti8xaho&e=1&dl=0\n\n\n\n\nOhio Budget Bill Could Enact Even More Higher Ed Changes\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/08/ohio-budget-bill-could-enact-even-more-higher-ed-changes\n\nThe latest version of an Ohio state budget bill includes numerous provisions that could impact public colleges and universities—including a line saying that, in curricular decisions, all feedback by a faculty senate, “or comparable representative body, is advisory.”\n\n\nHouse Bill 96 stresses that institutions’ boards of trustees would have the “final, overriding authority to approve or reject any establishment or modification” of any “courses, general education requirements, and degree programs.” It also stresses that boards would have “unilateral and ultimate authority to establish new academic programs, schools, colleges, institutes, departments, and centers.”\n\n\nSara Kilpatrick, executive director of the Ohio Conference of the American Association of University Professors, said it’s already “ultimately under the boards’ responsibilities to have the final say in really anything.” But, she said, “I think that this is specifically language that’s designed to sideline faculty and to potentially politicize program and curriculum offerings.”\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Book, “White Too Long,” Banned from US Naval Academy\n\nhttps://www.whitetoolong.net/p/my-book-white-too-long-banned-from?utm_campaign=post&showWelcomeOnShare=true\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Judge Permanently Bars N.I.H.

After initially barring the Trump administration from implementing the change in February, she extended her order twice while the lawsuit played out.\n\n\nNYTimes: The N.E.H.

DOGE Slashed It Anyway.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/opinion/humanities-cuts-tennessee-neh-doge.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe N.E.H. is one of the least-known of the federal agencies, but its work reaches a huge number of Americans, including those in Republican districts. It awards grants that fund research fellowships, programs at museums and historic sites, website development and documentary filmmaking, among a host of other projects related to the public humanities. But it also disburses a great chunk of its appropriation — some $65 million of an annual budget of roughly $210 million — directly to nonprofit humanities councils in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and five territories.\n\n\nStaff cuts begin at NEH, threatening humanities programs across U.S.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2025/04/10/neh-staff-cuts-reduction-in-force/\n\nTrump Presents Harvard With an Ultimatum for Federal Funds\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/04/trump-sets-demands-harvard-must-meet-regain-federal\n\nThe ultimatum came just three days after the president’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism notified the university it had been placed under review for its alleged failure to protect Jewish students and faculty from discrimination. If the case follows the precedent set at other universities, Harvard and its affiliate medical institutions could lose up to $9 billion in federal grants and contracts if they do not comply.\n\n\nSources say the move is driven less by true concern about antisemitism on campus than by the government’s desire to abolish diversity efforts and hobble higher ed institutions it deems too “woke.” This week alone, the administration has retracted funds from Brown and Princeton Universities. Before that, it targeted the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University and opened dozens of civil rights investigations at other colleges, all of which are ongoing.\n\n(Also https://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-demands-harvard-eradicate-dei-to-preserve-its-federal-funding)\n\nNYTimes: Columbia’s Former Leader Faced Contentious Interview After Resigning\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/nyregion/columbia-president-armstrong-federal-deposition.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe hearing transcript provided an inside glimpse of the tension between Columbia and representatives of the Trump administration’s multiagency antisemitism task force, which is investigating at least 10 universities in an effort to root out what it sees as disturbing antisemitic activity on campuses.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Freezes $1 Billion for Cornell and $790 Million for Northwestern, Officials Say\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/cornell-northwestern-university-funds-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe moves are the latest and largest in a rapidly escalating campaign against elite American universities that has resulted in billions in federal funds being suspended or put under review in just over a month. Other schools that have had funds threatened include Brown, Columbia, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton.\n\n\nNorthwestern, a Big Ten university, is the first non-Ivy League school to have funding from the Trump administration targeted under investigations of alleged discrimination. The university issued a “progress report” last week that highlighted its efforts to protect Jewish students, including mandatory antisemitism training for all students, faculty and staff.\n\nAlso reported on here\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-team-to-freeze-nearly-2-billion-at-cornell-and-northwestern-universities-2e13a88a?st=BJbjFN&reflink=article_gmail_share\nand elsewhere\n\nNYTimes: Trump Has Targeted These Universities. Why?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nCritics of the administration have not hesitated to point out that all of those schools are in states — or, in George Washington’s case, a federal district — that voted for the Democratic ticket in 2024.\n\n\nThrough emails and social media, colleges discover federal funds are frozen\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/11/elite-colleges-trump-federal-funding-freeze-email/\n\nNSF, NIH Slash Support for Early-Career Scientists\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/10/nsf-nih-slash-support-early-career-scientists\n\nOn Tuesday, Nature reported the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program awarded 1,000 fellowships—fewer than half of the record-setting 2,555 fellowship offers it made in 2023, and the second-smallest number of awards since 2008.\n\n\nOver the past two weeks, the NIH has also canceled numerous institutional and individual training grants, including many that support scientists from underrepresented communities, according to The Transmitter.\n\n\nNIH Freezes Millions More in Funding for Columbia\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/09/nih-freezes-millions-more-funding-columbia\n\nBut after the university agreed to enact various reforms the Trump administration demanded to address alleged antisemitism on campus, it appeared a reprieve was in order. Education Secretary Linda McMahon said last month that she believed Columbia was “on the right track” toward final negotiations to unfreeze the research funds.\n\n\nInstead, the Trump administration has gone in the opposite direction, cutting off even more research funding. According to Science, the NIH froze Columbia’s funding Monday at the direction of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH is reportedly not only blocking new funding but also ceasing payments for work on existing projects. In addition, the agency will require prior approval to tap existing disbursements.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: When Trump Is Done, What Will Remain of Public Education?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/opinion/trump-k-12-education.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nA longer piece on the history of the DOE and education in US history\n\nAmerica’s story is one of progress, which has rarely been obtained simply through good will. It has to be enforced. Fights for equality have been messy, and quite bloody at times. Understanding that history is important so as not to repeat it. Still, shortly before leaving office in 2020, Mr. Trump established the President’s Advisory 1776 Commission, in part a rebuttal to the 1619 Project, as a way for the administration to write its own version of American history.\n\n\nThe president’s vision to take a sledgehammer to the Department of Education’s ability to function will cause student suffering. The founders believed that education was critical to the full experience of citizenship; it was where students learned arts, sciences, humanities and how to engage with one another. But putting that vision into place left the nation with a system where inequities — in content and classroom composition — were left in place.\n\n\nAmerica began to undo those inequities, and the department protected that progress. Now, less than three months into Mr. Trump’s second presidency, the administration has done everything in its power, and some things beyond its authority, to ensure we are equal no more.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump cancels dozens of international student visas at UC, Stanford - Los Angeles Times\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-05/trump-administration-cancels-international-student-visas-university-of-california-stanford\n\nAt UC San Diego, Chancellor Pradeep Khosla said in a campus message late Friday that five students had their visas revoked. He said the university received the notification “without warning.” Khosla said a sixth student was “detained at the border, denied entry and deported to their home country.”\n\n\nA University of California statement said that “several” campuses had students who lost their visa status but did not offer more details.\n\n\nTrump Admin Broadens Scope of Student Visa Terminations\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/04/08/trump-admin-broadens-scope-student-visa\n\nInside Higher Ed uncovered dozens of visa terminations that have not been reported elsewhere, many of them at regional public universities and small private colleges.\n\n\nCUNY is not immune\n\nThere are reports that over 20 CUNY students have had SEVIS visa issues (Student and Exchange Visitor Program)\nhttps://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/education/2025/04/09/department-of-homeland-security-revokes-student-visas-at-cuny-and-fordham–schools-say\nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/09/trump-administration-cancels-dozens-of-student-visas-at-nyu-cuny-other-ny-schools/\n\nTracking Trump’s Actions on Student Visas\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-actions-on-student-visas\n\nWith secret moves against international students, feds spread fear\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/09/international-student-visas-revoked-trump-deportation-fears/\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Displays More Aggressive Posture in Dealing With Demonstrators\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/nyregion/columbia-security-protesters-removed.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nA new, more assertive stance was on display on Wednesday, as the university’s officers intervened to stop a daylong demonstration of students, most of whom were Jewish, who had chained themselves to the campus’s wrought-iron gates.\n\n\nMoving to end the protest, public safety officers cut or untangled the students from their chains at about 11:15 p.m., and then physically picked them up before escorting them from campus. The officers carried at least one student off the lawn, according to video posted on social media and student interviews.\n\n\nHow conservatives are using Columbia as a ‘test case’ to enforce Trump’s agenda\n\nhttps://wapo.st/43EUxWX\nThis is an important analysis of the playbook being employed and it references what appears to be another Chris Rufo type.\n\nCritical of college admissions, diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and campus protests that he lambasted as pro-Hamas, Max Eden, then a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote an outline that presaged what was to come in the new Trump administration. He singled out Columbia as the top target.\n\n\n “To scare universities straight,” Eden wrote in the Washington Examiner [https://www.aei.org/op-eds/a-comprehensive-guide-to-overhauling-higher-education/] , Education Secretary Linda McMahon “should start by taking a prize scalp. She should simply destroy Columbia University.”\n\n\nOn the day the administration canceled the federal funding to the school, a senior Trump administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, described Columbia as a “test case” for using funding to pressure colleges to comply with Trump’s ideology.\n\n\n“We’re going to bankrupt these universities,” Leo Terrell, leader of the recently formed Justice Department task force on antisemitism, said on Fox News after the cuts to Columbia were announced.\n\n\n“They are targeting private institutions of education and attempting to police and control speech, political expression and thought. And that is truly unprecedented,” said Orion Danjuma, counsel at Protect Democracy, which is representing the unions alongside the law firm Altshuler Berzon. “Columbia is the testing ground for this. It’s a canary in the coal mine.”\n\n\nOther changes are not an exact match to the administration’s demands. The university is not abolishing its judicial board that oversees disciplinary cases as requested. But it will remove students from participating and give the provost oversight. It is not putting the Middle East, South Asian and African Studies department in academic receivership for five years as the administration wanted. That academic department will undergo a review by the provost’s office.\n\n\n“This was planned,” said Reinhold Martin, president of Columbia’s chapter of the AAUP. “We’ve seen the script. The assault on Columbia is going according to that script.”\n\nAs for the Eden piece here are his talking points:\n\nCutting Off Federal Funding – Columbia was, perhaps, the worst offender in indulging the pro-Hamas campus radicals. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights should initiate a compliance review of every single decision Columbia made. To do that, OCR would need the identities of every single foreign student who supported the protests, actions the Trump administration could deem material support of a terrorist organization. Border czar Tom Homan could then revoke every single one of the foreign protesting students’ visas. If Columbia doesn’t cooperate, McMahon could cut off its research grant funding.\n\n\nRemoving Foreign Money from Higher Education – And while the Trump administration is looking into Columbia, the Justice Department should thoroughly explore indicting former Columbia President Lee Bollinger for fraud if he, through commission or omission, played a role in Columbia’s submission of inaccurate data to US News and World Report. Bollinger submitted the data to boost Columbia’s rank in the report. Once the true data were reported, Columbia’s rank fell from second to 18th. College presidents regard Bollinger as perhaps the greatest college leader of the 21st century. He should be regarded as the worst. Perhaps the college presidents could learn a valuable lesson from the sight of him in an orange jumpsuit.\n\n\nThe second target should be the University of California, Los Angeles. UCLA’s …\n\n\nEnforcing Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard; he first step should be forcing Harvard University to comply. Right after the decision was issued, Harvard all but publicly vowed to do everything in its power to violate the spirit of the Supreme Court’s ruling and the 14th Amendment on which it was based. McMahon should initiate a never-ending compliance review to ensure that Harvard follows the law. … If OCR finds a shred of evidence of racial discrimination, Harvard should lose its Title IV funds. I\n\n\nAnd so many other universities have essentially forfeited the privilege of picking their own professors.\n\n\nThe University of Washington and UIC should be forced to pay back wages to every single white applicant they declined to hire over a DEI statement and hire as many as would still like to work there. … However, it could demand all documents and correspondence on hiring in every university faculty department that implemented DEI statements. It could then train an artificial intelligence model to sort through the records and flag likely discrimination. Trump staffers could then send internal, FOIA-able correspondence regarding hot spots of likely discrimination. … Enterprising trial attorneys could team up with starving adjunct professors, and universities could be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement fees. That would teach them a painful lesson: Hiring based on race rather than academic merit comes at a very high cost.\n\n\nHow Trump can Destroy DEI on Campus – it’s all stereotyping. DEI violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment when stereotyping is institutionalized and promoted in an educational institution receiving federal funding — or so the Trump administration should hold and enforce. … To assure compliance with the 14th Amendment, McMahon could task accreditors with ensuring that students aren’t forced to take DEI-infused courses to graduate. This would, essentially, take Florida’s policy of removing DEI from general education requirements national. When students aren’t forced to take these courses, far fewer will, and the radical Marxists will lose students and influence. … McMahon could also champion college students’ First Amendment rights by forcing colleges to dismantle their so-called “Bias Reporting Systems.” More than half of colleges encourage students to snitch on each other for saying something “biased,” and students suspected of wrong speak are then hauled in front of a campus tribunal of DEI administrators.\n\n\nShaking Up College Accreditation – Trump suggested he would simply fire all the existing accreditors. That could prove prohibitively difficult. But Trump could easily decimate the worst of them: the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. … Trump could also easily expedite the approval of additional accreditors. These accreditors could provide a much more streamlined, cost-effective, outcomes-oriented paradigm than the existing set. They could also specialize in helping to launch new colleges, such as the University of Austin, and even newer ones that no one has dreamed up yet. Musk University? Thiel Technical College?\n\n\nA New Kind of Public College What about the American Academy? Experts laughed when Trump proposed launching a new, federally backed college. But former President George Washington wanted one. … At absolute minimum, the American Academy could offer a two-year, high-quality core curriculum, and sympathetic states could mandate their flagship universities accept transfer credit. The Universities of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the like could hoover up students who might otherwise have spent far bigger bucks on a private university with a similar prestige level.\n\n\nThese are just some ideas, and they’re just mine. And, of course, there’s far more the next Trump Education Department should and can do — it just wouldn’t be prudent to broadcast those ideas ahead of time, lest universities take defensive measures.\n\n\nTrump Administration Wants to Install Federal Oversight of Columbia University - The Wall Street Journal. (Thanks KB)\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-consent-decree-trump-federal-funding-2f4c4690?st=nRCE68\n\nA consent decree would be a major escalation of how the federal government normally resolves education-related civil-rights issues. Typically after federal lawyers investigate and find evidence that civil rights were violated, schools enter voluntary agreements to change their practices. The federal government has little ability to enforce such agreements. The Biden administration entered into such voluntary agreements over antisemitism concerns with Brown University and Rutgers.\n\n\nColumbia could fight the move in court; the Justice Department would need to prove that the arrangement is warranted. But a court case could take years, and Columbia would likely lose federal funding in the interim—and might ultimately lose. Opposing the move would also open the school up to required depositions and legal fact-finding, which could keep the school’s campus politics in the spotlight.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: A Playbook for Standing Up to President Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/opinion/trump-law-firms-universities.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThese institutions do not have to capitulate to Mr. Trump. They have a realistic path to defeating his intimidation.\n\n\nYes, Mr. Trump has adopted a more extreme approach to executive power in his second term. He has won some early policy victories, and he will win more. Nonetheless, he faces real constraints on his power. Indeed, the most likely path to American autocracy depends on not only a power-hungry president but also the voluntary capitulation of a cowed civil society. It depends on the mistaken belief that a president is invincible. Anybody who has dealt with a schoolyard bully should recognize this principle: The illusion of invincibility is often his greatest asset.\n\n\nNYTimes: Obama Calls for Universities to Stand Up for Core Values\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/obama-trump-college-speech.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, in a campus speech on Thursday, urged universities to resist attacks from the federal government that violate their academic freedom.\n\n\nHe also said schools and students should engage in self-reflection about speech environments on their campuses.\n\n\nEisgruber signals that Princeton will not make concessions (Thanks KB)\n\nhttps://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/04/princeton-news-adpol-eisgruber-university-concessions-bloomberg-interview\n\n“We would look at ways to potentially reallocate endowment funding, which would involve very difficult choices, but at the end of the day, what would happen here and elsewhere is that less research would get done, and that would be a bad thing,” he said.\n\n\nEisgruber also emphasized the need for universities to act together in response to governmental funding cuts.\n\n\n“I think it’s important for universities to stand shoulder to shoulder as we go forward,” he said.\n\nSee also this podcast\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-university-president-willing-to-fight-trump/id1200361736?i=1000702847509\n(which was shared by MOO to the mailing list)\n\nNYTimes: New York Warns Trump It Will Not Comply With Public School D.E.I.

He has mobilized dozens of professors from across the country to track on his website criticalrace.org hundreds of social-justice statements, staff diversity trainings, and courses he says indoctrinate students with false ideas about American racism. His site has been cited more than 170 times by mainstream-media outlets.\n\n\nThe Legal Insurrection Foundation, Jacobson’s nonprofit, collected $1.2 million in revenue from donations and grants in 2023, according to tax filings. It’s not clear who has donated to his cause.\n\n\nThis past December, Jacobson filed a complaint to OCR against the University of Rhode Island for offering more than 31 scholarships exclusively given to minority students. Mentioned in the complaint was the Miya Brophy-Baermann scholarship, which provides $1,500 to speech-language-pathology students who are racial minorities, men, or the first in their families to attend college.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: America’s Brightest Minds Will Walk Away\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/opinion/young-american-scientists.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMany young researchers say they are having to choose between staying in the United States and staying in science.

But on this one point, Donald Trump wants no ambiguity: “My promise to Jewish Americans is this,” he said on the campaign trail. “With your vote, I will be your defender, your protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.”\n\n\nAs the first Jewish president of a formerly Methodist university, I find no comfort in the Trump administration’s embrace of my people, on college campuses or elsewhere. Jew hatred is real, but today’s anti-antisemitism isn’t a legitimate effort to fight it. It’s a cover for a wide range of agendas that have nothing to do with the welfare of Jewish people.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Vandalism of Muslim Prayer Room at N.Y.U.

It’s almost impossible to start a new university today largely because of our accreditation system. And universities that underperform are allowed to go on underperforming with few consequences,” he said.\n\n\n(Speculation is rife that an executive order reshaping accreditation will be issued this month.)\n\n\nFirst, he argued for the need to reorient the enforcement of civil rights on campus, which he said the department has begun to do by holding universities accountable for harassment, discrimination and specifically antisemitism.\n\n\nPidluzny also said that ED must “reorient federal investments away from ideology, back to the advancement of learning and teaching excellence”\n\n\nAnd he argued for a “new vision” of funding universities and holding them accountable.\n\n\nLinks: Some of these links are available to CUNY faculty, not all.

From Limiting Medical Research Funding\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/nih-medical-research-funding.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nJudge Kelley had consistently agreed, ruling repeatedly that the policy appeared unnecessarily reckless and would inflict serious harm on important medical research. After initially barring the Trump administration from implementing the change in February, she extended her order twice while the lawsuit played out.\n\n\nNYTimes: The N.E.H. Does What Republicans Always Wanted. DOGE Slashed It Anyway.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/opinion/humanities-cuts-tennessee-neh-doge.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe N.E.H. is one of the least-known of the federal agencies, but its work reaches a huge number of Americans, including those in Republican districts. It awards grants that fund research fellowships, programs at museums and historic sites, website development and documentary filmmaking, among a host of other projects related to the public humanities. But it also disburses a great chunk of its appropriation — some $65 million of an annual budget of roughly $210 million — directly to nonprofit humanities councils in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and five territories.\n\n\nStaff cuts begin at NEH, threatening humanities programs across U.S.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2025/04/10/neh-staff-cuts-reduction-in-force/\n\nTrump Presents Harvard With an Ultimatum for Federal Funds\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/04/trump-sets-demands-harvard-must-meet-regain-federal\n\nThe ultimatum came just three days after the president’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism notified the university it had been placed under review for its alleged failure to protect Jewish students and faculty from discrimination. If the case follows the precedent set at other universities, Harvard and its affiliate medical institutions could lose up to $9 billion in federal grants and contracts if they do not comply.\n\n\nSources say the move is driven less by true concern about antisemitism on campus than by the government’s desire to abolish diversity efforts and hobble higher ed institutions it deems too “woke.” This week alone, the administration has retracted funds from Brown and Princeton Universities. Before that, it targeted the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University and opened dozens of civil rights investigations at other colleges, all of which are ongoing.\n\n(Also https://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-demands-harvard-eradicate-dei-to-preserve-its-federal-funding)\n\nNYTimes: Columbia’s Former Leader Faced Contentious Interview After Resigning\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/nyregion/columbia-president-armstrong-federal-deposition.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe hearing transcript provided an inside glimpse of the tension between Columbia and representatives of the Trump administration’s multiagency antisemitism task force, which is investigating at least 10 universities in an effort to root out what it sees as disturbing antisemitic activity on campuses.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Freezes $1 Billion for Cornell and $790 Million for Northwestern, Officials Say\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/cornell-northwestern-university-funds-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe moves are the latest and largest in a rapidly escalating campaign against elite American universities that has resulted in billions in federal funds being suspended or put under review in just over a month. Other schools that have had funds threatened include Brown, Columbia, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton.\n\n\nNorthwestern, a Big Ten university, is the first non-Ivy League school to have funding from the Trump administration targeted under investigations of alleged discrimination. The university issued a “progress report” last week that highlighted its efforts to protect Jewish students, including mandatory antisemitism training for all students, faculty and staff.\n\nAlso reported on here\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-team-to-freeze-nearly-2-billion-at-cornell-and-northwestern-universities-2e13a88a?st=BJbjFN&reflink=article_gmail_share\nand elsewhere\n\nNYTimes: Trump Has Targeted These Universities. Why?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nCritics of the administration have not hesitated to point out that all of those schools are in states — or, in George Washington’s case, a federal district — that voted for the Democratic ticket in 2024.\n\n\nThrough emails and social media, colleges discover federal funds are frozen\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/11/elite-colleges-trump-federal-funding-freeze-email/\n\nNSF, NIH Slash Support for Early-Career Scientists\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/10/nsf-nih-slash-support-early-career-scientists\n\nOn Tuesday, Nature reported the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program awarded 1,000 fellowships—fewer than half of the record-setting 2,555 fellowship offers it made in 2023, and the second-smallest number of awards since 2008.\n\n\nOver the past two weeks, the NIH has also canceled numerous institutional and individual training grants, including many that support scientists from underrepresented communities, according to The Transmitter.\n\n\nNIH Freezes Millions More in Funding for Columbia\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/09/nih-freezes-millions-more-funding-columbia\n\nBut after the university agreed to enact various reforms the Trump administration demanded to address alleged antisemitism on campus, it appeared a reprieve was in order. Education Secretary Linda McMahon said last month that she believed Columbia was “on the right track” toward final negotiations to unfreeze the research funds.\n\n\nInstead, the Trump administration has gone in the opposite direction, cutting off even more research funding. According to Science, the NIH froze Columbia’s funding Monday at the direction of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH is reportedly not only blocking new funding but also ceasing payments for work on existing projects. In addition, the agency will require prior approval to tap existing disbursements.",

It has to be enforced. Fights for equality have been messy, and quite bloody at times. Understanding that history is important so as not to repeat it. Still, shortly before leaving office in 2020, Mr. Trump established the President’s Advisory 1776 Commission, in part a rebuttal to the 1619 Project, as a way for the administration to write its own version of American history.\n\n\nThe president’s vision to take a sledgehammer to the Department of Education’s ability to function will cause student suffering. The founders believed that education was critical to the full experience of citizenship; it was where students learned arts, sciences, humanities and how to engage with one another. But putting that vision into place left the nation with a system where inequities — in content and classroom composition — were left in place.\n\n\nAmerica began to undo those inequities, and the department protected that progress. Now, less than three months into Mr. Trump’s second presidency, the administration has done everything in its power, and some things beyond its authority, to ensure we are equal no more.",

The officers carried at least one student off the lawn, according to video posted on social media and student interviews.\n\n\nHow conservatives are using Columbia as a ‘test case’ to enforce Trump’s agenda\n\nhttps://wapo.st/43EUxWX\nThis is an important analysis of the playbook being employed and it references what appears to be another Chris Rufo type.\n\nCritical of college admissions, diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and campus protests that he lambasted as pro-Hamas, Max Eden, then a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote an outline that presaged what was to come in the new Trump administration. He singled out Columbia as the top target.\n\n\n “To scare universities straight,” Eden wrote in the Washington Examiner [https://www.aei.org/op-eds/a-comprehensive-guide-to-overhauling-higher-education/] , Education Secretary Linda McMahon “should start by taking a prize scalp. She should simply destroy Columbia University.”\n\n\nOn the day the administration canceled the federal funding to the school, a senior Trump administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, described Columbia as a “test case” for using funding to pressure colleges to comply with Trump’s ideology.\n\n\n“We’re going to bankrupt these universities,” Leo Terrell, leader of the recently formed Justice Department task force on antisemitism, said on Fox News after the cuts to Columbia were announced.\n\n\n“They are targeting private institutions of education and attempting to police and control speech, political expression and thought. And that is truly unprecedented,” said Orion Danjuma, counsel at Protect Democracy, which is representing the unions alongside the law firm Altshuler Berzon. “Columbia is the testing ground for this. It’s a canary in the coal mine.”\n\n\nOther changes are not an exact match to the administration’s demands. The university is not abolishing its judicial board that oversees disciplinary cases as requested. But it will remove students from participating and give the provost oversight. It is not putting the Middle East, South Asian and African Studies department in academic receivership for five years as the administration wanted. That academic department will undergo a review by the provost’s office.\n\n\n“This was planned,” said Reinhold Martin, president of Columbia’s chapter of the AAUP. “We’ve seen the script. The assault on Columbia is going according to that script.”\n\nAs for the Eden piece here are his talking points:\n\nCutting Off Federal Funding – Columbia was, perhaps, the worst offender in indulging the pro-Hamas campus radicals. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights should initiate a compliance review of every single decision Columbia made. To do that, OCR would need the identities of every single foreign student who supported the protests, actions the Trump administration could deem material support of a terrorist organization. Border czar Tom Homan could then revoke every single one of the foreign protesting students’ visas. If Columbia doesn’t cooperate, McMahon could cut off its research grant funding.\n\n\nRemoving Foreign Money from Higher Education – And while the Trump administration is looking into Columbia, the Justice Department should thoroughly explore indicting former Columbia President Lee Bollinger for fraud if he, through commission or omission, played a role in Columbia’s submission of inaccurate data to US News and World Report. Bollinger submitted the data to boost Columbia’s rank in the report. Once the true data were reported, Columbia’s rank fell from second to 18th. College presidents regard Bollinger as perhaps the greatest college leader of the 21st century. He should be regarded as the worst. Perhaps the college presidents could learn a valuable lesson from the sight of him in an orange jumpsuit.\n\n\nThe second target should be the University of California, Los Angeles. UCLA’s …\n\n\nEnforcing Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard; he first step should be forcing Harvard University to comply. Right after the decision was issued, Harvard all but publicly vowed to do everything in its power to violate the spirit of the Supreme Court’s ruling and the 14th Amendment on which it was based. McMahon should initiate a never-ending compliance review to ensure that Harvard follows the law. … If OCR finds a shred of evidence of racial discrimination, Harvard should lose its Title IV funds. I\n\n\nAnd so many other universities have essentially forfeited the privilege of picking their own professors.\n\n\nThe University of Washington and UIC should be forced to pay back wages to every single white applicant they declined to hire over a DEI statement and hire as many as would still like to work there. … However, it could demand all documents and correspondence on hiring in every university faculty department that implemented DEI statements. It could then train an artificial intelligence model to sort through the records and flag likely discrimination. Trump staffers could then send internal, FOIA-able correspondence regarding hot spots of likely discrimination. … Enterprising trial attorneys could team up with starving adjunct professors, and universities could be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement fees. That would teach them a painful lesson: Hiring based on race rather than academic merit comes at a very high cost.\n\n\nHow Trump can Destroy DEI on Campus – it’s all stereotyping. DEI violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment when stereotyping is institutionalized and promoted in an educational institution receiving federal funding — or so the Trump administration should hold and enforce. … To assure compliance with the 14th Amendment, McMahon could task accreditors with ensuring that students aren’t forced to take DEI-infused courses to graduate. This would, essentially, take Florida’s policy of removing DEI from general education requirements national. When students aren’t forced to take these courses, far fewer will, and the radical Marxists will lose students and influence. … McMahon could also champion college students’ First Amendment rights by forcing colleges to dismantle their so-called “Bias Reporting Systems.” More than half of colleges encourage students to snitch on each other for saying something “biased,” and students suspected of wrong speak are then hauled in front of a campus tribunal of DEI administrators.\n\n\nShaking Up College Accreditation – Trump suggested he would simply fire all the existing accreditors. That could prove prohibitively difficult. But Trump could easily decimate the worst of them: the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. … Trump could also easily expedite the approval of additional accreditors. These accreditors could provide a much more streamlined, cost-effective, outcomes-oriented paradigm than the existing set. They could also specialize in helping to launch new colleges, such as the University of Austin, and even newer ones that no one has dreamed up yet. Musk University? Thiel Technical College?\n\n\nA New Kind of Public College What about the American Academy? Experts laughed when Trump proposed launching a new, federally backed college. But former President George Washington wanted one. … At absolute minimum, the American Academy could offer a two-year, high-quality core curriculum, and sympathetic states could mandate their flagship universities accept transfer credit. The Universities of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the like could hoover up students who might otherwise have spent far bigger bucks on a private university with a similar prestige level.\n\n\nThese are just some ideas, and they’re just mine. And, of course, there’s far more the next Trump Education Department should and can do — it just wouldn’t be prudent to broadcast those ideas ahead of time, lest universities take defensive measures.\n\n\nTrump Administration Wants to Install Federal Oversight of Columbia University - The Wall Street Journal. (Thanks KB)\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-consent-decree-trump-federal-funding-2f4c4690?st=nRCE68\n\nA consent decree would be a major escalation of how the federal government normally resolves education-related civil-rights issues. Typically after federal lawyers investigate and find evidence that civil rights were violated, schools enter voluntary agreements to change their practices. The federal government has little ability to enforce such agreements. The Biden administration entered into such voluntary agreements over antisemitism concerns with Brown University and Rutgers.\n\n\nColumbia could fight the move in court; the Justice Department would need to prove that the arrangement is warranted. But a court case could take years, and Columbia would likely lose federal funding in the interim—and might ultimately lose. Opposing the move would also open the school up to required depositions and legal fact-finding, which could keep the school’s campus politics in the spotlight.",

But on this one point, Donald Trump wants no ambiguity: “My promise to Jewish Americans is this,” he said on the campaign trail. “With your vote, I will be your defender, your protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.”\n\n\nAs the first Jewish president of a formerly Methodist university, I find no comfort in the Trump administration’s embrace of my people, on college campuses or elsewhere. Jew hatred is real, but today’s anti-antisemitism isn’t a legitimate effort to fight it. It’s a cover for a wide range of agendas that have nothing to do with the welfare of Jewish people.",

Sadly, there is too much to track faithfully.\nFor a great roundup of other actions taken, this opinion piece by Dana Millbank is recommended: https://wapo.st/4hwKarw.\n\n\n\nAcademic freedom statements issued after Governor Hochul demanded the removal of a job ad at Hunter College:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/my5g55jprx5o64r4vzus0/AO9WLNUUIorJRhgTO1SupgY?rlkey=zvsqtp7ev781y4rqqjti8xaho&dl=0\n(Shared by EI)\nRecent activity includes a statement by the faculty senates of Guttman, Medger Evers, the College of Staten Island, and Hostos.\n\nColumbia AAUP Urges University to Reject Trump’s Demands\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/19/columbia-aaup-urges-university-reject-trumps-demands\n\n“Compliance would make Columbia complicit in its own destruction, stripping shared control of academic and student affairs from the faculty and administration and replacing the deliberative practices and structures of the university with peremptory fiats from outside the institution,” the AAUP chapter said in a statement Tuesday. “We see no evidence that compliance would assuage the hostility of the White House.”\n\n\nThe Cost of the Government’s Attack on Columbia (Princeton President)\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/columbia-academic-freedom/682088/\n\nThe Trump administration’s recent attack on Columbia University puts all of that [best collection of research universities] at risk, presenting the greatest threat to American universities since the Red Scare of the 1950s. Every American should be concerned.\n\n\nThe second turning point [first was development of academic freedom] came during World War II, when Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, created the modern partnership between the federal government and the country’s research universities. Bush recognized that by sponsoring research at universities, the United States could lead the world in discoveries and innovations. Over time, American universities became responsible for a large portion of the government’s scientific programs, accepting tens of billions of dollars a year to perform research that would make the country stronger and improve the lives of its citizens.\n\n\nNobody should suppose that this will stop at Columbia or with the specific academic programs targeted by the government’s letter.\n\n\nColumbia nearing agreement to give trump what he wants\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-is-nearing-agreement-to-give-trump-what-he-wants-14315bb3?st=HNVvxe&reflink=article_copyURL_share\n\nDiscussions on the board of trustees are still fluid—with sticking points—and could turn in a different direction before Thursday.\n\n\nAgreement to the demands doesn’t guarantee the federal funds will come back. In a letter last week, the Trump administration said meeting its nine requests was a “precondition for formal negotiations.”\n\n\nPlan to strip U Penn of 175M in funding\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-to-pause-175-million-for-university-of-pennsylvania-over-transgender-policy.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAcademic Freedom Index: ‘serious concern’ for US universities (Paywall; Thanks BE)\n\nhttps://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/academic-freedom-index-serious-concern-us-universities\n\nCongress Eyes More Control Over Colleges\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/03/21/congress-eying-more-control-over-colleges\n\nthey’ve introduced bills to crack down on immigration and foreign influence by threatening student visas and restricting international donations; to hamper flexibility for borrowers by capping student loan amounts; and to suppress “liberal ideologies,” by establishing penalties for pro-Palestinian protests. Republicans are also escalating their ongoing attacks on wealthy colleges with proposals to significantly increase the tax on university endowments.\n\n\nAnd all of that doesn’t even take into account the possibility that Republicans could revive parts of the College Cost Reduction Act—a comprehensive piece of legislation introduced last Congress to overhaul higher education. Although the bill itself has yet to be introduced, many of its provisions—such as requiring colleges to pay back a portion of students’ unpaid loans—could be part of the forthcoming reconciliation bill, a top priority for Congressional Republicans this spring that could mean billions in cuts to higher education.\n\n\nNorthwestern Journalism Professor Says Pro-Palestinian Activism Cost Him Tenure\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/21/pro-palestinian-journalism-professor-denied-tenure\n\n“Shared Governance Is Crumbling”\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/shared-governance-is-crumbling\n\nAcademic freedom is about the freedom to choose: the freedom to research this problem and not that one, to consider or advance one argument in the classroom and to criticize another. But freedom of choice only means something if the choices themselves are meaningful. Part of how colleges and universities make sure faculty members’ choices have meaning is through shared governance. And shared governance is under attack.\n\n\nAs part of the ongoing legislative attack on academic freedom and campus free speech, state-level proposals to alter university governance and remove faculty from decision-making have bubbled up across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nCUNY Programming cut – a private funder (Thanks MP)\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/newsletter/private-funder-axes-cuny-diversity-initiative/\n\nThe country’s largest private funder of biomedical research has cut its funding for a program at Queens College that had focused on making science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education more inclusive and engaging for students of diverse backgrounds, the college confirmed to THE CITY.\n\n\nThe Inclusive Excellence initiative, launched at the Flushing-based CUNY college in 2022 with funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), ended abruptly last month when the Institute cut short what was supposed to be a $505,000, six-year grant running through 2028.\n\n\nByrd hoped that because the program wasn’t funded by the federal government, but privately, that it would continue on. An HHMI spokesperson declined to provide an explanation for why they pulled the plug.\n\n\n“The Authoritarian Endgame on Higher Education”\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/opinion/trump-research-cuts.html?unlocked_article_code=1.4E4.keqa.qHwBu9NLKbAp&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nAKA, why would one want to kill the golden goose of Higher Ed.\nAlso, CUNY faculty member amongst a trio on “A Really Easy Mark for Trump: Three Columnists on the Threats to Elite Colleges”:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/opinion/trump-research-cuts.html?unlocked_article_code=1.4E4.keqa.qHwBu9NLKbAp&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBetter to fight like men than die like cowards, or something like that\n\n\nAs I wrote above, this is a campaign of destruction. A Russian scholar I know wrote recently that he thought that Trump 2.0 would be like the Chinese Cultural Revolution, but it’s turning out to be more like the Russian Civil War — just utter devastation, the effects of which will be felt for generations.\n\n\nI think that university presidents need to gather together their administrators, faculty members and students — don’t forget the students! — and remind them of these values and call on them to unite to affirm them. This is a very hard thing to do while under attack, to get out of a defensive crouch and try to stand up and lead, but it could point the way forward, and not just for universities.\n\n\nDemands on Columbia to restore funding “Reflect Assault on Higher Ed”\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/03/14/trump-escalates-attack-columbia-his-latest-demands\nThese include: overhaul its discipline process, ban masks, expel some students, put an academic department under review, give its campus security “full law enforcement authority” and reform its admissions practices.\n\nImpact of funding cuts at Columbia\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/03/13/trumps-columbia-cuts-start-hitting-postdocs-professors\n\nImpact on hiring due to uncertainty on federal funding\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/business/cost-cutting/2025/03/14/more-colleges-freeze-hiring-amid-federal-funding-uncertainty\n\nNYU Administration letter to faculty\n\n(select excerpts; thanks KB)\n\nBased on recent federal actions, we’ve identified a number of financial risk areas for the University ranging from federal cuts to research funding to tariffs, as well as a range of other proposals that could affect our overall budget. We don’t yet know whether, when, or to what extent these or other measures may be enacted. In the meantime, we continue to vigorously advocate for robust federal support of higher education. Given the scale of potential outcomes, however, we need to address risks sooner than later.\n\n\nWe are implementing an administrative hiring freeze effective immediately. Th\n\n\nWe anticipate that salary increases for faculty and administrative staff will be lower than they have been in recent years.\n\n\nWe are asking schools and units to prepare contingency plans for more cuts at several levels, so we can respond nimbly should additional budget adjustments be required.\n\n\nWe do not want in any way to minimize the difficulties facing us, but neither will we embrace hopelessness. NYU—and its faculty, students, administrators, and staff—have navigated arduous moments before in our nearly 200-year history while preserving what is important, fulfilling our mission, supporting our community, sustaining our academic trajectory, and being good stewards of the University’s resources. We will do so again now.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Culture War Is No Longer Just a Culture War\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/opinion/trump-khalil-columbia-speech.html\n\nIn other words, universities possess a double obligation — to protect students and faculty and staff members from discrimination and harassment, while also protecting free expression on campus.

Every American should be concerned.\n\n\nThe second turning point [first was development of academic freedom] came during World War II, when Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, created the modern partnership between the federal government and the country’s research universities. Bush recognized that by sponsoring research at universities, the United States could lead the world in discoveries and innovations. Over time, American universities became responsible for a large portion of the government’s scientific programs, accepting tens of billions of dollars a year to perform research that would make the country stronger and improve the lives of its citizens.\n\n\nNobody should suppose that this will stop at Columbia or with the specific academic programs targeted by the government’s letter.\n\n\nColumbia nearing agreement to give trump what he wants\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-is-nearing-agreement-to-give-trump-what-he-wants-14315bb3?st=HNVvxe&reflink=article_copyURL_share\n\nDiscussions on the board of trustees are still fluid—with sticking points—and could turn in a different direction before Thursday.\n\n\nAgreement to the demands doesn’t guarantee the federal funds will come back.

Republicans are also escalating their ongoing attacks on wealthy colleges with proposals to significantly increase the tax on university endowments.\n\n\nAnd all of that doesn’t even take into account the possibility that Republicans could revive parts of the College Cost Reduction Act—a comprehensive piece of legislation introduced last Congress to overhaul higher education. Although the bill itself has yet to be introduced, many of its provisions—such as requiring colleges to pay back a portion of students’ unpaid loans—could be part of the forthcoming reconciliation bill, a top priority for Congressional Republicans this spring that could mean billions in cuts to higher education.\n\n\nNorthwestern Journalism Professor Says Pro-Palestinian Activism Cost Him Tenure\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/21/pro-palestinian-journalism-professor-denied-tenure\n\n“Shared Governance Is Crumbling”\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/shared-governance-is-crumbling\n\nAcademic freedom is about the freedom to choose: the freedom to research this problem and not that one, to consider or advance one argument in the classroom and to criticize another.

We don’t yet know whether, when, or to what extent these or other measures may be enacted. In the meantime, we continue to vigorously advocate for robust federal support of higher education. Given the scale of potential outcomes, however, we need to address risks sooner than later.\n\n\nWe are implementing an administrative hiring freeze effective immediately. Th\n\n\nWe anticipate that salary increases for faculty and administrative staff will be lower than they have been in recent years.\n\n\nWe are asking schools and units to prepare contingency plans for more cuts at several levels, so we can respond nimbly should additional budget adjustments be required.\n\n\nWe do not want in any way to minimize the difficulties facing us, but neither will we embrace hopelessness. NYU—and its faculty, students, administrators, and staff—have navigated arduous moments before in our nearly 200-year history while preserving what is important, fulfilling our mission, supporting our community, sustaining our academic trajectory, and being good stewards of the University’s resources.

Sadly another terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week. More tricks (re) employed: monkeying with grants; tax-exempt status; accreditation; student visas; and a Draconian proposed budget. Atleast it seems clear – resistance is the only means forward.\n\n\n\nSeveral CUNY senates have passed alliance resolutions\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/my5g55jprx5o64r4vzus0/ABqQBAimqk_KN5t-EsUG8Ds/1.Mutual%20Defense%20Statements?dl=0&rlkey=zvsqtp7ev781y4rqqjti8xaho&subfolder_nav_tracking=1\nThese include BMCC, CCNY, Hostos, Hunter, QBCC, and the UFS XC.

We look to you for leadership and coalition-building during a time when the stakes have never been higher.\n\n\nWe ask all sixty institutions under government threat to unite in a coordinated, proactive defense.\n\n(~3009 signatories)\n\nAdvocating for Brown – What’s at stake | Office of the President | Brown University\n\nhttps://president.brown.edu/president/advocating-brown-whats-stake\n\nIt’s important to share what is at stake for Brown. The research funding cuts that Brown has already suffered are causing immediate harm, forcing us to reconfigure our operations and budget to address funding shortfalls. Any long-term cuts of significant magnitude would imperil, or possibly end, several areas of high-impact research at Brown. This would be devastating to Brown’s research community, including the undergraduate, graduate and medical students we teach, and the people, patients and communities that benefit from the results of our research.\n\n\nEven more concerning, since early April, Brown has not been reimbursed for any expenses associated with active (i.e., not terminated) grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), whose grants make up roughly 70% of Brown’s overall research portfolio. Again, we have not been given any official explanation for why expenses for active grants are not being reimbursed. These unreimbursed expenses, which amount to millions of dollars per week, represent a significant threat to Brown’s financial sustainability and its ability to conduct federally funded research.\n\n\nAs we navigate the current environment, I continue to share a set of core principles:\n\n\nBrown will always defend the ability for students and scholars to teach and learn without fear of government intrusion or censorship, which is fundamental to efforts to protect academic freedom.\n\n\nBrown is deeply committed to following the law and maintaining an academic community where all can participate fully in the life of the institution. This means maintaining a campus that is free of all forms of harassment and discrimination for all community members, including addressing allegations of discrimination based on shared ancestry. We are proud of our initiatives to combat antisemitism, many of which we launched even before this became a major area of focus for the federal government.\n\n\nBrown will continue to provide resources and support to members of our international community.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Emerging From a Collective Silence, Universities Organize to Fight Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/27/us/trump-university-presidents.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nExclusive | Elite Universities Form Private Collective to Resist Trump Administration - WSJ\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/elite-universities-form-private-collective-to-resist-trump-administration-95a14ff3\n\nThe Resistance Is Here\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/29/resistance-here\n\nSince then [Harvard saying “no”], a group of more than 500 higher ed leaders signed a statement, released by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, opposing “undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses.” Presidents of highly selective universities, threatened by some of the most severe federal funding cuts, have reportedly developed a network to agree on shared boundaries and talk strategy. And faculty members at the Big Ten universities are ramping up pressure on their institutions to collaborate and defend one another against threats from the administration.\n\n\nMore and More Faculty Groups Want Their Colleges to Stand Together Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/more-and-more-faculty-groups-want-their-colleges-to-stand-together-against-trump\n\nFaculty senates across the nation are endorsing the idea of standing collectively against the actions of the Trump administration. Ten of the Big Ten’s 18 member institutions have adopted resolutions in recent weeks calling for an alliance among that group’s members, and on Saturday the State University of New York’s University Faculty Senate also endorsed a mutual-defense compact.\n\n\nWithin the City University of New York system, the Senates at Hunter College, Hostos Community College, and the City College of New York have done the same for a New York-based effort.\n\n\nSupport for mutual-defense compacts has come alongside several other efforts to stand against the Trump administration’s actions, among them the AAC&U statement condemning “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe, which now has been signed by more than 500 higher-ed leaders.\n\n\nPresidents and trustees from about 10 institutions have also formed an informal private collective to discuss possible responses to the administration, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The Journal did not name those institutions but noted that they included Ivy League campuses and top private research universities, primarily in blue states.\n\n\nA call for unity among researchers, libraries, publishers, journalists and the public in fighting the Trump administration.\n\nhttps://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2025/04/30/trump-v-research-how-we-could-turn-the-threats-into-opportunities/\n(Thanks BE!)\n\n“while it’s encouraging to see some organizations coming together within their existing siloes, that’s not enough. There’s a real opportunity – and imperative – for all stakeholders in the research community to join forces. Each group plays a vital role in the research endeavor. Now is the time to show our support for everyone’s contributions, and to help everyone understand that, by dismantling the research infrastructure through censorship and defunding, we hamper research progress and its benefits in the US and across the world.

When Mr. Trump began threatening the university with canceled funds this spring, many Harvard professors and students urged administrators to head straight to the ramparts and denounce him. Alan Garber, Harvard’s president, took a wiser approach. He acknowledged that some of Mr. Trump’s criticisms had merit. Harvard, like much of elite higher education, has, in fact, been blasé about antisemitism, and it has too often prioritized progressive ideology over an independent search for truth.\n\n\nBy admitting as much, Mr. Garber strengthened Harvard’s political position. He said what many Americans believed. But when the administration issued a list of ludicrous demands, Harvard fought back hard. It filed a lawsuit, with help from a legal team that included conservative litigators, and became a national symbol of resistance to his lawlessness. Mr. Garber made Harvard look reasonable and Mr. Trump unreasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Road Map of Trump’s Lawless Presidency, According to 35 Legal Scholars\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/opinion/trump-constitution-rule-of-law.html?unlocked_article_code=1.DE8.cUMD.AE-5Mjxg6jlf&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe disregard for law is itself part of the agenda.

You need to trace its roots in the 1960s, its evolution through the culture wars of the 1980s and ’90s, and into the current populist fray. Then you need to do something about it. Professors, administrators, students, and concerned citizens can no longer stand on the sidelines, shaking our heads and deploring the potentially devastating consequences. The simple truth is this: For decades, outside forces have — both consciously and unintentionally — undermined the integrity and quality of public higher education in America. And time and time again, a divided academic community has failed to combat them effectively. We can and must do better. Seeds of resistance are sprouting. Together, we must nurture their growth.

With labs, dormitories, lecture halls, athletic facilities, and so much else, colleges have exorbitant fixed costs. Those fixed costs have typically been covered in large part by student enrollment. Now that enrollment is declining, higher education’s cost curve is breaking. No amount of cutting will fix the underlying problem. Many colleges have masked their operating deficiencies by using Covid-relief funds in the past few years, but now, with those funds exhausted, they are dealing with a broken economic model. The Trump administration’s cuts to research funding are adding additional stress to colleges’ already precarious cost structure.\n\n\nMore damaging than the cost curve is the shift in how students view the value of higher education. Having grown up with Amazon, Netflix, and Google, students expect a speedy, on-demand, and low-friction experience. Moreover, they increasingly view college through a transactional lens: They pursue a degree to get a job. So they regard college much like any other consumer product, and like those other products, they expect it to be delivered how they want, when they want.

The university’s president, James E. Ryan, said the move signaled that “becoming a more diverse, equitable place is both the right and the smart thing to do.”\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the board voted unanimously to rescind any such numerical goals as part of a sweeping effort to wipe out evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The Trump administration had warned university officials, only the day before, that it had received complaints that the university wasn’t acting fast enough to carry through on its promise to “dismantle DEI apparatuses.”\n\n\nIn its letter on Monday, the Justice Department said the president had failed to produce a sufficiently detailed progress report. (A campus spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about whether the required report had been submitted.) It demanded that Ryan and Hardie certify by Friday that the vestiges of DEI have been removed from every division, department, program, and school.\n\n\nThe Board of Visitors deliberated during a closed session on Tuesday. The public portion of the meeting was not live-streamed. It’s unclear whether the board brought up the fact that Ryan, who became president in 2018, was one of more than 550 higher-education leaders who signed a statement circulated by the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) that condemned “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe.\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate was concerned enough about the board’s reaction that on Monday, it passed a resolution supporting Ryan and his decision to sign the AAC&U statement, saying it “expresses principles that are essential to upholding UVA’s mission, reputation, and operations.”\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate had encouraged Ryan to collaborate with other university presidents to promote higher education’s contributions to the nation. Ryan’s signature, it said, reaffirmed the university’s established policies on institutional statements and free expression. The former discourages the university from commenting on social or political issues “unless the matter directly affects the university’s mission or operations.”\n\n\nTrump’s 100-Day War on Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/30/how-trumps-first-100-days-transformed-higher-ed\n10 things done such as “Pursuing Punishment as Policy” and “Breeding Financial Uncertainty” and “Tanking America’s Global Stature”.

We look to you for leadership and coalition-building during a time when the stakes have never been higher.\n\n\nWe ask all sixty institutions under government threat to unite in a coordinated, proactive defense.\n\n(~3009 signatories)\n\nAdvocating for Brown – What’s at stake | Office of the President | Brown University\n\nhttps://president.brown.edu/president/advocating-brown-whats-stake\n\nIt’s important to share what is at stake for Brown. The research funding cuts that Brown has already suffered are causing immediate harm, forcing us to reconfigure our operations and budget to address funding shortfalls. Any long-term cuts of significant magnitude would imperil, or possibly end, several areas of high-impact research at Brown. This would be devastating to Brown’s research community, including the undergraduate, graduate and medical students we teach, and the people, patients and communities that benefit from the results of our research.\n\n\nEven more concerning, since early April, Brown has not been reimbursed for any expenses associated with active (i.e., not terminated) grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), whose grants make up roughly 70% of Brown’s overall research portfolio. Again, we have not been given any official explanation for why expenses for active grants are not being reimbursed. These unreimbursed expenses, which amount to millions of dollars per week, represent a significant threat to Brown’s financial sustainability and its ability to conduct federally funded research.\n\n\nAs we navigate the current environment, I continue to share a set of core principles:\n\n\nBrown will always defend the ability for students and scholars to teach and learn without fear of government intrusion or censorship, which is fundamental to efforts to protect academic freedom.\n\n\nBrown is deeply committed to following the law and maintaining an academic community where all can participate fully in the life of the institution. This means maintaining a campus that is free of all forms of harassment and discrimination for all community members, including addressing allegations of discrimination based on shared ancestry. We are proud of our initiatives to combat antisemitism, many of which we launched even before this became a major area of focus for the federal government.\n\n\nBrown will continue to provide resources and support to members of our international community."

And faculty members at the Big Ten universities are ramping up pressure on their institutions to collaborate and defend one another against threats from the administration.\n\n\nMore and More Faculty Groups Want Their Colleges to Stand Together Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/more-and-more-faculty-groups-want-their-colleges-to-stand-together-against-trump\n\nFaculty senates across the nation are endorsing the idea of standing collectively against the actions of the Trump administration. Ten of the Big Ten’s 18 member institutions have adopted resolutions in recent weeks calling for an alliance among that group’s members, and on Saturday the State University of New York’s University Faculty Senate also endorsed a mutual-defense compact.\n\n\nWithin the City University of New York system, the Senates at Hunter College, Hostos Community College, and the City College of New York have done the same for a New York-based effort.\n\n\nSupport for mutual-defense compacts has come alongside several other efforts to stand against the Trump administration’s actions, among them the AAC&U statement condemning “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe, which now has been signed by more than 500 higher-ed leaders.\n\n\nPresidents and trustees from about 10 institutions have also formed an informal private collective to discuss possible responses to the administration, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The Journal did not name those institutions but noted that they included Ivy League campuses and top private research universities, primarily in blue states.\n\n\nA call for unity among researchers, libraries, publishers, journalists and the public in fighting the Trump administration.\n\nhttps://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2025/04/30/trump-v-research-how-we-could-turn-the-threats-into-opportunities/\n(Thanks BE!)\n\n“while it’s encouraging to see some organizations coming together within their existing siloes, that’s not enough. There’s a real opportunity – and imperative – for all stakeholders in the research community to join forces. Each group plays a vital role in the research endeavor. Now is the time to show our support for everyone’s contributions, and to help everyone understand that, by dismantling the research infrastructure through censorship and defunding, we hamper research progress and its benefits in the US and across the world. We call on the industry bodies that represent all these different stakeholders to leverage their relationships and networks to develop something that’s bigger than just a campaign — a movement that spans all individuals and organizations working to fund, conduct, support, and disseminate the science and scholarship essential for our survival and success.\n\n\n“So let’s set aside our usual disagreements (open access business models, pricing, copyright, etc., etc.) to focus on what’s really important right now.

When Mr. Trump began threatening the university with canceled funds this spring, many Harvard professors and students urged administrators to head straight to the ramparts and denounce him. Alan Garber, Harvard’s president, took a wiser approach. He acknowledged that some of Mr. Trump’s criticisms had merit. Harvard, like much of elite higher education, has, in fact, been blasé about antisemitism, and it has too often prioritized progressive ideology over an independent search for truth.\n\n\nBy admitting as much, Mr. Garber strengthened Harvard’s political position. He said what many Americans believed. But when the administration issued a list of ludicrous demands, Harvard fought back hard. It filed a lawsuit, with help from a legal team that included conservative litigators, and became a national symbol of resistance to his lawlessness. Mr. Garber made Harvard look reasonable and Mr. Trump unreasonable."

You need to trace its roots in the 1960s, its evolution through the culture wars of the 1980s and ’90s, and into the current populist fray. Then you need to do something about it. Professors, administrators, students, and concerned citizens can no longer stand on the sidelines, shaking our heads and deploring the potentially devastating consequences. The simple truth is this: For decades, outside forces have — both consciously and unintentionally — undermined the integrity and quality of public higher education in America. And time and time again, a divided academic community has failed to combat them effectively. We can and must do better. Seeds of resistance are sprouting. Together, we must nurture their growth.

With labs, dormitories, lecture halls, athletic facilities, and so much else, colleges have exorbitant fixed costs. Those fixed costs have typically been covered in large part by student enrollment. Now that enrollment is declining, higher education’s cost curve is breaking. No amount of cutting will fix the underlying problem. Many colleges have masked their operating deficiencies by using Covid-relief funds in the past few years, but now, with those funds exhausted, they are dealing with a broken economic model. The Trump administration’s cuts to research funding are adding additional stress to colleges’ already precarious cost structure.\n\n\nMore damaging than the cost curve is the shift in how students view the value of higher education. Having grown up with Amazon, Netflix, and Google, students expect a speedy, on-demand, and low-friction experience. Moreover, they increasingly view college through a transactional lens: They pursue a degree to get a job. So they regard college much like any other consumer product, and like those other products, they expect it to be delivered how they want, when they want. Why wouldn’t they?\n\nI’d quote the next line, but it ends with “AI is going to decimate faculty ranks”… But I will quote this one:\n\nThe big mistake faculty members make is underestimating the existential threat AI represents to their livelihoods.\n\n\nIs Your Online Student a Bot?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/is-your-online-student-a-bot\n(Following an article K had shared earlier)"

The report said that bias incidents had been occurring before the Hamas attack and were intensified by the war in Gaza. It found that antisemitism seemed to be more pronounced in branches of the university with a social justice bent, including the graduate school of education, the divinity school and the school of public health.\n\n\nA similar task force held hundreds of conversations with Muslim, Arab and Palestinian students, staff and faculty members about anti-Muslim bias. That task force summed up the feelings expressed by many of those people in two words: “abandoned and silenced.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Doesn’t Want to Protect All Jewish Students — Just Those on His Team\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/opinion/jewish-student-protesters-gaza.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(For distinctions in position between different Jewish organizations like ADL and Jewish Voice for Peace)\n\nNYTimes: Harvard, Under Pressure, Revamps D.E.I.

Over the next month and a half, it would turn to the same playbook to wrest billions of dollars from universities it accused of antisemitism and other forms of discrimination, ignoring legal and procedural safeguards that had been set up to ensure due process.\n\n\nPresident Trump’s willingness to break norms and bend the rule of law has sparked confusion and alarm on college campuses.\n\n\nEducation Dept.

The university’s president, James E. Ryan, said the move signaled that “becoming a more diverse, equitable place is both the right and the smart thing to do.”\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the board voted unanimously to rescind any such numerical goals as part of a sweeping effort to wipe out evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The Trump administration had warned university officials, only the day before, that it had received complaints that the university wasn’t acting fast enough to carry through on its promise to “dismantle DEI apparatuses.”\n\n\nIn its letter on Monday, the Justice Department said the president had failed to produce a sufficiently detailed progress report. (A campus spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about whether the required report had been submitted.) It demanded that Ryan and Hardie certify by Friday that the vestiges of DEI have been removed from every division, department, program, and school.\n\n\nThe Board of Visitors deliberated during a closed session on Tuesday. The public portion of the meeting was not live-streamed. It’s unclear whether the board brought up the fact that Ryan, who became president in 2018, was one of more than 550 higher-education leaders who signed a statement circulated by the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) that condemned “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe.\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate was concerned enough about the board’s reaction that on Monday, it passed a resolution supporting Ryan and his decision to sign the AAC&U statement, saying it “expresses principles that are essential to upholding UVA’s mission, reputation, and operations.”\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate had encouraged Ryan to collaborate with other university presidents to promote higher education’s contributions to the nation. Ryan’s signature, it said, reaffirmed the university’s established policies on institutional statements and free expression. The former discourages the university from commenting on social or political issues “unless the matter directly affects the university’s mission or operations.”\n\n\nTrump’s 100-Day War on Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/30/how-trumps-first-100-days-transformed-higher-ed\n10 things done such as “Pursuing Punishment as Policy” and “Breeding Financial Uncertainty” and “Tanking America’s Global Stature”.

Newton wrote in an email. “It would result in diminished financial aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs, and lost opportunities for innovation. The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America,” he wrote.\n\nAlso reported here\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/us/white-house-harvard-tax-status\n\nNYTimes: Harvard’s Trick for Fighting Trump?

Many of the eliminated grants had descriptions that included terms like “minorities,” “transgender,” “AIDS” and “vaccine hesitancy.” But cuts have also affected research on the chronic diseases that Mr. Kennedy has made his priority; for instance, funding has been cut for a grant to Columbia University for a study that has followed people who have diabetes or are at risk of developing it for more than a quarter-century\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Faculty Protests as Trump Officials Hail University Concessions\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/columbia-trump-response.html\n\nEarlier on Monday, at least 50 professors turned out in a steady drizzle outside the campus gates to protest the funding cuts and what they criticized as Columbia’s conciliatory response.

The National Institutes of Health normally provides billions of dollars to universities every year for medical and public-health research. Proposed cuts to that funding are now being challenged in courts. In the meantime, some schools have rescinded admission offers to graduate students.\n\n\nWhile many faculty members argue universities shouldn’t yield to Trump, they are in a tricky spot. It isn’t uncommon for a quarter or more of the operating budget of a large university to come from federal sources in the forms of student loans, Pell Grants and research funding—research that supporters say goes on to produce innovations and fuel the broader economy.\n\n\nTrump’s actions constitute a “war on civil society,” Roth [Wesleyan PResident] has told Connecticut lawmakers.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s insecurity state\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4izVKU2\n\n[Trump post] While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House House Governor’s Conference,” he posted, “we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases.

Apparently failing to understand that extortion is rarely a one-time deal, the university agreed to the concessions. (Sure enough, a senior Justice Department official indicated in a recent radio interview that more concessions would be needed.)\n\n\nSo much of what orbits the president is held in place by the gravitational pull of his insecurity.\n\n\nColumbia Capitulated — But So Did the Rest of Higher Ed (Thanks Kimora)\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/columbia-capitulated-but-so-did-the-rest-of-higher-ed\n\n“Unless higher education discovers its collective nerve and collective voice, those who “threaten the very mission of the university and its values of free inquiry” will get precisely what they want. And if it allows such a thing to happen without putting up more of a fight in defense of its mission and social purpose, higher education — it deeply pains me to acknowledge — will get what it deserves.”\n\n\nThis is why all our statements on academic freedom are important.

But it may not pass. Even if it does, the universities that survive may be weakened, frightened shadows of their former selves.\n\n\nNYTimes: ‘This Is Worse’: Trump’s Judicial Defiance Veers Beyond the Autocrat Playbook\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/europe/trump-courts-defiance-autocrats-playbook.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(While not about higher education, this article compares the Trump Adminstrations to other autocratic regime’s approach to capturing the judicial system.)\n\n“We look at these comparative cases in the 21st century, like Hungary and Poland and Turkey. And in a lot of respects, this is worse,” he said. “These first two months have been much more aggressively authoritarian than almost any other comparable case I know of democratic backsliding.”\n\n\nTrump can’t fix American universities by breaking them\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4bOsq9T\n\nFlorida pioneered the kind of crackdown the Trump administration is attempting, and now more left-leaning students and professors in that state have begun describing exactly the kind of speech-chilling atmosphere that conservatives have been complaining about for years. Professors there have steered students away from discussing topics that seem forbidden, including “intersectionality,” and are afraid that students are recording them, the Wall Street Journal has reported. Students voiced similar fears that classmates would broadcast their remarks on social media, and one student publication trimmed its coverage to protect its funding\n\n\nNYTimes: $15 Billion Is Enough to Fight a President\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/trump-university-endowment-spending.html\n\nThus far, university presidents have largely kept their heads down rather than uniting to oppose Mr. Trump’s assault. That is a mistake. A key authoritarian strategy is to single out prominent individuals or institutions for repression so that others, afraid, forgo legitimate criticism of the authoritarian leader. Often, universities are some of the first institutions that authoritarians attack. Make no mistake, the Trump administration’s punitive cuts to federal research grants and detention of university students or faculty, couched under the President’s grievances over diversity programs and campus protests, are early signs of this strategy at work in America.\n\n\nLegal scholars on what Columbia University should have done — and what other colleges could do next.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/it-is-remarkable-how-quickly-the-chill-has-descended\n\nwith the exceptions of the presidents of Brown and Princeton, the leadership of academia has been pretty much absent; everyone is taking a duck-and-cover attitude. So Armstrong [Columbia’s President] felt she was on her own. That’s my most sympathetic read, even though I wish she had taken a firmer stand.\n\n\nSo there’s this very rational cost-benefit analysis where administrators are thinking, “Well, if we speak up and others do not …” It’s a collective-action problem in which, in the moment, it’s always easier not to speak. This is why we have free-speech protections — speech is easily chilled. It is remarkable how quickly the chill has descended.\n\n\nA less sympathetic reading: My sense of what was motivating both the Paul Weiss and Columbia leadership is a view that the concessions being demanded were not very significant.\n\n\nThat in itself is a significant indication of where we are. I’ve been reading all the free-speech policies at different schools. There’s lovely language in the policies about how universities are sites of dissent and how protest is meant to be valued. About how we want to give our students the freedom to question what is in the classroom and what’s outside the classroom. Chicago has a wonderful statement written by David Strauss, who was the head of the ad-hoc committee on protest and dissent, in which he says protest is not only integral to the life of the university because we are a community of dissent, but administrators should strive to problem-solve. So when students break the rules, don’t use discipline. Try to figure out what the cause of their concern is. Since October 7, there has been a demise of that kind of talking and that kind of imagining.\n\n\nIt feels like we are saying goodbye to this beautiful democratic vision of the university and we are now thinking of the university as a place where order must be maintained.\n\n\nThis Time, Higher Ed’s Resistance to Trump is Being Led by Its Associations\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/this-time-higher-eds-resistance-to-trump-is-being-led-by-its-associations\n(The board of ACE is chaired by CUNY’s Chancellor.)\n\nin opening remarks at ACE’s annual conference, Mitchell [ACE’s President] condemned Trump’s actions in unusually strong words. “The flurry of these threats,” he said, “were designed to cow us into silence. When we face threats, we will not cower.”\n\n\nTo Todd Wolfson, president of the AAUP, doing so [joining a lawsuite] was a necessity. “It’s our job to protect our members and to protect their places of employment and their sector,” he said. “If somebody wants to argue with me that’s not the role of unions and associations, I’d love to hear it. But I think this is a fundamental duty of ours, if not the fundamental duty.”\n\n\nNYTimes: David Leonhardt on How Universities Can Stop Trump’s ‘Destroying Agenda’\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/opinion/universities-trump-fight-back.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLeonhardt: It’s important to say that a lot of the conservative critics of universities, including Christopher Rufo, also don’t want a fully open debate. They want to restrict debate in many cases so that it’s just their view of the world. They want to take books out of schools about L.G.B.T. people. That’s really damaging.\n\n\nA world in which Donald Trump’s ideological enforcers are going through a course catalog or telling schools exactly what their admissions policies need to be, rather than letting schools follow the Supreme Court ruling on it, would be a really damaging world.\n\n\nI think we’re on track at a lot of universities and also law firms and other institutions that you’ve written about where people are going to say: Well, can I make a deal with Trump or can I keep my head down and stay out of the line of fire? Maybe not appreciating that this guy and the people around him like Chris Rufo are on a war footing.\n\n\nDear Colleagues: The Time for Boldness Is Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/03/27/letter-faculty-self-censorship-and-boldness-opinion\n\nI do not deny that we are living in perilous times, but what good are academic freedom and tenure if we do not use them? Some think, I believe mistakenly, that speaking out will only embolden the attacks on higher education institutions and faculty. I, instead, am more compelled by Frederick Douglass’s proclamation, “Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted …”\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: U.S. Lodges New Accusations Against Detained Columbia Protest Leader\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-trump-allegations.html\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be using the new allegations in part to sidestep the First Amendment issues raised by Mr. Khalil’s case. On Sunday, in a filing opposing his release, Justice Department lawyers argued that the new allegations reduced the importance of concerns about Mr. Khalil’s right to free speech.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow an Accreditation War Could Start\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-an-accreditation-war-could-start\n\nNow President Trump threatens to wield accreditation as a weapon, something which, if carried out, would muzzle the creativity and innovation that has fueled America’s lead.\n\n\nWhat stands in Trump’s way? The federal law establishing the Department of Education prohibits federal interference in curricular matters. That federal law would change, however, if the department is eliminated.\n\n\nAnother obstacle is the First Amendment: If the administration were to directly attack accreditors’ opinions or academic perspectives, they would expose themselves to legal challenges. The administration could respond to this by claiming a national-security concern (say, holding that diversity, equity, and inclusion are part of a Marxist threat to America).\n\n\nIf you have stories you would like me to include in anticipated future digests, please send along via an email to me directly (john.verzani@csi.cuny.edu).",

Trump was inaugurated, a senior scientist at the National Institutes of Health was preparing to give an invited talk at a scientific meeting when an urgent call came in from an administrative assistant.\n\n\nThere is a total communications ban, the scientist was told, and you cannot give the speech.\n\n\nAs soon as the scientist got back to the office, another ban went into effect — one that prohibited researchers from submitting papers to journals for publication.\n\n\nOne said that DOGE had begun a reign of “chaos and confusion.”\n\n\nHundreds of highly competitive grants that support research at universities and medical schools across the country have been cut. Many of the eliminated grants had descriptions that included terms like “minorities,” “transgender,” “AIDS” and “vaccine hesitancy.” But cuts have also affected research on the chronic diseases that Mr. Kennedy has made his priority; for instance, funding has been cut for a grant to Columbia University for a study that has followed people who have diabetes or are at risk of developing it for more than a quarter-century\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Faculty Protests as Trump Officials Hail University Concessions\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/columbia-trump-response.html\n\nEarlier on Monday, at least 50 professors turned out in a steady drizzle outside the campus gates to protest the funding cuts and what they criticized as Columbia’s conciliatory response. The professors said they hoped to be the vanguard of a resistance movement among academics that remains, for now, at an early stage.\n\n\n“We need to stand up, all of us,” said Michael Thaddeus, a mathematics professor at Columbia and vice president of the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors, speaking to the crowd. “We need to organize, from the grass roots to the national level. If we lead, our leaders will follow.”\n\nNYTimes: ‘It Is Hard to Imagine a More Sweeping Agenda to Make Americans Less Healthy’\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/trump-toxins-cancer-environment.html\nScroll down to find\n\nTurning to the issue of medical research, Duke University provides a case study of the problems facing higher education institutions that are struggling to maintain research budgets under the Trump administration.\n\n\nDonald McDonnell, a professor of molecular cancer biology at Duke whose laboratory has received $40 million from N.I.H. over 30 years, told the A.P. that his lab is likely to go into the red because of the uncertainty of N.I.H. grants, forcing him to order layoffs: “The bottom line is, I can’t live, I can’t think in this chaos,” McDonnell said.\n\n\nThe threatened cuts, according to McDonnell, have endangered the next generation of researchers.

The EPA terminated the grant on Feb. 21, saying the “award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities,” according to an email reviewed by The Post.",

The National Institutes of Health normally provides billions of dollars to universities every year for medical and public-health research. Proposed cuts to that funding are now being challenged in courts. In the meantime, some schools have rescinded admission offers to graduate students.\n\n\nWhile many faculty members argue universities shouldn’t yield to Trump, they are in a tricky spot. It isn’t uncommon for a quarter or more of the operating budget of a large university to come from federal sources in the forms of student loans, Pell Grants and research funding—research that supporters say goes on to produce innovations and fuel the broader economy.\n\n\nTrump’s actions constitute a “war on civil society,” Roth [Wesleyan PResident] has told Connecticut lawmakers.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s insecurity state\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4izVKU2\n\n[Trump post] While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House House Governor’s Conference,” he posted, “we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases.

And if it allows such a thing to happen without putting up more of a fight in defense of its mission and social purpose, higher education — it deeply pains me to acknowledge — will get what it deserves.”\n\n\nThis is why all our statements on academic freedom are important.

Since October 7, there has been a demise of that kind of talking and that kind of imagining.\n\n\nIt feels like we are saying goodbye to this beautiful democratic vision of the university and we are now thinking of the university as a place where order must be maintained.\n\n\nThis Time, Higher Ed’s Resistance to Trump is Being Led by Its Associations\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/this-time-higher-eds-resistance-to-trump-is-being-led-by-its-associations\n(The board of ACE is chaired by CUNY’s Chancellor.)\n\nin opening remarks at ACE’s annual conference, Mitchell [ACE’s President] condemned Trump’s actions in unusually strong words. “The flurry of these threats,” he said, “were designed to cow us into silence. When we face threats, we will not cower.”\n\n\nTo Todd Wolfson, president of the AAUP, doing so [joining a lawsuite] was a necessity. “It’s our job to protect our members and to protect their places of employment and their sector,” he said. “If somebody wants to argue with me that’s not the role of unions and associations, I’d love to hear it. But I think this is a fundamental duty of ours, if not the fundamental duty.”\n\n\nNYTimes: David Leonhardt on How Universities Can Stop Trump’s ‘Destroying Agenda’\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/opinion/universities-trump-fight-back.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLeonhardt: It’s important to say that a lot of the conservative critics of universities, including Christopher Rufo, also don’t want a fully open debate. They want to restrict debate in many cases so that it’s just their view of the world. They want to take books out of schools about L.G.B.T. people. That’s really damaging.\n\n\nA world in which Donald Trump’s ideological enforcers are going through a course catalog or telling schools exactly what their admissions policies need to be, rather than letting schools follow the Supreme Court ruling on it, would be a really damaging world.\n\n\nI think we’re on track at a lot of universities and also law firms and other institutions that you’ve written about where people are going to say: Well, can I make a deal with Trump or can I keep my head down and stay out of the line of fire? Maybe not appreciating that this guy and the people around him like Chris Rufo are on a war footing.\n\n\nDear Colleagues: The Time for Boldness Is Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/03/27/letter-faculty-self-censorship-and-boldness-opinion\n\nI do not deny that we are living in perilous times, but what good are academic freedom and tenure if we do not use them? Some think, I believe mistakenly, that speaking out will only embolden the attacks on higher education institutions and faculty. I, instead, am more compelled by Frederick Douglass’s proclamation, “Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted …”",

The federal law establishing the Department of Education prohibits federal interference in curricular matters. That federal law would change, however, if the department is eliminated.\n\n\nAnother obstacle is the First Amendment: If the administration were to directly attack accreditors’ opinions or academic perspectives, they would expose themselves to legal challenges.

It is using executive orders and financial threats to manipulate which studies are funded or published, how results are reported, and which data and research findings the public can access. The administration is blocking research on topics it finds objectionable, such as climate change, or that yields results it does not like, on topics ranging from vaccine safety to economic trends.\n\n\nWe call on the administration to cease its wholesale assault on U.S. science, and we urge the public to join this call.\n\n\nHarvard faculty letter\n\n(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DkzY8JnLyC8-vhPk2-RXfrLKvYbDjJ2ugAQBmCDQIk0/edit?tab=t.0)\n\nConstitutional law scholars letter on Columbia\n\nhttps://www.nybooks.com/online/2025/03/20/a-statement-from-constitutional-law-scholars-on-columbia/\n\nUCLA Law Faculty letter\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/letter-ucla-law-students\n\n“Not in our name” open letter\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/e/2PACX-1vRt_jMNTlIH7ABX_s7fQFuspYWf_yN2OGzfbrVzhNoO87YWlCyPQzhaq2VcWYDGYvWJRfLq7lNtpnd4/pub?pli=1&urp=gmail_link\n(Thanks VAC)\n\n\n\n\nResolution to Establish a Mutual Defense Compact for the Universities of the Big Ten Academic Alliance in Defense of Academic Freedom, Institutional Integrity, and the Research Enterprise\n\nhttps://senate.rutgers.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Resolution-to-Establish-a-Mutual-Defense-Compact-for-the-Universities-of-the-Big-Ten-Academic-Alliance-in-Defense-of-Academic-Freedom-Institutional-Integrity-and-the-Research.pdf\nThis is the NATO style of defense, when the come for one, they come for all.

The gen-ed curriculum itself, which faculty will control, must be revised to help students “understand opposing points of view” and ponder “enduring questions of meaning, purpose, and value.” The center is a pilot program that lawmakers want to expand to other Utah colleges in the coming years.\n\n\nNo Noncitizen Professor at My Institution Can Speak About Politics Ever Again\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/no-noncitizen-professor-at-my-institution-can-speak-about-politics-ever-again\n\nTwo months into Trump’s second term, [Jason] Stanley has decided to leave Yale for the University of Toronto. He will follow two prominent colleagues, Timothy Snyder and Marci Shore, both history professors, to Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy.\n\n\nThere’s a complete failure to see that the far right is not trying to have a debate. They’re not trying to have an argument. The ‘institutional neutrality’ stuff, it’s a strategy. There’s no reasonable conversation that’s being had.\n\n\nThey have a set of strategies to take down our institutions. The main part is to get all these concerned liberals on board, to trick them, because they don’t realize they’re going to come for the institutions no matter what. You want to show to the right wing that you’re a reasonable liberal, you can debate them. But they don’t care.\n\n\nI saw mistake after mistake.

The administration has paused $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania amid an investigation into its athletics policies. And it temporarily paused more than $100 million in funding to the University of Maine system after the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, said she would not observe the president’s executive order on transgender athletes, which does not carry the force of law.\n\n\nNYTimes: Professors Pushed Harvard to Resist Trump. Now Billions Are on the Line.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/republicans-harvard-funding.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(NY Times blaming the victims in the headline…again)\n\n“The sharks circle when they smell blood in the water,” said Kenneth Roth, a former director of Human Rights Watch and a fellow at Harvard, who wants Harvard to fight better to allow robust debate and academic freedom.\n\n\n“That every-man-for-themselves response is about to cost us our democracy,” said Dr. Levitsky, who studies authoritarian regimes.\n\n\nAs President Trump’s inauguration approached, Harvard hired Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep ties to Mr. Trump. On the first full day of the Trump presidency, the university announced it was adopting a highly debated definition of antisemitism — which labels certain criticisms of Israel, such as calling its existence racist, as antisemitic — a move encouraged by the new administration but slammed by free speech advocates.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Pauses Dozens of Federal Grants to Princeton\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/trump-federal-grants-princeton.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration moved this week to suspend dozens of federal grants to Princeton University, the fourth Ivy League school that has seen its financial support from Washington reduced or explicitly threatened since March.\n\n\nAccording to Princeton’s most recent financial report, the university received more than $455 million through government grants and contracts during the fiscal year that ended in June 2024. That money accounted for roughly 18 percent of the university’s revenues.\n\n\nWho Is on Trump’s Antisemitism Task Force?\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/02/who-trumps-antisemitism-task-force?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed&utm_campaign=d776e1ff03-DNU_2021_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1fcbc04421-d776e1ff03-197464749&mc_cid=d776e1ff03&mc_eid=50634a26f0\n\nStaff and Funding Cuts at the NEH Loom\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/03/staff-and-funding-cuts-neh-loom\n\nHumanities advocates don’t know exactly how large the cuts to NEH’s approximately 180-person staff or $78.25 million grant budget will be, but they note that “patterns at other agencies” provide a solid hint. The impact on colleges and universities, they say, would be crushing.\n\n\nResearchers, Higher Ed Union Fight NIH Grant Terminations\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/04/02/researchers-higher-ed-union-fight-nih-grant\n\nIndividual university researchers, a public health advocacy organization and a union representing more than 120,000 higher education workers are suing the National Institutes of Health after the agency terminated more than $2.4 billion in grants it claims support “non-scientific” projects that “no longer” effectuate agency priorities.\n\n\nNYTimes: The Next Generation of American Scientists Is Losing Faith\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/opinion/young-american-scientists.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMost American scientists understood a second Trump term was unlikely to be friendly to their kind, but few anticipated such a rapid bulldozing. The N.I.H. — the largest public funder of biomedical and behavioral research in the world — announced it would slash funding to universities for overhead, or indirect, costs, which often covers laboratories’ operational needs. …The agency has lost nearly one-fourth of its 18,000 employees because of job cuts, buyouts and some employees’ choosing early retirement, according to reporting by NPR.\n\n\nNYTimes: I Led Harvard’s Medical School, and I Fear for What’s to Come\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/opinion/harvard-medicine-higher-education.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Sends Harvard a List of Demands to Protect Federal Funds\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/trump-harvard-funding-demands.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn both instances, the government asked Harvard and Columbia to impose bans, with few exemptions, on masking.\n\n\nThe Trump administration also pressured the universities to intensify efforts to hold student groups “accountable,” cease admissions practices based on race, color or national origin and revamp policies on campus protests.\n\n\nit said that Harvard’s “programs and departments that fuel antisemitic harassment must be reviewed and necessary changes made to address bias, improve viewpoint diversity, and end ideological capture.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Set to Pause $510 Million for Brown University\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/trump-administration-brown-university-funding-pause.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThis adds Brown to the list that includes now: Columbia, Princeton, Harvard, UPenn\n\n\n\n\nA militant Zionist group threatens activists online with a ‘deport list’\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/03/29/zionist-palestinians-deportations-x/\n\nAlmost six weeks before federal immigration officials detained Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, a group called Betar US said on its X account that it had put the pro-Palestinian activist on “our deport list.”\n\n\nICE Revoking Students’ Immigration Statuses Without Their or the University’s Knowledge\n\nhttps://zeteo.com/p/ice-manually-revoking-university-students-residency-status-middle-east\n\nThree university officials, who were given anonymity so they could speak freely, across the country report that, in recent days, student residency statuses in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System – SEVIS, a database where residency statuses of foreign students are managed – are being changed without their knowledge.\n\n[This source is not well known, here is a similar article from inside higher ed]\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/04/03/how-trump-wreaking-havoc-student-visa-system\n\nICE tracker\n\nhttps://public.tableau.com/app/profile/danielleharlow/viz/UnitedStatesDisappearedTracker/Map\n(Shared from the FGL list)\n\nNYTimes: Unmarked Vans.

The self-appointed enforcers are vigilant. This, too, is a hallmark of a secret-police state.\n\n\nNYTimes: Cornell Student Facing Deportation Felt Drawn to Protest\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/cornell-student-deportation-protest.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: How Colleges Are Cracking Down on Students Now\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/29/us/universities-students-search-warrants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAfter reviewing security footage, the university police obtained warrants to search a student’s car and cellphone. The investigator found photos of the statue covered in paint, and the student was charged with two counts of criminal mischief.\n\n(On April 14th, the board will vote on the use of body-worn cameras by select peace officers with policies related to data retention and data sharing inherited from other policies, and perhaps in need of review.)\n\nNYTimes: Leaders of Harvard’s Middle Eastern Studies Center Will Leave\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/leaders-of-harvards-middle-eastern-studies-center-will-leave.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe university has also been under pressure from Republicans to be more welcoming to conservative viewpoints.\n\n\nMontreal doctor says NYU cancelled her presentation\n\nhttps://www.ctvnews.ca/montreal/article/climate-of-fear-montreal-doctor-says-nyu-cancelled-her-presentation/\n\nA couple of the slides in her presentation touched on the casualties in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas war as well as the cuts at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Liu said she was told the slides about Gaza “could be perceived as antisemitic” while the USAID section might be perceived as “anti governmental.”\n\n\nLiu, who was already in New York when she got the call, offered to make edits to those slides but then three hours later, after some deliberations, she said the university apologized and said they had to cancel.\n\n\nA McGill University professor told CTV News last week that he cancelled three visits to the U.S. due to the current political climate and what he believes is the “breakdown of the rule of law” south of the border. He said other colleagues are also avoiding visits to the U.S.\n\nAlso reported on at the NY Times:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/nyregion/nyu-doctor-speech-canceled.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: I’m Cornell’s President.

Fortunately for our students, Cornell is not a business. We are a university. And universities, despite rapidly escalating political, legal and financial risks, cannot afford to cede the space of public discourse and the free exchange of ideas.\n\n\nNYTimes: If Powerful Places Like Harvard Don’t Stand Up to Trump, Who Can?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/opinion/larry-summers-harvard-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut the Trump administration is not acting in good faith in its purported antisemitism concerns, nor is it following the law in its approach to universities.\n\n\nUniversities facing those threats should make clear they are willing to negotiate with government officials only over matters covered by statute and through the procedures laid out in the law.\n\n\n[Though, not really a faculty senate champion] That will not happen through universities’ usual deliberative processes, which give too much power to faculty members who have political agendas. It will require strong, determined leaders backed by confident and competent trustees.\n\n\n\n\n\nColumbia University’s President Resigns - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/columbia-universitys-president-resigns.html\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Campus Occupation Could Have Ended Without Police, Report Says\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/nyregion/columbia-protests-police.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe new details of the final hours of the occupation of Hamilton Hall on April 30 were among the key revelations of the 335-page report, which was written by a group within the senate, a Columbia policymaking body that includes faculty members, students and administrators, with faculty in the majority. The senate is independent from the administration and has been critical of its protest response.\n\n\n\n\n\n‘It reminds you of a fascist state’: Smithsonian Institution braces for Trump rewrite of US history\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/30/smithsonian-institution-trump-executive-order\n\n“It is a five-alarm fire for public history, science and education in America,” said Samuel Redman, a history professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “While the Smithsonian has faced crisis moments in the past, it has not been directly attacked in quite this way by the executive branch in its long history. It’s troubling and quite scary.”\n\n\nAs in so many other ways, however, Trump’s second term is a whole different beast. The president believes there has been a “concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our nation’s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth”, according to the White House executive order.\n\n\n400 Books Removed From Naval Academy Library\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/03/400-books-removed-naval-academy-library\n\nThat list included The Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr., Einstein on Race and Racism, and a biography of Jackie Robinson.

The gen-ed curriculum itself, which faculty will control, must be revised to help students “understand opposing points of view” and ponder “enduring questions of meaning, purpose, and value.” The center is a pilot program that lawmakers want to expand to other Utah colleges in the coming years.\n\n\nNo Noncitizen Professor at My Institution Can Speak About Politics Ever Again\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/no-noncitizen-professor-at-my-institution-can-speak-about-politics-ever-again\n\nTwo months into Trump’s second term, [Jason] Stanley has decided to leave Yale for the University of Toronto.

The administration has paused $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania amid an investigation into its athletics policies. And it temporarily paused more than $100 million in funding to the University of Maine system after the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, said she would not observe the president’s executive order on transgender athletes, which does not carry the force of law.\n\n\nNYTimes: Professors Pushed Harvard to Resist Trump. Now Billions Are on the Line.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/republicans-harvard-funding.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(NY Times blaming the victims in the headline…again)\n\n“The sharks circle when they smell blood in the water,” said Kenneth Roth, a former director of Human Rights Watch and a fellow at Harvard, who wants Harvard to fight better to allow robust debate and academic freedom.\n\n\n“That every-man-for-themselves response is about to cost us our democracy,” said Dr. Levitsky, who studies authoritarian regimes.\n\n\nAs President Trump’s inauguration approached, Harvard hired Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep ties to Mr. Trump. On the first full day of the Trump presidency, the university announced it was adopting a highly debated definition of antisemitism — which labels certain criticisms of Israel, such as calling its existence racist, as antisemitic — a move encouraged by the new administration but slammed by free speech advocates.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Pauses Dozens of Federal Grants to Princeton\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/trump-federal-grants-princeton.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration moved this week to suspend dozens of federal grants to Princeton University, the fourth Ivy League school that has seen its financial support from Washington reduced or explicitly threatened since March.\n\n\nAccording to Princeton’s most recent financial report, the university received more than $455 million through government grants and contracts during the fiscal year that ended in June 2024. That money accounted for roughly 18 percent of the university’s revenues.\n\n\nWho Is on Trump’s Antisemitism Task Force?\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/02/who-trumps-antisemitism-task-force?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed&utm_campaign=d776e1ff03-DNU_2021_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1fcbc04421-d776e1ff03-197464749&mc_cid=d776e1ff03&mc_eid=50634a26f0\n\nStaff and Funding Cuts at the NEH Loom\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/03/staff-and-funding-cuts-neh-loom\n\nHumanities advocates don’t know exactly how large the cuts to NEH’s approximately 180-person staff or $78.25 million grant budget will be, but they note that “patterns at other agencies” provide a solid hint.

The N.I.H. — the largest public funder of biomedical and behavioral research in the world — announced it would slash funding to universities for overhead, or indirect, costs, which often covers laboratories’ operational needs. …The agency has lost nearly one-fourth of its 18,000 employees because of job cuts, buyouts and some employees’ choosing early retirement, according to reporting by NPR.\n\n\nNYTimes: I Led Harvard’s Medical School, and I Fear for What’s to Come\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/opinion/harvard-medicine-higher-education.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Sends Harvard a List of Demands to Protect Federal Funds\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/trump-harvard-funding-demands.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn both instances, the government asked Harvard and Columbia to impose bans, with few exemptions, on masking.\n\n\nThe Trump administration also pressured the universities to intensify efforts to hold student groups “accountable,” cease admissions practices based on race, color or national origin and revamp policies on campus protests.\n\n\nit said that Harvard’s “programs and departments that fuel antisemitic harassment must be reviewed and necessary changes made to address bias, improve viewpoint diversity, and end ideological capture.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Set to Pause $510 Million for Brown University\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/trump-administration-brown-university-funding-pause.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThis adds Brown to the list that includes now: Columbia, Princeton, Harvard, UPenn",

And so in order to build a mafia state, such an aspiring patron needs to strip other agents of their money and power.\n\n\nAnd it has the ability to, if not bankrupt universities — it certainly has the ability to bankrupt universities that don’t have significant endowments, which is most of them.\n\n\nThe only way for universities to really address this is to come to terms with the fact that there is no way for them, with this administration, to keep their federal money.\n\n\nFor more on the steps the administration has signaled it might do to gain obesiance, this AAUP white paper from 2024 offers much insight (shared by VC):\n\nhttps://www.aaup.org/file/Manufacturing_Backlash_final_1.pdf\n\nwe have witnessed what one scholar correctly called an “unusually brazen series of challenges to academic freedom,” unleashed by conservative activists and a “national-level political machine” … to undermine academic freedom and university autonomy.\n\nIncluding academic gag orders seeking to ban the teaching of “critical race theory” (CRT); shuttering academic programs; dismantling institutional efforts to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion; weaken tenure protections for faculty; undermined the accreditation process; establish academic programs, centers, and whole schools designed to teach conservative content;\n\nAs this white paper demonstrates, however, this legislation is largely the outgrowth of efforts by right-wing and libertarian think tanks, working closely with Republican politicians, to manufacture a culture-war backlash against educators and academic institutions … as part of a well-organized and well-funded backlash that seeks to roll back the political, social, and cultural gains made in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement increased queer and trans visibility.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Insatiable\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/trump-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n&lt; In order to function effectively, Democracies depend on the ability of the electorate to make what Jackson calls “informed choices.” In this context, Jackson writes, “Knowledge institutions — including universities, the truth-oriented press, government offices with data collection or scientific responsibilities — are crucial for constitutional democracies.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s DOJ Claims Academic Journals Hold “Partisan” Stance in Scientific Debates – Mother Jones\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/04/trump-doj-academic-journals-scientific-debates-chest-journal/\n\nThe publisher of CHEST, a prestigious, peer-reviewed medical journal focused on respiratory health, received a letter from the Trump administration seeking information about how its editors handle scientific controversies and “competing viewpoints.” Some medical professionals see the missive as an attempt to stifle academic freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-DEI Guidance Letter Put On Hold, for Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/24/education-departments-anti-dei-guidance-blocked\n\nFederal judges in New Hampshire and Maryland handed down the rulings after finding plaintiffs in the two separate lawsuits were likely to succeed in proving that the Feb. 14 Dear Colleague letter violated procedural standards and the First Amendment. Prior to the orders, colleges and K-12 schools that failed to comply with the letter risked their federal funding\n\n\n“Although the 2025 letter does not make clear what exactly it prohibits, it makes at least one thing clear: schools should not come close to anything that could be considered ‘DEI,’ lest they be deemed to have guessed wrong,” the New Hampshire judge wrote. And since loss of federal grants could cripple institutions, “it is predictable—if not obvious—that [they] will eliminate all vestiges of DEI to avoid even the possibility of funding termination,” regardless of whether it is an example of executive overreach.\n\n\n\n\n\nMahmoud Khalil: What does my detention by ICE say about America?\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4czL2dT\n\nDetained Tufts student must be transferred to Vermont, judge rules\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/04/19/judge-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-vermont-ice/\n\nFearing Trump’s Visa Crackdown, College Students Race to Scrub Op-Eds - WSJ\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-student-visas-newspaper-op-eds-61595294\n\n\n\n\nWeekly NIH Funding Opportunities and Notices for April 18, 2025\n\n\n(none)\n\n(Thanks MP)\n\nUpdates on NSF Priorities | NSF - National Science Foundation\n\nhttps://www.nsf.gov/updates-on-priorities\n\nResearch projects with more narrow impact limited to subgroups of people based on protected class or characteristics do not effectuate NSF priorities.\n\n\n\nWhat types of awards are being terminated?

She received no official explanation for why the grant was being terminated more than a year ahead of its scheduled end. But Dr. Fiesler speculated that it had something to do with the word “misinformation” in the award’s abstract.\n\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the N.S.F. said that its grant cancellations were not in violation of the temporary restraining order. When asked by The Times to provide clarification on the legality of the grant cancellations, the agency declined to comment.\n\n\nLast Thursday, the magazine Nature reported that all new research grants by the agency had been frozen, as ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The N.S.F. declined to confirm the freezing of new awards or what role, if any, DOGE had in the action.\n\n\nNSF Director Resigns\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/25/nsf-director-panchanathan-resigns\n\nHis resignation comes less than one week after he issued sweeping priority changes—including terminating funding for projects that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion or combating misinformation—at the independent agency that funds billions of dollars to nonmedical university research each year.\n\n\n“I believe that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency and feel that it is time to pass the baton to new leadership,” Panchanathan wrote in a resignation letter, first reported by Science. “I am deeply grateful to the presidents for the opportunity to serve our nation.”\n\n\nUnder Panchanathan’s leadership, the NSF’s stated priorities have included increasing diversity in the STEM workforce, forming industry partnerships, job creation and broadening research opportunities for smaller universities and community colleges.\n\n\nTrump is destroying 100 years of competitive advantage in 100 days\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/25/us-losing-competitive-edge-science/\n\nAll three of these forces are now being reversed. The Trump administration is at war with the country’s leading universities, threatening them with hostile takeovers and withholding billions of dollars in research funding. America’s crown jewels of science, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, are being gutted.\n\n\nCUNY’s Research on Vaccine Misinformation Halted by Trump Administration | THE CITY — NYC News\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/04/24/cuny-layoffs-vaccine-research-funding-cuts-misinformation-trump/\n\nBut a day later, on March 11, the NIH terminated a $3.3 million project led by Nash [CUNY faculty member who provided sage advice and was widely cited during the pandemic] that studied whether or not brief digital messages could increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake among adults with mental health issues like anxiety and depression.\n\n\n“We’re looking at letting people go, furloughing them, people losing their health insurance and people losing their opportunity to do the kind of work that they signed up to do,” Nash said.\n\n\n“We’re doing our best to see them through, if they’re finishing their degree with us this year, getting them through to the end,” he added. “Our dean has also offered to try and help where he can. But CUNY is not a university with deep pockets. We don’t have an endowment that we can draw on for these kinds of things.”\n\nIn the Chancellor’s “Stand Together” email we have:\n\nWe are evaluating how changes to funding from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy and other federal agencies will impact our research and programming. Cuts in NIH reimbursements, for example, for operational costs of research and training are being challenged in court, but should they be carried out we estimate that CUNY would receive only about 35% of our expected $12.7 million payment on currently active grants. In addition, 61 CUNY research projects have been subject to stop-work orders from federal agencies.\n\n\nFlorida’s Own DOGE Reviews Faculty Research, Grants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/04/25/floridas-own-doge-reviewing-faculty-research-grants\n\nEarlier this month, the Florida DOGE asked public college and university presidents to provide an account—by the end of last week—of “all research published by staff” over the last six years, including “Papers and drafts made available to the public or in online academic repositories for drafts, preprints, or similar materials.”\n\n\n“If not contained therein, author’s name, title, and position at the institution” must be provided, according to the letters the presidents received. The letters didn’t say what this and other requests were for.\n\n\nThe Florida DOGE also requested information on all grants awarded to institutions over the last six years, asking for each institution’s policy on allocating grants “for purposes of indirect cost recovery, including procedures for calculation.” Further, it requested an account of “all filled and vacant positions held by any employee with a non-instructional role.”\n\n\nBy the end of April, Florida’s public institutions must also provide the “Length of research associated” with each research publication, funding sources associated with the research and any “publications about the research” from the researcher or institution. In addition, the state DOGE is requesting funding sources for each institution’s noninstructional positions and the names of the nonstudent employees administering the grants.\n\n\nAnd that may not be the end of the DOGE demands…\n\n\n\n\n\n“Trump to Sign Executive Order Targeting University Accreditors”\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-accreditors-executive-order-universities-4e4366cc?mod=djemalertNEWS\n(Thanks to DAM for this link).\n\n“Revoking accreditation is an existential threat for these universities,” said Andrew Gillen, a research fellow at the Cato Institute. “If you lose Pell grants and lose student loans, for most colleges that means you’re done.”\n\n\nSome conservatives have called for stronger changes to the watchdog function of higher education, including proposals to make schools accountable for the federal loans their students take out. Right now, schools aren’t penalized if graduates default on loans.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Signs Executive Order Targeting College Accreditors\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/trump-executive-order-university-accreditors.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Along with many others which will prove equally troubling if found legal)\n\n“The federal government has long stayed away from any involvement in a college’s curriculum or hiring, and current law prohibits this kind of intrusion into academic affairs,” Mr. Shireman [a senior fellow at the Century Foundation] said, adding that the executive order “steps far across this line.”\n\n\nMr. Trump also signed executive orders to encourage the use of artificial intelligence in schools, promote private-sector partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities, and increase the number of apprenticeships in skilled trade jobs. Another order instructed his administration to make it more difficult for universities to obscure details of foreign funding.\n\n\nTwo other orders focused on student discipline, which has been a political flashpoint for the past decade.\n\n\nOne order was to ensure that disciplinary policies were not based on D.E.I. policies. Another restricts the use of the so-called disparate impact rule, which civil rights groups have long said is an important tool for showing discrimination against minorities.\n\n\nTrump orders changes to civil rights rules, college accreditation\n\nhttps://wapo.st/42L5uEa\n\nThe EO\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/reforming-accreditation-to-strengthen-higher-education/\n\nAccreditors Sound Off on Executive Order\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/25/accreditors-sound-executive-order\n\nMiddle States issues and Advocacy Alert\n\nhttps://www.msche.org/2025/04/23/advocacy-alert-executive-order-regarding-accreditation/\n\n– The Order directs the Secretary of Education to hold higher education “accreditors” accountable, including through denial, monitoring, suspension, or termination of accreditation recognition, for accreditors’ poor performance or violations of federal civil rights law.\n\n(One might reasonably see this as groundwork to suspend existing accreditors and replace them with more administration friendly/industry unfriendly accreditors)\n\n– The Order mandates the Secretary of Education realign accreditation with student-focused principles by:\n\n\n– Prioritizing intellectual diversity among faculty in order to advance academic freedom, intellectual inquiry, and student learning.\n\n(Viewpoint diversity is perhaps better know as affirmative action for underrepresented political view points)\n\n\n\n\nEO on foreign monies\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/\n\nWith the U.S. cracking down on student loan payments, is college still worth it?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/25/student-loan-payments-collections-college-affordability/\nThis columnists answer: community college for the win\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s destructive war on academia\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/19/trump-harvard-irs-nixon-universities/\n\nPresident Donald Trump has launched a public blitzkrieg against Harvard. On Monday, he froze $2.2 billion in federal funding after the university rejected a far-reaching list of contradictory demands, including the hiring of an external auditor to evaluate the “viewpoint diversity” of its students, faculty, staff and leadership. On Wednesday, Treasury asked the IRS to consider revoking Harvard’s tax-exempt status. (Donations to the university could dry up if they’re not tax-deductible.) Next, the Department of Homeland Security threatened to revoke Harvard’s ability to host international students, who make up 27 percent of the student body. In the coming months, Trump and congressional allies hope to impose devastating taxes on university endowment funds — Vice President Vance has suggested as high as 35 percent — and plan to scrutinize their investments in China and clean energy.\n\n\nAcademic freedom is worth defending. In the long term, this might require colleges to reduce their dependence on federal dollars. In the short term, schools should stick together to resist Trump’s unlawful dictates on what they teach and whom they hire. It is heartening that Harvard’s defiance is already helping to stiffen the backbones of college administrators elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Cornell Cancels Kehlani Performance Over Her Stance on the War in Gaza\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/nyregion/kehlani-cornell-concert-replaced.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump and Vance fear universities for a reason\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4juE7ow\n\nPresident Trump has tested his authority with such force that other institutions—universities, law firms and many lawmakers—have started to fight back\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-authority-resistance-law-firms-universities-424632ae?st=ZS9Wx4&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nCan Colleges Survive Trump’s Cuts\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/can-colleges-survive-trumps-cuts\n\nThe cost of Trump’s proposals could exceed $100 million per year for dozens of institutions, according to analysis by the economist Phillip Levine. And yet the Trump administration has gone even further by withholding nearly all federal grant funding from some elite institutions. Columbia University tried to preserve $400 million in federal funding by agreeing to a list of onerous federal demands that get into the minutiae of academic governance, but even that has not satisfied the federal government.\n\n\nBlue-state public flagship universities are likely the next target, and even institutions that avoid such politicized attention are likely to suffer from structural cuts in federal grants and contracts. These cuts have happened so suddenly that some universities began to take action immediately in order to preserve cash flow, a key lesson from the pandemic. But this is also a longer-term financial issue as 45 months remain in the Trump administration, and there is no guarantee that federal funding returns to normal in 2029.\n\n(Of the 4 steps suggested, only “Conduct layoffs and hiring and spending freezes” appears applicable to CUNY.)\n\nTo this point, the federal government has promised that financial aid to students, the largest source of federal funding to most universities, will not be affected by cuts elsewhere in the Department of Education. But it is possible that the federal government tries to selectively pull federal financial-aid eligibility,\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Tried to Derail Our Work.

European universities are courting top American scientists and researchers en masse with offers of “academic asylum.” The European Research Council has doubled the funding it offers researchers to move to the continent to €2 million ($2.3 million). A bloc of 12 EU nations are working together to fast-track visas, Horizon Europe grants, and relocation stipends in an effort to poach U.S. brainpower in accordance with their own strategic priorities.\n\n(Scientists leaving Germany in 1939 was one of three reasons for the growth in US research accomplishments in the Zakaria op-ed https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/25/us-losing-competitive-edge-science/)\n\n\n\n\nWhite House Partners With Hillsdale for Lecture Series\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/25/white-house-partners-hillsdale-lecture-series\n\nThe Trump administration also worked with Hillsdale at the end of the president’s first term.

And so in order to build a mafia state, such an aspiring patron needs to strip other agents of their money and power.\n\n\nAnd it has the ability to, if not bankrupt universities — it certainly has the ability to bankrupt universities that don’t have significant endowments, which is most of them.\n\n\nThe only way for universities to really address this is to come to terms with the fact that there is no way for them, with this administration, to keep their federal money.\n\n\nFor more on the steps the administration has signaled it might do to gain obesiance, this AAUP white paper from 2024 offers much insight (shared by VC):\n\nhttps://www.aaup.org/file/Manufacturing_Backlash_final_1.pdf\n\nwe have witnessed what one scholar correctly called an “unusually brazen series of challenges to academic freedom,” unleashed by conservative activists and a “national-level political machine” … to undermine academic freedom and university autonomy.\n\nIncluding academic gag orders seeking to ban the teaching of “critical race theory” (CRT); shuttering academic programs; dismantling institutional efforts to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion; weaken tenure protections for faculty; undermined the accreditation process; establish academic programs, centers, and whole schools designed to teach conservative content;\n\nAs this white paper demonstrates, however, this legislation is largely the outgrowth of efforts by right-wing and libertarian think tanks, working closely with Republican politicians, to manufacture a culture-war backlash against educators and academic institutions … as part of a well-organized and well-funded backlash that seeks to roll back the political, social, and cultural gains made in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement increased queer and trans visibility.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Insatiable\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/trump-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n&lt; In order to function effectively, Democracies depend on the ability of the electorate to make what Jackson calls “informed choices.” In this context, Jackson writes, “Knowledge institutions — including universities, the truth-oriented press, government offices with data collection or scientific responsibilities — are crucial for constitutional democracies.”",

She received no official explanation for why the grant was being terminated more than a year ahead of its scheduled end. But Dr. Fiesler speculated that it had something to do with the word “misinformation” in the award’s abstract.\n\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the N.S.F. said that its grant cancellations were not in violation of the temporary restraining order. When asked by The Times to provide clarification on the legality of the grant cancellations, the agency declined to comment.\n\n\nLast Thursday, the magazine Nature reported that all new research grants by the agency had been frozen, as ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The N.S.F. declined to confirm the freezing of new awards or what role, if any, DOGE had in the action.\n\n\nNSF Director Resigns\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/25/nsf-director-panchanathan-resigns\n\nHis resignation comes less than one week after he issued sweeping priority changes—including terminating funding for projects that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion or combating misinformation—at the independent agency that funds billions of dollars to nonmedical university research each year.\n\n\n“I believe that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency and feel that it is time to pass the baton to new leadership,” Panchanathan wrote in a resignation letter, first reported by Science. “I am deeply grateful to the presidents for the opportunity to serve our nation.”\n\n\nUnder Panchanathan’s leadership, the NSF’s stated priorities have included increasing diversity in the STEM workforce, forming industry partnerships, job creation and broadening research opportunities for smaller universities and community colleges.\n\n\nTrump is destroying 100 years of competitive advantage in 100 days\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/25/us-losing-competitive-edge-science/\n\nAll three of these forces are now being reversed.

But CUNY is not a university with deep pockets. We don’t have an endowment that we can draw on for these kinds of things.”\n\nIn the Chancellor’s “Stand Together” email we have:\n\nWe are evaluating how changes to funding from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy and other federal agencies will impact our research and programming. Cuts in NIH reimbursements, for example, for operational costs of research and training are being challenged in court, but should they be carried out we estimate that CUNY would receive only about 35% of our expected $12.7 million payment on currently active grants.

The letters didn’t say what this and other requests were for.\n\n\nThe Florida DOGE also requested information on all grants awarded to institutions over the last six years, asking for each institution’s policy on allocating grants “for purposes of indirect cost recovery, including procedures for calculation.” Further, it requested an account of “all filled and vacant positions held by any employee with a non-instructional role.”\n\n\nBy the end of April, Florida’s public institutions must also provide the “Length of research associated” with each research publication, funding sources associated with the research and any “publications about the research” from the researcher or institution. In addition, the state DOGE is requesting funding sources for each institution’s noninstructional positions and the names of the nonstudent employees administering the grants.\n\n\nAnd that may not be the end of the DOGE demands…",

Another order instructed his administration to make it more difficult for universities to obscure details of foreign funding.\n\n\nTwo other orders focused on student discipline, which has been a political flashpoint for the past decade.\n\n\nOne order was to ensure that disciplinary policies were not based on D.E.I. policies.

On Monday, he froze $2.2 billion in federal funding after the university rejected a far-reaching list of contradictory demands, including the hiring of an external auditor to evaluate the “viewpoint diversity” of its students, faculty, staff and leadership. On Wednesday, Treasury asked the IRS to consider revoking Harvard’s tax-exempt status. (Donations to the university could dry up if they’re not tax-deductible.) Next, the Department of Homeland Security threatened to revoke Harvard’s ability to host international students, who make up 27 percent of the student body. In the coming months, Trump and congressional allies hope to impose devastating taxes on university endowment funds — Vice President Vance has suggested as high as 35 percent — and plan to scrutinize their investments in China and clean energy.\n\n\nAcademic freedom is worth defending. In the long term, this might require colleges to reduce their dependence on federal dollars. In the short term, schools should stick together to resist Trump’s unlawful dictates on what they teach and whom they hire. It is heartening that Harvard’s defiance is already helping to stiffen the backbones of college administrators elsewhere.",

And yet the Trump administration has gone even further by withholding nearly all federal grant funding from some elite institutions. Columbia University tried to preserve $400 million in federal funding by agreeing to a list of onerous federal demands that get into the minutiae of academic governance, but even that has not satisfied the federal government.\n\n\nBlue-state public flagship universities are likely the next target, and even institutions that avoid such politicized attention are likely to suffer from structural cuts in federal grants and contracts. These cuts have happened so suddenly that some universities began to take action immediately in order to preserve cash flow, a key lesson from the pandemic. But this is also a longer-term financial issue as 45 months remain in the Trump administration, and there is no guarantee that federal funding returns to normal in 2029.\n\n(Of the 4 steps suggested, only “Conduct layoffs and hiring and spending freezes” appears applicable to CUNY.)\n\nTo this point, the federal government has promised that financial aid to students, the largest source of federal funding to most universities, will not be affected by cuts elsewhere in the Department of Education.

Why Do We Treat Them So Poorly?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/opinion/teachers-education-trump-administration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(SUNY Chancellor on the impact of teachers.)\n\n\n\n\nThe New Dark Age\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/trump-defund-schools-research-republicans/682742/?gift=Je3D9AQS-C17lUTOnl2W8DWsF0Ye4dzmUZWM5fDSO2g&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share\n(This is a crystal clear piece about where this administration is trying to steer things and it is not a good place. It is well worth getting past the paywall to read/)\n\nThe warlords who sacked Rome did not intend to doom Western Europe to centuries of ignorance. It was not a foreseeable consequence of their actions. The same cannot be said of the sweeping attack on human knowledge and progress that the Trump administration is now undertaking—a deliberate destruction of education, science, and history, conducted with a fanaticism that recalls the Dark Ages that followed Rome’s fall.\n\n\nEvery week brings fresh examples. The administration is threatening colleges and universities with the loss of federal funding if they do not submit to its demands, or even if they do. The engines of American scientific inquiry and ingenuity, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, are under sustained attack. Historical institutions such as the Smithsonian and artistic ones like the Kennedy Center are being converted into homes for MAGA ideology rather than historical fact and free expression. Libraries are losing funding, government-employed scientists are being dismissed from their jobs, educators are being cowed into silence, and researchers are being warned not to broach forbidden subjects. Entire databases of public-health information collected over decades are at risk of vanishing. Any facts that contradict the gospel of Trumpism are treated as heretical.\n\n\nLike the inquisitors of old, who persecuted Galileo for daring to notice that the sun did not, in fact, revolve around the Earth, they believe that truth-seeking imperils their hold on power.\n\n\nBut a massive technological stall is only the most apparent aspect of the coming damage. The attack on knowledge also threatens the country’s ability to address subtler social problems, such as racial and economic inequalities in health, opportunity, and civil rights. Research into these disparities is being cut across government and civil society in the name of defeating so-called wokeness. Invoked as a general criticism of left-wing excess, the fight against “wokeness” is destroying huge swaths of scholarship and research, for fear the results might make the case for racial or gender equality, the redistribution of wealth, or the regulation of industry.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s Politics of Plunder\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/donald-trumps-politics-of-plunder\n\nHistorically, ruling billionaires have tried to avoid such portraits. (A publicist for J. P. Morgan used to say that he was “paid to keep the bank out of the press.”) But the Trump Presidency has embraced an unusually open marriage of politics and profit. Official filings revealed that his Inauguration fund set a new record by collecting some two hundred and fifty million dollars from corporations, C.E.O.s, and other large donors. The biggest donation, five million dollars, came from a major poultry producer called Pilgrim’s Pride. A few months later, Trump’s Agriculture Secretary delighted the industry by agreeing not to increase salmonella testing and promising to cut “unnecessary bureaucracy.” By then, Trump had already fired the director of the Office of Government Ethics and the head of the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates whistle-blower complaints.\n\n\non-one conversations with the President have become available for five million. The return on investment is uncertain, a government-affairs executive told me: “What if he’s in a bad mood? You have no clue where the money is eventually going.” Another lobbying veteran described the frank exchange as “outer-borough Mafia shit.”\n\n\nThe ultra-rich have captured more of America’s wealth than even the nineteenth-century tycoons of the Gilded Age. Scholars who study inequality as far back as the Neolithic period struggle to find precedents. Tim Kerig, an archeologist who directs the Museum Alzey, in Germany, told me, “The people who built the Egyptian pyramids were probably in a less unequal society.” He suggested that today’s richest people are simply accumulating too much wealth for the system to contain. “The economic and technical evolution is much faster than the social, mental, and ideological evolution,” he said. “We had no time to adapt to all those billionaires.”\n\n\nFor fifteen years, the Patriotic Millionaires have waged an earnest battle to persuade wealthy people to lobby for higher taxes on themselves. This has often been a lonesome endeavor, but Trump’s assault on democracy, financed by some of America’s richest people, has fortified the group’s arguments. Scott Ellis, a member who used to run a consulting group at Hewlett-Packard, told me that even skeptical peers in Silicon Valley had become increasingly receptive. “Some friends used to humor me, but they’re listening more,” he said.\n\n\nIn the 2004 election, according to Americans for Tax Fairness, billionaires gave thirteen million dollars in political contributions; twenty years later, the country’s richest families spent more than two hundred times that much. Payne told the crowd, “There’s a point where money is no longer money. It is power—and they’re using that power to screw life up for everybody else.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas House OKs more state oversight of public universities | The Texas Tribune\n\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/24/texas-governing-boards-regents-senate-bill-37/\n\nSenate Bill 37 passed in an 83-53 vote Saturday. It would create a state-level committee that would recommend courses that should be required for graduation and how to condense the number of those courses. Meanwhile, each public university system’s board of regents, who oversee the school’s operations and are appointed by the governor, would be charged with creating a committee to review curricula and reject any course deemed ideologically charged or that doesn’t align with the workforce demands. Specifically, the committees would ensure curricula do not “advocate or promote that any race, sex, ethnicity or religious belief is inherently superior to any other.”\n\n(This bill if passed is much more than a glancing blow to higher education’s principles.)\n\nIn Defense of Academic Freedom - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/05/in-defense-of-academic-freedom/682914/\n\nWhy defend academic freedom even when the ideas in question are wrongheaded or harmful? “It is precisely because any kind of purge opens the gate to all kinds of purge, that freedom of thought necessarily means the freedom to think bad thoughts as well as good.”\n\n\nThose words, written in 1953 by Joseph Alsop, an alumnus of Harvard who later served on its Board of Overseers, are relevant today, as the Trump administration cancels the visas of foreign students for viewpoints that it deems “bad.” And they were relevant in recent years as institutions of higher education investigated and disciplined members of their communities for expressing views that ran afoul of various progressive social-justice orthodoxies. But Alsop wrote them in response to the McCarthy era’s efforts to identify and punish Communists who were working in academia.\n\n\nA Tumultuous Spring Semester Finally Comes to a Close | The New Yorker\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/a-tumultuous-spring-semester-finally-comes-to-a-close\n\nThe biggest mistake that some universities have made is to presume that the White House is operating in good faith. It is not.\n\n\nAcademic freedom in the United States has found itself periodically under siege. In March, Ellen Schrecker, a historian and the author of “No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities,” spoke via Zoom to deans at Columbia (including myself) about government repression on college campuses in the nineteen-fifties. Schrecker, who has taught at both Columbia and Harvard and retired as a professor at Yeshiva University, emphasized the severity of the current climate. “I’ve studied McCarthyism’s impact on higher education for fifty years,” she said. “What’s happening now is worse.” This is in part because universities today are far more beholden to the federal government. The explosive expansion of higher education that began after the Second World War was underwritten by federal dollars. So members of Congress, and President Trump, too, have leverage that demagogues who preceded them could only dream of.\n\n\nMordecai Johnson was a Black man leading an academic institution during Jim Crow when representatives from an almost entirely white Congress asked him whether professors with radical sympathies should be allowed to teach at Howard. Yet he firmly said that he would sooner shut down his university than allow anyone to dictate what its students could or could not learn. The principle at play—that without free inquiry there is no basis for a university to exist—still applies.\n\n\nUtah Lawmakers Flex Their Power Over Public Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/05/28/new-utah-law-prompts-program-cuts-strategic\n(Thanks SC for sharing and caring)\n\nPublic colleges and universities in Utah are set to lose roughly $60 million in July—or 10 percent of their state-funded instructional budgets—but they can earn back that money by cutting programs and positions and investing in other areas considered worthy by state lawmakers, under a law passed this spring.\n\n\nHB 265 is just one example of how Republicans in Utah’s State House are trying to exert more control over public higher education and shape colleges’ academic programs and services. The changes have raised concerns among faculty, who see their traditional academic freedom and shared governance roles in setting curricula and other areas being usurped.\n\n\nSince 2024, lawmakers have mandated post-tenure review; banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and offices; and banned pride flags, Juneteenth flags and others from “prominent” campus locations. They’ve also created a Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that faculty appointed to that center teach all the university’s general education courses while serving on short-term, at-will contracts.\n\n\nAs for university administrators, Gerdes [president of the University of Utah’s AAUP chapter] said, “Our administration wants to have a healthy working relationship with the State Legislature. I think that they are less concerned about having a healthy relationship with their own faculty.”\n\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune reported that university president Taylor R. Randall cited a 2024 law, Senate Bill 192, on the limits of faculty governance to silence an Academic Senate discussion in February that was critical of his provost.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nRFK Jr. says he may bar scientists from publishing in top medical journals\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/rfk-jr-ban-journals-lancet-jama/\n\n“We’re probably going to stop publishing in the Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA and those other journals because they’re all corrupt,” Kennedy said during an appearance on the “Ultimate Human” podcast. He also described the journals as being under the control of pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\nOn his plans for the department to create its own journals, Kennedy said they would “become the preeminent journals, because if you get [NIH] funding, it is anointing you as a good, legitimate scientist.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump addresses a West Point upended by his changes\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/24/trump-west-point-graduation-dei-military/\n\nHe said that as president, he had rebuilt the military “better than ever before” and rid it of “social experiments” like the teaching of critical race theory and efforts to support transgender soldiers. And he took credit for a rise in military recruitment.\n\n\n“It’s a feeling of real whiplash,” said Graham Parsons, a former West Point professor who resigned from America’s oldest service academy after publicly criticizing the impact of Trump’s policies. “We used to raise the possibility that in the military and beyond, there are still real structural problems with racism and sexism. That would not fly now.”\n\n\nNYTimes: For Trump, Civil Rights Protections Should Help White Men\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/us/politics/trump-race-civil-right-white-men.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAnd last month, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission launched an investigation at Harvard University, alleging that the school had engaged in discriminatory hiring because it showed a significant increase in the percentage of minority, female and nonbinary faculty earning tenure over the past decade while the rates for white men declined.\n\n\nConservatives have denounced disparate impact because it relies on outcome data to allege and prove discrimination — the basis on which Ms. Lucas lodged her charge against Harvard.\n\n\nHow Harmeet Dhillon is engineering a U-turn in the Justice Department’s civil-rights division\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/harmeet-dhillons-civil-rights-revolution-comes-with-tea-and-roses-ff9b1874?st=s7pVVz&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(An attempt at a flattering profile, but don’t be put led astray)\n\n“What we’re seeing now is a complete gutting of all the traditional work of the civil-rights division and then a rump of the civil-rights division being used almost exclusively to pursue right-wing Trumpist agenda items,” said Samuel Bagenstos, a former senior civil-rights official in the Obama Justice Department.\n\n\nUncle Sam’s new message to young Black Americans: I don’t want you\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/27/trump-military-hostile-black-americans/\n\nTrump and his allies have pushed aggressively to defund or eliminate DEI programs across the military. One of Trump’s first actions was to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., only the second African American ever to hold that position. Training on racial bias, cultural competency and inclusive leadership has been gutted and labeled “radical.” Officers who speak up about race or systemic injustice are accused of pushing “politics,” while those promoting exclusionary rhetoric are celebrated as patriots.\n\n\nThe message is clear: If you’re Black, Brown or anything other than the old guard — a White male — your presence in the military is conditional and increasingly unwelcome.\n\n\nThe Era of DEI for Conservatives Has Begun\n\n(Thanks BE)\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/conservative-professors-dei-initiatives/682944/?gift=yCYg0MdUGpnvquf3En3lpjtTtgMgla5OiobYjP9Hxt4&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share\n\nLegislatures in red and purple states across the country have shoveled money into universities to establish schools of civic thought, which are marketed as the conservative answer to academia’s leftward drift and the rise of identity-oriented disciplines.\n\n\nRepublicans have unfairly smeared affirmative action as a way to hire people “based on their race and not on their qualifications.” Now they’re the ones who want to hire professors based on their politics, not their fitness for the role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. has more than 1 million foreign students.

What Are the Consequences?\n\nhttps://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/trump-cancels-federal-research-grants-what-are-consequences\n\nLast August, Jaafar [professor in the math, engineering and computer science department at LaGuardia Community College] realized a long-held dream of hers to win a NSF grant: $530,002 aimed at boosting students’ success in STEM degrees (and consequently their success in New York City’s workplaces). This grant-funded work would have involved about 40 faculty members directly, plus many more through a robust diffusion model, says Jaafar, providing the kind of professional development that leads to “long-term behavioral change, so that faculty become change agents,” she said. “You go through this transformation and then you’re able to transform others.”\n\n\nOver the three years, Jaafar estimates that trained faculty would have influenced about 5,000 students at LaGuardia, a formally designated Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). “Without making these investments, we’re going to enforce the longstanding barriers to access—and we’ll actually be falling short in workforce needs,” she says.\n\n\nThese aren’t the only NSF grants to CUNY institutions that have been terminated. Indeed, about $17 million in grants have been targeted, including the following:\n\n\nA $1 million grant to Queensborough Community College, Queens College and LaGuardia to develop a program that trains students in the emerging field of wastewater-based epidemiology. The goal was to train about 200 students for public-service jobs.\n\n\nA $1 million grant to LaGuardia, City Tech, which is a 4-year college, and the biotechnology company Schrödinger to create a program that provides hands-on, experiential learning and paid internships.\n\n\nA $700,000 grant to the College of Staten Island to increase students’ sense of belonging and retention through peer-led team learning. Already, this project was achieving dramatic increases in passing rates, but because of the grant’s termination its paid peer leaders have been dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Fulbright Applicants, a DEI Disqualifier\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/us-colleges-world/2025/05/29/fulbright-applicants-rejected-over-dei-research-proposals\n\nInside Higher Ed obtained a copy of Rubio’s cable, which says that this year State Department officials would give the final sign-off; they have been tasked with rooting out any projects that could violate President Trump’s executive orders banning diversity, equity and inclusion.

But the administration holds the levers of power, and is methodically and creatively using them in a take-no-prisoners assault on the school.\n\n\n“I was dumbfounded,” Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, told me. “What’s becoming increasingly clear is that this administration will use any tool that it can.”\n\n\nMS [Michael Schmidt]: There’s been an audacity and creativity to the way that Trump has tried to use his power in the second term, and this is the latest example. Coming into this, we concentrated on his threats to lock up his enemies, like Liz Cheney or James Comey. The use of the government’s power for purely political ends has manifested itself in ways that I think go beyond what we had imagined, and even beyond what Project 2025 contemplated.\n\n\nHarvard officials have privately determined they are in a major, major, major crisis with very few, if any, good off ramps.\n\n(I hope we recognize that Harvard’s battle is the ultimate fight for academic freedom and the independence of higher education – the assault has no rational explanation; its destructiveness can’t be rationalized.)\n\nHarvard Digs In for Battle, but Trump’s Blows Are Landing\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-trump-lawsuits-fight-d5f8ec8a?st=27ignH&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nEven as Harvard looks to the courts for relief, faculty and administrators are making contingency plans and preparing for a drawn-out war with the Trump administration\n\n\nHarvard’s conundrum is that it cannot trust the Trump administration to negotiate in good faith nor can it count on winning an extended battle with the federal government, says Aziz Z. Huq, a law professor at the University of Chicago.\n\n\nThe result, Huq suggests, will be a reset not only for Harvard but across higher education. The current model for research universities was created during World War II, when the military outsourced its research and development to schools. That model served the nation well for decades but is increasingly under attack from MAGA conservatives who believe that higher education has become a hotbed of liberal ideology that needs to be torn down and rebuilt.\n\n(I’d rephrase that last part, but will amplify “That model served the nation well for decades” until the mis-informed got mid-informed.)\n\nThe government seems bent on destroying Harvard for the offense of fighting back.

Noem’s letter to Harvard makes clear that Trump and his sycophants will weaponize the state against anyone who incurs their displeasure. Courts may prevent the worst, but the whole pattern has to end if we want to have any hope of living in a country free of fear and featuring at least minimum respect for the rule of law.\n\n\nAs Harvard’s lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security rightly pointed out, Noem’s revocation fits into the Trump administration’s orgy of vengeance prompted by Harvard’s refusal to comply with evidently illegal demands issued in mid-April.\n\n\nWe can draw larger lessons from this – so far – failed attack (eight investigations, involving six different agencies, are still ongoing). One has to be ready – Harvard’s lawyers clearly were. Universities have to stand with each other; Noem warned all of them that they have to “get their act together” or else. Not least, university leaders have to explain to a larger public how Trumpists, in an unprecedented spree of national self-destruction, are busy preventing cancer cures, damaging American soft power, and killing one of the country’s major exports, namely higher education.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Attacks Have Helped Heal a Deeply Divided Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/us/trump-attacks-unify-divided-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDoes the President Want to Fix Harvard or Destroy It? by @jasonrileywsj\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/opinion/does-the-president-want-to-fix-harvard-or-destroy-it-0bf083d1?st=Ya1Vwx&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(destroy… even the WSJ recognizes this…)\n\nNYTimes: Harvard and Trump Lawyers to Face Off in Court in Foreign Student Case\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/harvard-trump-lawyers-hearing-foreign-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn the courtroom, Harvard’s strategy will use the president’s statements as evidence that the government is on a political crusade against the school.

The Trump administration is all in; is higher ed?)\n\nWhile international students make up slightly more than 5 percent of university students nationwide, some of the nation’s most selective schools rely far more heavily on them. At New York University, home to nearly 60,000 students, one-third of them are international. At Columbia, about two in five students come from abroad. And at Harvard, more than a quarter of students come from across the globe.\n\n\n“This sends a signal to the rest of the world that not only is Harvard closed to the international best and brightest, but that the U.S. is not a welcome place for international students,” Mr. Lakhani said [admissions counselor in New York].\n\n\nTrump’s war on America’s Ivy League universities didn’t start with the 2023 anti-Israel protests.

It is well worth getting past the paywall to read/)\n\nThe warlords who sacked Rome did not intend to doom Western Europe to centuries of ignorance. It was not a foreseeable consequence of their actions. The same cannot be said of the sweeping attack on human knowledge and progress that the Trump administration is now undertaking—a deliberate destruction of education, science, and history, conducted with a fanaticism that recalls the Dark Ages that followed Rome’s fall.\n\n\nEvery week brings fresh examples. The administration is threatening colleges and universities with the loss of federal funding if they do not submit to its demands, or even if they do. The engines of American scientific inquiry and ingenuity, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, are under sustained attack. Historical institutions such as the Smithsonian and artistic ones like the Kennedy Center are being converted into homes for MAGA ideology rather than historical fact and free expression. Libraries are losing funding, government-employed scientists are being dismissed from their jobs, educators are being cowed into silence, and researchers are being warned not to broach forbidden subjects. Entire databases of public-health information collected over decades are at risk of vanishing. Any facts that contradict the gospel of Trumpism are treated as heretical.\n\n\nLike the inquisitors of old, who persecuted Galileo for daring to notice that the sun did not, in fact, revolve around the Earth, they believe that truth-seeking imperils their hold on power.\n\n\nBut a massive technological stall is only the most apparent aspect of the coming damage. The attack on knowledge also threatens the country’s ability to address subtler social problems, such as racial and economic inequalities in health, opportunity, and civil rights. Research into these disparities is being cut across government and civil society in the name of defeating so-called wokeness. Invoked as a general criticism of left-wing excess, the fight against “wokeness” is destroying huge swaths of scholarship and research, for fear the results might make the case for racial or gender equality, the redistribution of wealth, or the regulation of industry.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s Politics of Plunder\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/donald-trumps-politics-of-plunder\n\nHistorically, ruling billionaires have tried to avoid such portraits. (A publicist for J. P. Morgan used to say that he was “paid to keep the bank out of the press.”) But the Trump Presidency has embraced an unusually open marriage of politics and profit. Official filings revealed that his Inauguration fund set a new record by collecting some two hundred and fifty million dollars from corporations, C.E.O.s, and other large donors. The biggest donation, five million dollars, came from a major poultry producer called Pilgrim’s Pride. A few months later, Trump’s Agriculture Secretary delighted the industry by agreeing not to increase salmonella testing and promising to cut “unnecessary bureaucracy.” By then, Trump had already fired the director of the Office of Government Ethics and the head of the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates whistle-blower complaints.\n\n\non-one conversations with the President have become available for five million. The return on investment is uncertain, a government-affairs executive told me: “What if he’s in a bad mood? You have no clue where the money is eventually going.” Another lobbying veteran described the frank exchange as “outer-borough Mafia shit.”\n\n\nThe ultra-rich have captured more of America’s wealth than even the nineteenth-century tycoons of the Gilded Age. Scholars who study inequality as far back as the Neolithic period struggle to find precedents. Tim Kerig, an archeologist who directs the Museum Alzey, in Germany, told me, “The people who built the Egyptian pyramids were probably in a less unequal society.” He suggested that today’s richest people are simply accumulating too much wealth for the system to contain. “The economic and technical evolution is much faster than the social, mental, and ideological evolution,” he said. “We had no time to adapt to all those billionaires.”\n\n\nFor fifteen years, the Patriotic Millionaires have waged an earnest battle to persuade wealthy people to lobby for higher taxes on themselves. This has often been a lonesome endeavor, but Trump’s assault on democracy, financed by some of America’s richest people, has fortified the group’s arguments. Scott Ellis, a member who used to run a consulting group at Hewlett-Packard, told me that even skeptical peers in Silicon Valley had become increasingly receptive. “Some friends used to humor me, but they’re listening more,” he said.\n\n\nIn the 2004 election, according to Americans for Tax Fairness, billionaires gave thirteen million dollars in political contributions; twenty years later, the country’s richest families spent more than two hundred times that much. Payne told the crowd, “There’s a point where money is no longer money. It is power—and they’re using that power to screw life up for everybody else.”",

    "text": "Texas House OKs more state oversight of public universities | The Texas Tribune\n\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/24/texas-governing-boards-regents-senate-bill-37/\n\nSenate Bill 37 passed in an 83-53 vote Saturday. It would create a state-level committee that would recommend courses that should be required for graduation and how to condense the number of those courses. Meanwhile, each public university system’s board of regents, who oversee the school’s operations and are appointed by the governor, would be charged with creating a committee to review curricula and reject any course deemed ideologically charged or that doesn’t align with the workforce demands. Specifically, the committees would ensure curricula do not “advocate or promote that any race, sex, ethnicity or religious belief is inherently superior to any other.”\n\n(This bill if passed is much more than a glancing blow to higher education’s principles.)\n\nIn Defense of Academic Freedom - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/05/in-defense-of-academic-freedom/682914/\n\nWhy defend academic freedom even when the ideas in question are wrongheaded or harmful? “It is precisely because any kind of purge opens the gate to all kinds of purge, that freedom of thought necessarily means the freedom to think bad thoughts as well as good.”\n\n\nThose words, written in 1953 by Joseph Alsop, an alumnus of Harvard who later served on its Board of Overseers, are relevant today, as the Trump administration cancels the visas of foreign students for viewpoints that it deems “bad.” And they were relevant in recent years as institutions of higher education investigated and disciplined members of their communities for expressing views that ran afoul of various progressive social-justice orthodoxies. But Alsop wrote them in response to the McCarthy era’s efforts to identify and punish Communists who were working in academia.\n\n\nA Tumultuous Spring Semester Finally Comes to a Close | The New Yorker\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/a-tumultuous-spring-semester-finally-comes-to-a-close\n\nThe biggest mistake that some universities have made is to presume that the White House is operating in good faith. It is not.\n\n\nAcademic freedom in the United States has found itself periodically under siege. In March, Ellen Schrecker, a historian and the author of “No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities,” spoke via Zoom to deans at Columbia (including myself) about government repression on college campuses in the nineteen-fifties. Schrecker, who has taught at both Columbia and Harvard and retired as a professor at Yeshiva University, emphasized the severity of the current climate. “I’ve studied McCarthyism’s impact on higher education for fifty years,” she said. “What’s happening now is worse.” This is in part because universities today are far more beholden to the federal government. The explosive expansion of higher education that began after the Second World War was underwritten by federal dollars. So members of Congress, and President Trump, too, have leverage that demagogues who preceded them could only dream of.\n\n\nMordecai Johnson was a Black man leading an academic institution during Jim Crow when representatives from an almost entirely white Congress asked him whether professors with radical sympathies should be allowed to teach at Howard. Yet he firmly said that he would sooner shut down his university than allow anyone to dictate what its students could or could not learn. The principle at play—that without free inquiry there is no basis for a university to exist—still applies.\n\n\nUtah Lawmakers Flex Their Power Over Public Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/05/28/new-utah-law-prompts-program-cuts-strategic\n(Thanks SC for sharing and caring)\n\nPublic colleges and universities in Utah are set to lose roughly $60 million in July—or 10 percent of their state-funded instructional budgets—but they can earn back that money by cutting programs and positions and investing in other areas considered worthy by state lawmakers, under a law passed this spring.\n\n\nHB 265 is just one example of how Republicans in Utah’s State House are trying to exert more control over public higher education and shape colleges’ academic programs and services. The changes have raised concerns among faculty, who see their traditional academic freedom and shared governance roles in setting curricula and other areas being usurped.\n\n\nSince 2024, lawmakers have mandated post-tenure review; banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and offices; and banned pride flags, Juneteenth flags and others from “prominent” campus locations. They’ve also created a Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that faculty appointed to that center teach all the university’s general education courses while serving on short-term, at-will contracts.\n\n\nAs for university administrators, Gerdes [president of the University of Utah’s AAUP chapter] said, “Our administration wants to have a healthy working relationship with the State Legislature. I think that they are less concerned about having a healthy relationship with their own faculty.”\n\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune reported that university president Taylor R. Randall cited a 2024 law, Senate Bill 192, on the limits of faculty governance to silence an Academic Senate discussion in February that was critical of his provost.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nRFK Jr. says he may bar scientists from publishing in top medical journals\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/rfk-jr-ban-journals-lancet-jama/\n\n“We’re probably going to stop publishing in the Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA and those other journals because they’re all corrupt,” Kennedy said during an appearance on the “Ultimate Human” podcast. He also described the journals as being under the control of pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\nOn his plans for the department to create its own journals, Kennedy said they would “become the preeminent journals, because if you get [NIH] funding, it is anointing you as a good, legitimate scientist.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump addresses a West Point upended by his changes\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/24/trump-west-point-graduation-dei-military/\n\nHe said that as president, he had rebuilt the military “better than ever before” and rid it of “social experiments” like the teaching of critical race theory and efforts to support transgender soldiers. And he took credit for a rise in military recruitment.\n\n\n“It’s a feeling of real whiplash,” said Graham Parsons, a former West Point professor who resigned from America’s oldest service academy after publicly criticizing the impact of Trump’s policies. “We used to raise the possibility that in the military and beyond, there are still real structural problems with racism and sexism. That would not fly now.”\n\n\nNYTimes: For Trump, Civil Rights Protections Should Help White Men\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/us/politics/trump-race-civil-right-white-men.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAnd last month, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission launched an investigation at Harvard University, alleging that the school had engaged in discriminatory hiring because it showed a significant increase in the percentage of minority, female and nonbinary faculty earning tenure over the past decade while the rates for white men declined.\n\n\nConservatives have denounced disparate impact because it relies on outcome data to allege and prove discrimination — the basis on which Ms. Lucas lodged her charge against Harvard.\n\n\nHow Harmeet Dhillon is engineering a U-turn in the Justice Department’s civil-rights division\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/harmeet-dhillons-civil-rights-revolution-comes-with-tea-and-roses-ff9b1874?st=s7pVVz&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(An attempt at a flattering profile, but don’t be put led astray)\n\n“What we’re seeing now is a complete gutting of all the traditional work of the civil-rights division and then a rump of the civil-rights division being used almost exclusively to pursue right-wing Trumpist agenda items,” said Samuel Bagenstos, a former senior civil-rights official in the Obama Justice Department.\n\n\nUncle Sam’s new message to young Black Americans: I don’t want you\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/27/trump-military-hostile-black-americans/\n\nTrump and his allies have pushed aggressively to defund or eliminate DEI programs across the military. One of Trump’s first actions was to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., only the second African American ever to hold that position. Training on racial bias, cultural competency and inclusive leadership has been gutted and labeled “radical.” Officers who speak up about race or systemic injustice are accused of pushing “politics,” while those promoting exclusionary rhetoric are celebrated as patriots.\n\n\nThe message is clear: If you’re Black, Brown or anything other than the old guard — a White male — your presence in the military is conditional and increasingly unwelcome.\n\n\nThe Era of DEI for Conservatives Has Begun\n\n(Thanks BE)\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/conservative-professors-dei-initiatives/682944/?gift=yCYg0MdUGpnvquf3En3lpjtTtgMgla5OiobYjP9Hxt4&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share\n\nLegislatures in red and purple states across the country have shoveled money into universities to establish schools of civic thought, which are marketed as the conservative answer to academia’s leftward drift and the rise of identity-oriented disciplines.\n\n\nRepublicans have unfairly smeared affirmative action as a way to hire people “based on their race and not on their qualifications.” Now they’re the ones who want to hire professors based on their politics, not their fitness for the role.",

The program aims to provide short-term, bridge funding to sustain critical research activities support the professional advancement of faculty, particularly junior and untenured faculty who face greater risk from funding disruptions.\n\n(Consult your provost if this applies to you.)\n\nNYTimes: Funding Cuts Are a ‘Gut Punch’ for STEM Education Researchers\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/science/trump-nsf-stem-education.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMore than half of the National Science Foundation grants terminated since April fund programs that would help students train in science, engineering and math.\n\n\nOne potential outcome of defunding a large portion of STEM education research is that the work may become more concentrated at larger universities that are able to provide alternative sources of funding.\n\n\n“STEM and STEM education research need to grow hand in hand,” Dr. Penuel said. “And if we stop funding education research, they won’t.”\n\n\n\n\nNew York sues National Science Foundation over research funding restrictions\n\n(Politico Pro email by By Maya Kaufman | 05/28/2025 04:42 PM EDT; thanks JC)\n\nThe growing list of canceled research projects includes 18 by the City University of New York to promote participation in STEM fields by women, minorities and people with disabilities, according to James’ office. Those projects were supported by $11 million in National Science Foundation funds.\n\n\nThe coalition of states seeks a court order ruling that the foundation’s policies are illegal and blocking them from being implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Cancels Federal Research Grants. What Are the Consequences?\n\nhttps://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/trump-cancels-federal-research-grants-what-are-consequences\n\nLast August, Jaafar [professor in the math, engineering and computer science department at LaGuardia Community College] realized a long-held dream of hers to win a NSF grant: $530,002 aimed at boosting students’ success in STEM degrees (and consequently their success in New York City’s workplaces). This grant-funded work would have involved about 40 faculty members directly, plus many more through a robust diffusion model, says Jaafar, providing the kind of professional development that leads to “long-term behavioral change, so that faculty become change agents,” she said. “You go through this transformation and then you’re able to transform others.”\n\n\nOver the three years, Jaafar estimates that trained faculty would have influenced about 5,000 students at LaGuardia, a formally designated Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). “Without making these investments, we’re going to enforce the longstanding barriers to access—and we’ll actually be falling short in workforce needs,” she says.\n\n\nThese aren’t the only NSF grants to CUNY institutions that have been terminated. Indeed, about $17 million in grants have been targeted, including the following:\n\n\nA $1 million grant to Queensborough Community College, Queens College and LaGuardia to develop a program that trains students in the emerging field of wastewater-based epidemiology. The goal was to train about 200 students for public-service jobs.\n\n\nA $1 million grant to LaGuardia, City Tech, which is a 4-year college, and the biotechnology company Schrödinger to create a program that provides hands-on, experiential learning and paid internships.\n\n\nA $700,000 grant to the College of Staten Island to increase students’ sense of belonging and retention through peer-led team learning. Already, this project was achieving dramatic increases in passing rates, but because of the grant’s termination its paid peer leaders have been dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Fulbright Applicants, a DEI Disqualifier\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/us-colleges-world/2025/05/29/fulbright-applicants-rejected-over-dei-research-proposals\n\nInside Higher Ed obtained a copy of Rubio’s cable, which says that this year State Department officials would give the final sign-off; they have been tasked with rooting out any projects that could violate President Trump’s executive orders banning diversity, equity and inclusion.

But the administration holds the levers of power, and is methodically and creatively using them in a take-no-prisoners assault on the school.\n\n\n“I was dumbfounded,” Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, told me. “What’s becoming increasingly clear is that this administration will use any tool that it can.”\n\n\nMS [Michael Schmidt]: There’s been an audacity and creativity to the way that Trump has tried to use his power in the second term, and this is the latest example. Coming into this, we concentrated on his threats to lock up his enemies, like Liz Cheney or James Comey. The use of the government’s power for purely political ends has manifested itself in ways that I think go beyond what we had imagined, and even beyond what Project 2025 contemplated.\n\n\nHarvard officials have privately determined they are in a major, major, major crisis with very few, if any, good off ramps.\n\n(I hope we recognize that Harvard’s battle is the ultimate fight for academic freedom and the independence of higher education – the assault has no rational explanation; its destructiveness can’t be rationalized.)\n\nHarvard Digs In for Battle, but Trump’s Blows Are Landing\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-trump-lawsuits-fight-d5f8ec8a?st=27ignH&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nEven as Harvard looks to the courts for relief, faculty and administrators are making contingency plans and preparing for a drawn-out war with the Trump administration\n\n\nHarvard’s conundrum is that it cannot trust the Trump administration to negotiate in good faith nor can it count on winning an extended battle with the federal government, says Aziz Z. Huq, a law professor at the University of Chicago.\n\n\nThe result, Huq suggests, will be a reset not only for Harvard but across higher education. The current model for research universities was created during World War II, when the military outsourced its research and development to schools. That model served the nation well for decades but is increasingly under attack from MAGA conservatives who believe that higher education has become a hotbed of liberal ideology that needs to be torn down and rebuilt.\n\n(I’d rephrase that last part, but will amplify “That model served the nation well for decades” until the mis-informed got mid-informed.)\n\nThe government seems bent on destroying Harvard for the offense of fighting back. And for what purpose?\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-harvard-dhs-foreign-students-kristi-noem-b8ac80ed?st=WwQp8f&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(After some back and forth, this line still hits:)\n\nThe Trump Administration seems to think it needs to destroy Harvard to save it.

Noem’s letter to Harvard makes clear that Trump and his sycophants will weaponize the state against anyone who incurs their displeasure. Courts may prevent the worst, but the whole pattern has to end if we want to have any hope of living in a country free of fear and featuring at least minimum respect for the rule of law.\n\n\nAs Harvard’s lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security rightly pointed out, Noem’s revocation fits into the Trump administration’s orgy of vengeance prompted by Harvard’s refusal to comply with evidently illegal demands issued in mid-April.\n\n\nWe can draw larger lessons from this – so far – failed attack (eight investigations, involving six different agencies, are still ongoing). One has to be ready – Harvard’s lawyers clearly were. Universities have to stand with each other; Noem warned all of them that they have to “get their act together” or else. Not least, university leaders have to explain to a larger public how Trumpists, in an unprecedented spree of national self-destruction, are busy preventing cancer cures, damaging American soft power, and killing one of the country’s major exports, namely higher education.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Attacks Have Helped Heal a Deeply Divided Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/us/trump-attacks-unify-divided-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDoes the President Want to Fix Harvard or Destroy It? by @jasonrileywsj\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/opinion/does-the-president-want-to-fix-harvard-or-destroy-it-0bf083d1?st=Ya1Vwx&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(destroy… even the WSJ recognizes this…)\n\nNYTimes: Harvard and Trump Lawyers to Face Off in Court in Foreign Student Case\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/harvard-trump-lawyers-hearing-foreign-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn the courtroom, Harvard’s strategy will use the president’s statements as evidence that the government is on a political crusade against the school. In briefs filed in the case, lawyers have argued Trump administration officials have unjustly singled out the university for punishment, violating its First Amendment rights. It has included the president’s aggressive comments as exhibits in its case.\n\n\nA visa ban would affect 7,000 students at Harvard. That includes 5,000 current students and another 2,000 in a program that allows students to stay and work for up to three years after they graduate.\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Says Many of Its Foreign Students Are Seeking to Transfer\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/harvard-international-students-transfers.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration’s efforts to halt Harvard University’s ability to enroll international students has sown “profound fear, concern, and confusion,” the university’s director of immigration services said in a court filing on Wednesday.\n\n\nCountless international students have asked about transferring, the director, Maureen Martin, wrote in the filing.\n\n\nNYTimes: Live Updates: Judge Will Block Trump From Barring Foreign Students at Harvard, For Now\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/29/us/harvard-trump?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: What to Know About Trump Officials’ Latest Move Against Columbia\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/nyregion/columbia-trump-jewish-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe move on Thursday appeared to reflect the administration’s unusual approach to slashing federal funding to colleges.\n\n\nHistorically, such cancellations would follow a lengthy review process. But, legal experts said, the Trump administration has not always adhered to standard procedure, taking swift action against universities’ finances and sometimes notifying news outlets before campus leaders.\n\n(Id est: sanewashing.)\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Fight Illustrates Trump’s Worldview: If He Attacks, It’s Your Fault\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/harvard-university-trump-administration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe “last thing” he [large, orange hair] wants to do is harm the storied jewel of American higher education, he said. But he had no choice. The university was fighting back.\n\n(By personalizing the battle, perhaps the wider assault goes unnoticed)\n\nIt’s a constant in Mr. Trump’s worldview: If he goes after someone or something, it is their fault, not his. They are responsible for his actions. Not him.\n\n\nA federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration’s efforts to deport Columbia University demonstrator Mahmoud Khalil were likely unconstitutional\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/mahmoud-khalil-deportation-unconstitutional-judge-194a0d4a?st=2MPd18&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Universities See Trump’s Harvard Move as a Threat to Them, Too\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/us/harvard-trump-international-students-impact.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMore than 5,000 miles away, Wendy Hensel, the president of the University of Hawaii, said that it was “reverberating across higher education.”\n\n(Had to add this quote, as I miss our old provost.)\n\nTo many academics, that was a clear signal that Mr. Trump was prepared to use any federal mechanism as leverage if he did not get what he wants.\n\n\n“While Harvard is the victim of the moment, it’s a warning and unprecedented attempt of a hostile federal government to erode the autonomy of all major universities in the U.S.,” said John Aubrey Douglass, a senior research fellow at the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n(Again, this week’s them. The Trump administration is all in; is higher ed?)\n\nWhile international students make up slightly more than 5 percent of university students nationwide, some of the nation’s most selective schools rely far more heavily on them. At New York University, home to nearly 60,000 students, one-third of them are international. At Columbia, about two in five students come from abroad. And at Harvard, more than a quarter of students come from across the globe.\n\n\n“This sends a signal to the rest of the world that not only is Harvard closed to the international best and brightest, but that the U.S. is not a welcome place for international students,” Mr. Lakhani said [admissions counselor in New York].\n\n\nTrump’s war on America’s Ivy League universities didn’t start with the 2023 anti-Israel protests. It was set off in 2019 by a sucker punch that left a man with a black eye.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-college-university-federal-funding-fight-91c2a274?st=4xm3Hq&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(I’m sure this rationale was used by the Project 2025 authors…)",

So, you can say that, in terms of the loss of freedom, most people feel unaffected. But what we need to get our fellow citizens to see is that it’s all connected, and that when due process is undermined even for a noncitizen, ultimately it can put everyone’s freedom in jeopardy. What lessons do you draw from other countries such as Hungary, India, Poland, Brazil, the Philippines, Turkey and Venezuela, all of which have seen democratic backsliding over the past few decades?\n\n\n The lessons are that people should unify and coordinate as quickly as possible. The more that institutions under threat try to just go their own way or duck for cover, the more they’ll be divided and picked off one by one.

They fear it could damage the institutions’ reputations and lead to a faculty brain drain.\n\n\nHis (Brandon Creighton) new proposal aims to decrease the power of faculty senates, requiring that half of their members be appointed by school presidents. All would be term-limited, advisory only and removable by top administrators for “political advocacy.”\n\n\nAnother provision would give the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board — composed of nine gubernatorial appointees — the ultimate say in faculty and academic screening. The board would pay special attention to schools’ required core curriculum, to ensure they “do not require or attempt to require a student to adopt a belief that any race, sex, or ethnicity or social, political, or religious belief is inherently superior.”\n\n\nComplaints lodged against professors would be investigated by a new state ombudsman and the attorney general, currently Ken Paxton (R), an ultraconservative Trump ally.\n\n\n“Texas is as broad-reaching a legislative endeavor as we’ve seen,” he (Professor Peter Lake, Stetson University) said. And combined with Trump’s attacks on higher education, the legislation is likely to “embolden red states to experiment with even more control over institutional autonomy, right down to curriculum, hiring and firing, tenure, curriculum review.”\n\n\nUT System Chancellor James B.

That could be devastating for low-income students and the institutions that serve them.\n\n\nHe [sample impacted student] credits his success at Bemidji to TRIO, a federally funded initiative dating back to the 1960s that supports low-income, first-generation college students and students with disabilities as they navigate academic life—and that currently faces an existential threat from the Trump administration.\n\n\n“Today, the pendulum has swung and access to college is not the obstacle it was for students of limited means,” officials wrote in the proposal [Trump budget opening salvo]. “A renewed focus on academics and scholastic accomplishment by [institutions], rather than engaging in woke ideology with federal taxpayer subsidies, would be a welcome change.”\n\n\n\n\nACE’s summary of “STUDENT SUCCESS AND TAXPAYER SAVINGS PLAN” that moves to the House Budget Committee (thanks CMR)\n\nhttps://www.acenet.edu/Documents/Summary-Student-Success-Taxpayer-Savings-Plan.pdf\n(Yes, the name shows the crazy stretching of the all-too elastic phrase “student success”)\nIt includes: Pell Grant restrictions; Loan program eliminations; New repayment plan; Risk-sharing requirement; Regulatory constraints.\nKey parts for Pell\n\nChanges full-time status from 24 semester hours or 36 quarter credit hours to 30 semester hours or 45 quarter credit hours;\n\n(From 12 to 15 credits for CUNY making full time much more out of reach for many of our students)\n\nRequiring that a student who applies for federal student aid be a citizen or a national of the United States or be an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act; and\n\n\nThese provisions would take effect on July 1, 2025, and apply to the 2025-2026 academic year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Trump’s Proposed Budget Cuts Mean for Education, Research (aims to cut at least $163 billion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/05/02/trump-proposes-deep-cuts-education-and-research\n(I’d argue even phrasing this as a planned cut, rather than merely an assault is a mistake, but….)\n\nThe proposed budget plan slashes nearly $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health, $12 billion from the Education Department and nearly $5 billion from the National Science Foundation. The skinny budget also eliminates funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, AmeriCorps, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has already made deep cuts at those agencies and put most—if not all—of their employees on leave.\n\n\nTo compensate for the cuts to programs that directly support students or institutions, the administration argued colleges, states and local communities should on take that responsibility. Other justifications for the cuts reflect the administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and higher ed.\n\n(Again, “crackdown” is far too fair a term here.)\n\nAdditionally, the administration wants to cut the Office for Civil Rights’ budget by $49 million, or 35 percent. The budget document says this cut will refocus OCR “away from DEI and Title IX transgender cases.” In recent years, the Biden administration pleaded with Congress to boost OCR’s funding in order to address an increasing number of complaints. The office received 22,687 complaints in fiscal year 2024, and the Biden administration projected that number to grow to nearly 24,000 in 2025.\n\n\n“The budget cuts funding for: climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and programs in low priority areas of science,” the officials wrote in budget documents. “NSF has fueled research with dubious public value, like speculative impacts from extreme climate scenarios and niche social studies.”\n\n(There is too much there to even unpack; I’ll just note that this was preceded by “we must change course and reorient taxpayer dollars toward proven programs that generate results for American students.”)\n\nThe plan would consolidate NIH programs into five areas: the National Institute on Body Systems Research, the National Institute on Neuroscience and Brain Research, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Institute of Disability Related Research, and the National Institute on Behavioral Health.\n\n\n“The administration is committed to restoring accountability, public trust, and transparency at the NIH,” officials wrote. “NIH has broken the trust of the American people with wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.”\n\n(More nonsense in this “skinny budget”)\n\n\n\n\nUnder Trump, National Science Foundation Cuts Off All Funding to Scientists | Scientific American\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01396-2\n(Only until further notice, as if law breakers mean what they write)\n\nThe policy prevents the NSF, one of the world’s biggest supporters of basic research, from awarding new research grants and from supplying allotted funds for existing grants, such as those that receive yearly increments of money.

The current directors and deputy directors will lose their titles and might be reassigned to other positions at the agency or elsewhere in the federal government.\n\n\nThe consolidation appears to be driven in part by President Donald Trump’s proposal to cut the agency’s $9 billion budget by 55% for the 2026 fiscal year that begins on 1 October.\n\n\nThe agency is also expected to issue another round of notices tomorrow terminating grants that have already been awarded, sources say.

More information on the appeals process can be found here. When appealing any grant termination, be sure to emphasize how this loss may impact not only your research but your reputation, opportunities passed up to take on the grant-funded project, and the loss of future opportunities that the grant might have made possible. Please remember that our colleagues at NEH – those who remain – are devastated by the current situation and are themselves overwhelmed.

Now, investigating discrimination in schools is practically “impossible.”\n\n\nIn South Dakota, the OCR abruptly terminated its work with a school district that had agreed to take steps to end discrimination against its Native American students. The same office that helped craft the agreement to treat indigenous students equally made a stunning about-face and decided in March that helping Native American students would discriminate against white students.\n\n\nOne OCR attorney, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, told ProPublica that their caseload went from 60 to 380 as they absorbed cases previously handled by employees who worked in offices that had been closed.\n\n\n“OCR is the most useless it’s ever been, and it’s the most dangerous it’s ever been. And by useless, I mean unavailable. Unable to do the work,”\n\n\nInvestigating cases that allege racism, discrimination based on sexual orientation or mistreatment of students with disabilities now requires permission from Trump appointees, according to a memo from OCR leadership. As a result, thousands of discrimination investigations are idled, even ones that were nearing a resolution when Trump took office again.\n\n\nInvestigations being publicized now have largely bypassed the agency’s civil rights attorneys, according to Education Department employees.

So too must be the student body, staff and leadership. A failing grade, the letter warned, would result in corrective measures, including the deliberate recruiting of “a critical mass” of new faculty and students to correct the imbalance.\n\n\nHarvard has rejected the Trump administration’s demands, calling them a threat to academic freedom and the political independence of higher education. But in a letter to Harvard affiliates informing them that the university was suing the government, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, echoed that vocabulary.\n\n\n“We acknowledge that we have unfinished business,” Dr. Garber wrote. “We need to ensure that the university lives up to its steps to reaffirm a culture of free inquiry, viewpoint diversity and academic exploration.”\n\n\nHarvard itself has been a hotbed of diverse views about the value of viewpoint diversity and its relationship to the bedrock value of academic freedom. But there’s broad agreement that the Trump administration is weaponizing the term — which its letter never defines — in a dangerous way.\n\n\nThe term viewpoint diversity began gaining currency across academia largely through the efforts of Heterodox Academy, a nonpartisan national group founded in 2015 to combat what it describes as “the rise of closed-minded orthodoxies within scholarly communities.”\n\n\nIn recent years, it has been picked up by Republican politicians, as a new tool to support their longstanding argument that universities have been taken over by the left.\n\n\nA report last October by the free expression group PEN America said that viewpoint diversity, while a laudable goal, has too often served as “camouflage” for the real purpose: stifling faculty members’ speech.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Disqualifies Harvard From Future Research Grants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/trump-harvard-research-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThe letter is as they say meshuga\nhttps://x.com/EDSecMcMahon/status/1919517481313427594\nMy favorite is to now blame it on the math\n\nWhy is it, we ask, that Harvard has to teach simple and basic mathematics, when it is supposedly so hard to get into this “acclaimed university”?

And in other circumstances, I would have been like, holy cow. But given what the administration has done over the past three and a half months, it’s not clear to me that it changes the administration’s posture.”\n\n\nTrump administration calls for a freeze on all new grants to Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/05/harvard-new-grants-freeze-trump/\n\nMcMahon’s letter displays an astonishing and frankly disqualifying level of ignorance — about Harvard, about how federal research funding works, and about the plain text of the U.S. Constitution,” Weld (AAUP President of Harvard chapter) said. “The entire higher ed sector must reject this crude authoritarianism with one voice.”\n\n\nTed Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, said, “I think we should all be looking at the interchange between the department, Harvard and the White House as harbingers of things to come.” \n\n\nLarry Summers, former president of Harvard, said the Trump administration’s fight with the Ivy League university has larger implications for civil society. “This is about whether the government has the power to coerce private institutions, using all the various authorities it has to advance particular political agendas of the president,” he said. “But for higher education, this is about academic freedom, which for the better part of a century, the Supreme Court recognized as intimately connected to the First Amendment. So in a broad civic sense, it’s about our commitment to constitutional democracy as manifest in the First Amendment.”\n\n\nTrump Finally Drops the Anti-Semitism Pretext – The latest letter to Harvard makes clear that the administration’s goal is to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal.

But the most notable thing about it is what it leaves out.\n\n\nTo hear McMahon tell it, Harvard is a university on the verge of ruin. (I say McMahon because her signature is at the bottom of the letter, but portions of the document are written in such a distinctive idiolect—“Why is there so much HATE?” the letter asks; it signs off with “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”—that one detects the spirit of a certain uncredited co-author.)\n\n\nWhat you will not find in the McMahon letter is any mention of the original justification for the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on elite universities: anti-Semitism.\n\n\nNow, however, the mask is off. Aside from one oblique reference to congressional hearings about anti-Semitism (“the great work of Congresswoman Elise Stefanik”), the letter is silent on the subject. The administration is no longer pretending that it is standing up for Jewish students. The project has been revealed for what it is: an effort to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal.\n\n\n“There’s no ‘We don’t like you’ authority in the federal Constitution or in statutory law.

For centuries, Harvard has cherished its independence, its swaggering pride and its record of academic excellence. But Mr. Trump has reveled in unleashing chaos that many believe will be difficult to contain as long as he sees the university as a target.\n\n\nThe corporation [the board that oversees the university] has told the school’s lawyers not to engage with the Trump administration, according to the two people involved in discussions.\n\n\nComplicating matters is whether the White House will honor a deal.\n\n\nLawrence H. Summers, a former Harvard president, said … “It would be a tragedy if Harvard resolved this in a way that gave support and encouragement to the idea of extralegal extortion.”\n\n\nThe Trump administration this week reiterated its aim to inflict as much damage as possible, when Ms. McMahon fired off a letter telling Harvard that it would not receive future federal grants. Although experts on government contracts and grants scoffed at the missive, the government can essentially blacklist contractors through a process called debarment.\n\n\nAside from the research funding, there will be nothing to stop the administration from saddling the school with more onerous and potentially costly investigations, like the ones currently being conducted by at least five different departments and agencies, including the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Orders to Investigate Columbia Protesters Raised Alarms in Justice Dept.

I did so because the letter represents an authoritarian threat to science, and I knew it wasn’t an isolated, bizarre incident. It is a warning sign, another move in a broader campaign to exert control over research, medicine and media.\n\n\nThe letter asserts that “publications like CHEST Journal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates.” It was written by recently appointed acting U.S. attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr., who gives no examples that might demonstrate partisanship; nor does he cite any laws or legal principles to indicate a matter that should concern the U.S. government.\n\n\nSince I publicly shared this, at least four additional journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, have confirmed receipt of similar letters, according to MedPage Today, STAT News, the New York Times and Science. Aside from Eric Rubin at the NEJM, none of the targeted editors have been willing to go on record, fearing retribution from the Trump administration.\n\n\nWhy CHEST? It’s a specialty outlet—not even among the top 50 medical journals. Is this a keyword-driven campaign like those we’ve seen at the CDC and NIH? Under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., terms like “diversity,” “minority” and “equity” have been systematically flagged.\n\n\nKennedy frequently makes evidence-free claims on podcasts and television shows and now in government press conferences, regardless of the consequences. However, peer-reviewed journals like CHEST require extensive scrutiny as part of their evaluation process.\n\n\nHow a Decades-Old Diversity Program Became Collateral Damage in Trump’s Anti-DEI Crusade\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-a-decades-old-diversity-program-became-collateral-damage-in-trumps-anti-dei-crusade\n\nThe PhD Project has for three decades encouraged business professionals from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue doctorates in the discipline. For years, its work was seen as uncontroversial; its annual conference introduced midcareer business professionals of color to the academy, offering resources and a support network to those interested in switching jobs. Eventually, some of those prospective students would become professors themselves, helping diversify a traditionally homogenous discipline.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Congress Grills College Presidents With an Old Script and New Threats\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/congress-hearing-college-presidents-haverford.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUnder Republicans’ Scrutiny, College Presidents Apologize for Their Handling of Campus Antisemitism\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/under-republicans-scrutiny-college-presidents-apologize-for-their-handling-of-campus-antisemitism\n\nA three-hour-long hearing on Wednesday once again gave House Republicans the opportunity to amplify reports of antisemitic social-media posts, events, and confrontations, and to demand that institutions provide information on how they discipline students and faculty members who transgress.\n\n\nBut lawmakers seeking to make a point had material to work with. The three campuses all saw pro-Palestinian protests and alleged incidents of antisemitic harassment following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.\n\n\nWednesday’s hearing marked yet another expansion of Republicans’ efforts to put higher ed under pressure. Since January, the Trump administration has canceled or frozen grants at several prominent research universities, largely for alleged failures to combat antisemitism.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: On California’s State Bar Exam, More Questions Than Answers\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/california-state-bar-exam.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThen came the news that at least a handful of the multiple-choice questions had been developed with the help of artificial intelligence. To many of those who took the exam, it was hardly shocking — they already had suspicions that A.I. had been used, based on a few questions that they said had struck them as bizarrely worded or legally unsound.\n\n\nKaplan, the new contractor for exam development, disputed that the study guide contained a significant number of errors.\n\n\nthe State Bar of California said in a statement. “We apologize again, and we make no excuses for the failures that have occurred.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior State Department official sought internal communications with journalists, European officials, and Trump critics | MIT Technology Review\n\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/01/1115988/senior-state-department-official-sought-internal-communications-with-journalists-european-officials-and-trump-critics/\n\nFried echoes this sentiment. “I spent 40 years in the State Department, and you didn’t collect names or demand email records,” says Fried. “I’ve never heard of such a thing”—at least not in the American context, he clarifies. It did remind him of Eastern European “Communist Party minder[s] watching over the untrusted bureaucracy.”\n\n\nHe adds: “It also approaches the compilation of an enemies list.”\n\n\nCal Poly, DePaul and Haverford Head to Capitol Hill\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/executive-leadership/2025/05/07/cal-poly-depaul-and-haverford-head-capitol-hill\n\nThis time, lawmakers are targeting California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo; DePaul University; and Haverford College. Presidents from all three institutions will testify at a congressional hearing today.\n\n\nIn all three letters, the Republican-led Committee on Education and the Workforce cited alleged instances of antisemitism and noted failing grades on the Anti-Defamation League’s Campus Antisemitism Report Card: Both DePaul and Haverford received an F, while Cal Poly earned a D.\n\n(Put aside a committee that conflates a D with failing and perhaps worry that Hunter has a “C” grade and could be up soon by these standards.)\n\nHigher Education Leaders Call for Greater Defense of Board Independence\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/07/higher-ed-leaders-call-defense-board-independence\n(Reports on this letter https://agb.org/news/letters-and-testimony/community-letter-reaffirming-the-independence-of-higher-education-governance-a-call-to-action/)\n\nAmerican higher education leaders, advocates and stakeholders must stand together to “defend the autonomy of college and university governing boards as a cornerstone of constitutional freedoms; and reject political interference that undermines academic excellence and fiduciary stewardship,” the group said.\n\n\nThey also called for leaders to reaffirm the principles of institutional autonomy laid out in the 1819 Supreme Court decision Dartmouth College v. Woodward, which established safeguards to protect colleges from ideological and political interference.\n\n\nThe chairs of the boards of trustees at Clark Atlanta University, Eastern Michigan University and the University of Illinois are among the signatories, as well as the heads of the Middle States and New England Commissions of Higher Education.\n\n\nLawmakers in several states have introduced legislation that seeks to increase board oversight in processes like academic programming and tenure, as well as a governor’s ability to appoint board members.\n\n\nA Looming Crisis for Public Colleges: If the federal government cuts Medicaid spending, state funding for higher ed will evaporate.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-looming-crisis-for-public-colleges\n\nThe House Republicans’ plan for reconciliation includes a cut of about $880 billion over the next decade in health-care and energy spending and $230 billion from agriculture. A budget reduction of this magnitude will require significant reductions to Medicaid and SNAP.\n\n\nThat would directly harm low- and moderate-income Americans across the country, but these costs will also be passed on to states, putting pressure on already-tight budgets. And, as history has shown us time and time again, a state-budget squeeze almost always leads to skyrocketing college costs and lower-quality public education.\n\n\nMost states are required to pass balanced budgets each year. But some programs, like Medicaid, are directly tied to formulas and federal matching dollars. When revenue is tight, especially in tough economic times, states reduce the portion of their total budgets that remain “discretionary” — the portion that is not dictated by formula-derived expenses.  In almost every state, higher education is the largest discretionary-spending category.\n\n\nFor just one example, look to Pennsylvania, where I [Tanya I. Garcia] previously served as deputy secretary and commissioner for postsecondary and higher education. For the 30-year period from financial year 1991 to financial year 2021, Pennsylvania increased Medicaid spending by 227 percent and decreased higher-education spending by 28 percent.\n\n\nWhen state funding for higher education drops, it affects open-access, less-selective colleges the most, since they are more dependent on state appropriations and less able to raise their prices than their peers at elite public and flagship institutions. This is a crucial distinction, as 86 percent of all undergraduate students pursuing a degree in the United States do not attend selective flagships or research universities.\n\n\nMake no mistake: Such massive federal funding cuts would unleash mayhem on state budgets and public colleges starved for resources. Almost 40 states will have finalized their budgets by June 30 of this year. Will we have a raft of states calling special legislative sessions to revise their budgets when all is said and done in the nation’s capital? We still have time to avoid this.\n\n\nNYTimes: I Know Trump’s Plan for Universities. It Transformed My College.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/opinion/trump-universities-woke.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMr. Trump has been watching what’s transpired in Florida. The architect of Project 2025’s education policies has said that Florida is “leading the way” on university overhauls. Already, Mr. Trump has threatened to pull funding from colleges that don’t purge language he considers woke. He’s demanded new oversight of certain regional studies departments. Next he could try to ban, as Florida has, “political or social activism.” He could weaken the protections provided by tenure and faculty unions. I saw this happen on my campus, and I know the toll it took. If the Trump administration has its way, my experience could offer a preview of what’s coming for other universities.\n\n\nSince Mr. DeSantis’s crackdown, I’ve seen my colleagues harassed and investigated for addressing topical issues, even outside the classroom. The climate of fear gives the government precisely the result it wants. Administrators and faculty members alike practice anticipatory obedience to avoid even the appearance of wokeness, stifling the sort of open and civil discussions that lead students to develop their own views.\n\n\nSeveral professors have been subjected to efforts at entrapment. Last year a man posing as a student tried to encourage Muslim faculty members to criticize Mr. DeSantis and Israel. A similar incident happened to me. … That incident shattered my conviction that if I did my job well and followed the rules, I would be safe.\n\n\nTeaching is, above all, the creation of a community in the classroom, a web of trust and curiosity that binds students and instructors in a shared intellectual project. Mistrust, fear and self-censorship make that project impossible.\n\n\nNYTimes: West Point Is Supposed to Educate, Not Indoctrinate\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/opinion/west-point-trump-military.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Very good summary of how academic freedom is taken away overnight)\n\n\n\n\nChronicle of Higher Education\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda\nAlso this one on the “dismantling” of DEI\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-higher-eds-dismantling-of-dei\n\nWe Are Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.wearehighered.org/\n(This was mentioned in the NY Times article on the Rutgers “alliance” resolution and allows people to contribute, https://www.wearehighered.org/contact)\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

So, you can say that, in terms of the loss of freedom, most people feel unaffected. But what we need to get our fellow citizens to see is that it’s all connected, and that when due process is undermined even for a noncitizen, ultimately it can put everyone’s freedom in jeopardy. What lessons do you draw from other countries such as Hungary, India, Poland, Brazil, the Philippines, Turkey and Venezuela, all of which have seen democratic backsliding over the past few decades?\n\n\n The lessons are that people should unify and coordinate as quickly as possible. The more that institutions under threat try to just go their own way or duck for cover, the more they’ll be divided and picked off one by one.

Schools that fail to comply could be barred from spending state funds.\n\n\nOpponents say the result would essentially be a takeover of the state’s 126 public universities, community college districts and medical schools, with state officials even allowed to overturn hiring decisions. They fear it could damage the institutions’ reputations and lead to a faculty brain drain.\n\n\nHis (Brandon Creighton) new proposal aims to decrease the power of faculty senates, requiring that half of their members be appointed by school presidents. All would be term-limited, advisory only and removable by top administrators for “political advocacy.”\n\n\nAnother provision would give the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board — composed of nine gubernatorial appointees — the ultimate say in faculty and academic screening. The board would pay special attention to schools’ required core curriculum, to ensure they “do not require or attempt to require a student to adopt a belief that any race, sex, or ethnicity or social, political, or religious belief is inherently superior.”\n\n\nComplaints lodged against professors would be investigated by a new state ombudsman and the attorney general, currently Ken Paxton (R), an ultraconservative Trump ally.\n\n\n“Texas is as broad-reaching a legislative endeavor as we’ve seen,” he (Professor Peter Lake, Stetson University) said. And combined with Trump’s attacks on higher education, the legislation is likely to “embolden red states to experiment with even more control over institutional autonomy, right down to curriculum, hiring and firing, tenure, curriculum review.”\n\n\nUT System Chancellor James B.

That could be devastating for low-income students and the institutions that serve them.\n\n\nHe [sample impacted student] credits his success at Bemidji to TRIO, a federally funded initiative dating back to the 1960s that supports low-income, first-generation college students and students with disabilities as they navigate academic life—and that currently faces an existential threat from the Trump administration.\n\n\n“Today, the pendulum has swung and access to college is not the obstacle it was for students of limited means,” officials wrote in the proposal [Trump budget opening salvo]. “A renewed focus on academics and scholastic accomplishment by [institutions], rather than engaging in woke ideology with federal taxpayer subsidies, would be a welcome change.”\n\n\n\n\nACE’s summary of “STUDENT SUCCESS AND TAXPAYER SAVINGS PLAN” that moves to the House Budget Committee (thanks CMR)\n\nhttps://www.acenet.edu/Documents/Summary-Student-Success-Taxpayer-Savings-Plan.pdf\n(Yes, the name shows the crazy stretching of the all-too elastic phrase “student success”)\nIt includes: Pell Grant restrictions; Loan program eliminations; New repayment plan; Risk-sharing requirement; Regulatory constraints.\nKey parts for Pell\n\nChanges full-time status from 24 semester hours or 36 quarter credit hours to 30 semester hours or 45 quarter credit hours;\n\n(From 12 to 15 credits for CUNY making full time much more out of reach for many of our students)\n\nRequiring that a student who applies for federal student aid be a citizen or a national of the United States or be an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act; and\n\n\nThese provisions would take effect on July 1, 2025, and apply to the 2025-2026 academic year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Trump’s Proposed Budget Cuts Mean for Education, Research (aims to cut at least $163 billion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/05/02/trump-proposes-deep-cuts-education-and-research\n(I’d argue even phrasing this as a planned cut, rather than merely an assault is a mistake, but….)\n\nThe proposed budget plan slashes nearly $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health, $12 billion from the Education Department and nearly $5 billion from the National Science Foundation. The skinny budget also eliminates funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, AmeriCorps, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has already made deep cuts at those agencies and put most—if not all—of their employees on leave.\n\n\nTo compensate for the cuts to programs that directly support students or institutions, the administration argued colleges, states and local communities should on take that responsibility. Other justifications for the cuts reflect the administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and higher ed.\n\n(Again, “crackdown” is far too fair a term here.)\n\nAdditionally, the administration wants to cut the Office for Civil Rights’ budget by $49 million, or 35 percent. The budget document says this cut will refocus OCR “away from DEI and Title IX transgender cases.” In recent years, the Biden administration pleaded with Congress to boost OCR’s funding in order to address an increasing number of complaints. The office received 22,687 complaints in fiscal year 2024, and the Biden administration projected that number to grow to nearly 24,000 in 2025.\n\n\n“The budget cuts funding for: climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and programs in low priority areas of science,” the officials wrote in budget documents. “NSF has fueled research with dubious public value, like speculative impacts from extreme climate scenarios and niche social studies.”\n\n(There is too much there to even unpack; I’ll just note that this was preceded by “we must change course and reorient taxpayer dollars toward proven programs that generate results for American students.”)\n\nThe plan would consolidate NIH programs into five areas: the National Institute on Body Systems Research, the National Institute on Neuroscience and Brain Research, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Institute of Disability Related Research, and the National Institute on Behavioral Health.\n\n\n“The administration is committed to restoring accountability, public trust, and transparency at the NIH,” officials wrote. “NIH has broken the trust of the American people with wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.”\n\n(More nonsense in this “skinny budget”)\n\n\n\n\nUnder Trump, National Science Foundation Cuts Off All Funding to Scientists | Scientific American\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01396-2\n(Only until further notice, as if law breakers mean what they write)\n\nThe policy prevents the NSF, one of the world’s biggest supporters of basic research, from awarding new research grants and from supplying allotted funds for existing grants, such as those that receive yearly increments of money. The email does not provide a reason for the freeze and says that it will last “until further notice”.\n\n\nTrump Halts Grants, Caps Indirect Costs at the National Science Foundation\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-halts-grants-caps-indirect-costs-at-the-national-science-foundation\n\nUniversities Sue NSF Over Indirect Research Cost Policy\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/07/universities-sue-nsf-over-indirect-research-cost-policy\n\nPlaintiffs in the lawsuit include the American Council on Education, the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and 13 universities, including Arizona State University, the University of Chicago and Princeton University.\n\n\nThey attest that the NSF violated numerous aspects of the Administrative Procedure Act, including bypassing Congress to unilaterally institute an “arbitrary and capricious” 15 percent rate cap and failing to explain why it’s only imposing the policy on universities.\n\n\nThe NSF awarded $6.7 billion to some 621 universities in 2023.\n\n\nExclusive: NSF faces radical shake-up as officials abolish its 37 divisions | Science | AAAS\n\nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/exclusive-nsf-faces-radical-shake-officials-abolish-its-37-divisions\n\n[The NSF] is plunging into deeper turmoil. According to sources who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, staff were told today that the agency’s 37 divisions—across all eight NSF directorates—are being abolished and the number of programs within those divisions will be drastically reduced. The current directors and deputy directors will lose their titles and might be reassigned to other positions at the agency or elsewhere in the federal government.\n\n\nThe consolidation appears to be driven in part by President Donald Trump’s proposal to cut the agency’s $9 billion budget by 55% for the 2026 fiscal year that begins on 1 October.\n\n\nThe agency is also expected to issue another round of notices tomorrow terminating grants that have already been awarded, sources say. In the past 3 weeks, the agency has pulled the plug on almost 1400 grants worth more than $1 billion.\n\n(CSI faculty were among these who lost funding this week.)\n\n\n\n\nLawsuit Against Humanities Endowment Offers Details on DOGE - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/arts/humanities-endowment-doge-grants.html\n\nEmployees from the Department of Government Efficiency started visiting the office soon after, according to the lawsuit. Citing accounts by former or current staff members at the endowment, the lawsuit says that two DOGE employees, Nate Cavanaugh and Justin Fox, asked for a list of all current grants and then “indiscriminately terminated the vast majority” on April 2. Nearly 1,500 grant recipients received cancellation letters that suggested their projects were not in keeping with “the president’s agenda.”\n\n\nThree weeks later, the agency announced it would be redirecting [stealing ed.] $17 million of its funding to create the National Garden of American Heroes,\n\n\nThe lawsuit contends that those moves violate the Constitution, which reserves the power of the purse for Congress, and also the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\nTrump proposes eliminating the NEA and NEH as arts grants are canceled\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/05/03/trump-budget-nea-neh-eliminate/\n(This applies going forward, the lawsuit applies to past allocations. But the keyword is “proposed”, as this was just part of the Trumpian fantasy budget.)\n\nNYTimes: The National Endowment for the Arts Begins Terminating Grants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/03/arts/national-endowment-for-the-arts-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nGuidance from MAA (https://www.medievalacademy.org/; thanks EST for sharing)\n\n(This appeared in a news letter, so no link is available)\n\nWith the caveat that the MAA cannot offer actual legal advice, here is the current state of affairs, as we understand it:\n\n\n\nACLS, AHA, and MLA have filed a lawsuit against the NEH and DOGE. The complaint is online here. The suit is likely to proceed quickly, and we will keep you apprised of its progress.\n\n\n\n\nA court decision handed down earlier this week compels the government to restore terminated IMLS funding. I am hopeful that this success will serve as a strong precedent for other suits.\n\n\n\n\nThose who have lost NEH funding should have filed an appeal by now, either as an individual or through their host institution. If you have not done so, the guidance we’ve received is that you should file anyway before taking any further action, following whatever guidelines you have received (and with the understanding that there is, in fact, no truly clear guidance about what is happening at NEH). More information on the appeals process can be found here. When appealing any grant termination, be sure to emphasize how this loss may impact not only your research but your reputation, opportunities passed up to take on the grant-funded project, and the loss of future opportunities that the grant might have made possible. Please remember that our colleagues at NEH – those who remain – are devastated by the current situation and are themselves overwhelmed. They are committed Federal employees who are not to blame for these terminations. I urge you to try to be patient as your appeal (and the lawsuit) move forward.",

Now, investigating discrimination in schools is practically “impossible.”\n\n\nIn South Dakota, the OCR abruptly terminated its work with a school district that had agreed to take steps to end discrimination against its Native American students. The same office that helped craft the agreement to treat indigenous students equally made a stunning about-face and decided in March that helping Native American students would discriminate against white students.\n\n\nOne OCR attorney, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, told ProPublica that their caseload went from 60 to 380 as they absorbed cases previously handled by employees who worked in offices that had been closed.\n\n\n“OCR is the most useless it’s ever been, and it’s the most dangerous it’s ever been. And by useless, I mean unavailable. Unable to do the work,”\n\n\nInvestigating cases that allege racism, discrimination based on sexual orientation or mistreatment of students with disabilities now requires permission from Trump appointees, according to a memo from OCR leadership. As a result, thousands of discrimination investigations are idled, even ones that were nearing a resolution when Trump took office again.\n\n\nInvestigations being publicized now have largely bypassed the agency’s civil rights attorneys, according to Education Department employees. McMahon and OCR head Craig Trainor created what amounts to a shadow division.\n\n(This article is really a gut punch, but well worth reading)\n\nEducation Dept.

This year, prior to the cancellation, more than 400 applications had been submitted.",

So too must be the student body, staff and leadership. A failing grade, the letter warned, would result in corrective measures, including the deliberate recruiting of “a critical mass” of new faculty and students to correct the imbalance.\n\n\nHarvard has rejected the Trump administration’s demands, calling them a threat to academic freedom and the political independence of higher education. But in a letter to Harvard affiliates informing them that the university was suing the government, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, echoed that vocabulary.\n\n\n“We acknowledge that we have unfinished business,” Dr. Garber wrote. “We need to ensure that the university lives up to its steps to reaffirm a culture of free inquiry, viewpoint diversity and academic exploration.”\n\n\nHarvard itself has been a hotbed of diverse views about the value of viewpoint diversity and its relationship to the bedrock value of academic freedom. But there’s broad agreement that the Trump administration is weaponizing the term — which its letter never defines — in a dangerous way.\n\n\nThe term viewpoint diversity began gaining currency across academia largely through the efforts of Heterodox Academy, a nonpartisan national group founded in 2015 to combat what it describes as “the rise of closed-minded orthodoxies within scholarly communities.”\n\n\nIn recent years, it has been picked up by Republican politicians, as a new tool to support their longstanding argument that universities have been taken over by the left.\n\n\nA report last October by the free expression group PEN America said that viewpoint diversity, while a laudable goal, has too often served as “camouflage” for the real purpose: stifling faculty members’ speech.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Disqualifies Harvard From Future Research Grants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/trump-harvard-research-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThe letter is as they say meshuga\nhttps://x.com/EDSecMcMahon/status/1919517481313427594\nMy favorite is to now blame it on the math\n\nWhy is it, we ask, that Harvard has to teach simple and basic mathematics, when it is supposedly so hard to get into this “acclaimed university”? Who is getting in under such a low standard when others, with fabulous grades and a great understanding of the highest levels of mathematics, are being rejected?\n\nWhen the NY Times calls this “a contentious letter” they are only sane washing it. It might better be described by an AI prompt “write crazy letter on Harvard in the voice of the president, include all specious claims”\n\nDeciphering the Trump Administration’s Latest Letter to Harvard\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/05/07/experts-unpack-linda-mcmahons-latest-letter-harvard\nInsidehighered found one Project 2025 voice here:\n\n“When the secretary says, ‘Don’t come to us for grants anymore,’ she means that, and she can enforce it,” said Adam Kissel, a visiting fellow in the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Education Policy. “The tone suggests that Harvard really needs to wake up and understand the dire nature of its situation.”\n\nBut by and large, this is the take they find\n\nBut Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, described Monday’s letter as a “particularly disturbing” and “unwarranted escalation of threats.” What the Trump administration has done since day one, Pasquerella said, is launch a “politically motivated attack, not only against Harvard, but higher education as a whole,” and it’s all part of a long-standing Republican playbook.\n\n\nMultiple Inside Higher Ed sources have described the Trump administration’s approach to higher education as “fascist” or “authoritarian,” and Pasquerella even noted that the White House has positioned Viktor Orbán—Hungary’s right-wing prime minister who has long been known for his assault on academic freedom—as someone to emulate.\n\n\n“The president is so bombastic and so over-the-top that it’s hard for me to see gradations,” Hess [director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank] said. “So, sure, the secretary sending a letter that declared ‘don’t bother applying for anything’ is an extraordinary declaration. And in other circumstances, I would have been like, holy cow. But given what the administration has done over the past three and a half months, it’s not clear to me that it changes the administration’s posture.”\n\n\nTrump administration calls for a freeze on all new grants to Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/05/harvard-new-grants-freeze-trump/\n\nMcMahon’s letter displays an astonishing and frankly disqualifying level of ignorance — about Harvard, about how federal research funding works, and about the plain text of the U.S. Constitution,” Weld (AAUP President of Harvard chapter) said. “The entire higher ed sector must reject this crude authoritarianism with one voice.”\n\n\nTed Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, said, “I think we should all be looking at the interchange between the department, Harvard and the White House as harbingers of things to come.” \n\n\nLarry Summers, former president of Harvard, said the Trump administration’s fight with the Ivy League university has larger implications for civil society. “This is about whether the government has the power to coerce private institutions, using all the various authorities it has to advance particular political agendas of the president,” he said. “But for higher education, this is about academic freedom, which for the better part of a century, the Supreme Court recognized as intimately connected to the First Amendment. So in a broad civic sense, it’s about our commitment to constitutional democracy as manifest in the First Amendment.”\n\n\nTrump Finally Drops the Anti-Semitism Pretext – The latest letter to Harvard makes clear that the administration’s goal is to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal. (Thanks BE for the sharing and the gift link!)\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/mcmahon-harvard-letter/682717/?gift=yCYg0MdUGpnvquf3En3lpkKQKFBhGvbst4TkhNQ1SSk&utm_source=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=social\n(A critique that doesn’t sanewash and well worth reading)\n\nThe intensely hostile letter that Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent to the leadership of Harvard yesterday has a lot going on. But the most notable thing about it is what it leaves out.\n\n\nTo hear McMahon tell it, Harvard is a university on the verge of ruin. (I say McMahon because her signature is at the bottom of the letter, but portions of the document are written in such a distinctive idiolect—“Why is there so much HATE?” the letter asks; it signs off with “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”—that one detects the spirit of a certain uncredited co-author.)\n\n\nWhat you will not find in the McMahon letter is any mention of the original justification for the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on elite universities: anti-Semitism.\n\n\nNow, however, the mask is off. Aside from one oblique reference to congressional hearings about anti-Semitism (“the great work of Congresswoman Elise Stefanik”), the letter is silent on the subject. The administration is no longer pretending that it is standing up for Jewish students. The project has been revealed for what it is: an effort to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal.\n\n\n“There’s no ‘We don’t like you’ authority in the federal Constitution or in statutory law. In fact, quite the opposite: You’re precluded from that.” [Derek Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina]\n\n\nHarvard Faculty Pledge 10% of Their Salary to Defend Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/06/harvard-faculty-pledge-10-salary-defend-against-trump\n\nNearly 100 senior faculty members at Harvard have committed to taking a pay cut to support the institution’s legal defense against the federal government.\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Leaders See Only Bad Outcomes Ahead as They Battle Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/harvard-trump-court-case-negotiation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut behind the scenes, several senior officials at Harvard and on its top governing board believe that the university is confronting a crisis that could last until President Trump is out of power, according to three people involved in the discussions. Even if Harvard’s legal case is successful, these officials say, the school will still face enormous troubles that may force the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university to rethink its identity and scale.\n\nSo says\n\nThey spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss school officials’ private deliberations.\n\n\nThe crosscurrents are unlike any that the university has faced in its modern history. For centuries, Harvard has cherished its independence, its swaggering pride and its record of academic excellence. But Mr. Trump has reveled in unleashing chaos that many believe will be difficult to contain as long as he sees the university as a target.\n\n\nThe corporation [the board that oversees the university] has told the school’s lawyers not to engage with the Trump administration, according to the two people involved in discussions.\n\n\nComplicating matters is whether the White House will honor a deal.\n\n\nLawrence H. Summers, a former Harvard president, said … “It would be a tragedy if Harvard resolved this in a way that gave support and encouragement to the idea of extralegal extortion.”\n\n\nThe Trump administration this week reiterated its aim to inflict as much damage as possible, when Ms. McMahon fired off a letter telling Harvard that it would not receive future federal grants. Although experts on government contracts and grants scoffed at the missive, the government can essentially blacklist contractors through a process called debarment.\n\n\nAside from the research funding, there will be nothing to stop the administration from saddling the school with more onerous and potentially costly investigations, like the ones currently being conducted by at least five different departments and agencies, including the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Orders to Investigate Columbia Protesters Raised Alarms in Justice Dept.

    "text": "The Scary Implications of U.S. Government Attacks on Medical Journals | Scientific American\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-scary-implications-of-u-s-government-attacks-on-medical-journals/\n\nIn April, I decided to make public a leaked letter from the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to the editor-in-chief of CHEST, a leading pulmonology and critical care journal. I did so because the letter represents an authoritarian threat to science, and I knew it wasn’t an isolated, bizarre incident. It is a warning sign, another move in a broader campaign to exert control over research, medicine and media.\n\n\nThe letter asserts that “publications like CHEST Journal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates.” It was written by recently appointed acting U.S. attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr., who gives no examples that might demonstrate partisanship; nor does he cite any laws or legal principles to indicate a matter that should concern the U.S. government.\n\n\nSince I publicly shared this, at least four additional journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, have confirmed receipt of similar letters, according to MedPage Today, STAT News, the New York Times and Science. Aside from Eric Rubin at the NEJM, none of the targeted editors have been willing to go on record, fearing retribution from the Trump administration.\n\n\nWhy CHEST? It’s a specialty outlet—not even among the top 50 medical journals. Is this a keyword-driven campaign like those we’ve seen at the CDC and NIH? Under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., terms like “diversity,” “minority” and “equity” have been systematically flagged.\n\n\nKennedy frequently makes evidence-free claims on podcasts and television shows and now in government press conferences, regardless of the consequences. However, peer-reviewed journals like CHEST require extensive scrutiny as part of their evaluation process.\n\n\nHow a Decades-Old Diversity Program Became Collateral Damage in Trump’s Anti-DEI Crusade\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-a-decades-old-diversity-program-became-collateral-damage-in-trumps-anti-dei-crusade\n\nThe PhD Project has for three decades encouraged business professionals from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue doctorates in the discipline. For years, its work was seen as uncontroversial; its annual conference introduced midcareer business professionals of color to the academy, offering resources and a support network to those interested in switching jobs. Eventually, some of those prospective students would become professors themselves, helping diversify a traditionally homogenous discipline.",

The three campuses all saw pro-Palestinian protests and alleged incidents of antisemitic harassment following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.\n\n\nWednesday’s hearing marked yet another expansion of Republicans’ efforts to put higher ed under pressure. Since January, the Trump administration has canceled or frozen grants at several prominent research universities, largely for alleged failures to combat antisemitism.",

It did remind him of Eastern European “Communist Party minder[s] watching over the untrusted bureaucracy.”\n\n\nHe adds: “It also approaches the compilation of an enemies list.”\n\n\nCal Poly, DePaul and Haverford Head to Capitol Hill\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/executive-leadership/2025/05/07/cal-poly-depaul-and-haverford-head-capitol-hill\n\nThis time, lawmakers are targeting California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo; DePaul University; and Haverford College. Presidents from all three institutions will testify at a congressional hearing today.\n\n\nIn all three letters, the Republican-led Committee on Education and the Workforce cited alleged instances of antisemitism and noted failing grades on the Anti-Defamation League’s Campus Antisemitism Report Card: Both DePaul and Haverford received an F, while Cal Poly earned a D.\n\n(Put aside a committee that conflates a D with failing and perhaps worry that Hunter has a “C” grade and could be up soon by these standards.)\n\nHigher Education Leaders Call for Greater Defense of Board Independence\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/07/higher-ed-leaders-call-defense-board-independence\n(Reports on this letter https://agb.org/news/letters-and-testimony/community-letter-reaffirming-the-independence-of-higher-education-governance-a-call-to-action/)\n\nAmerican higher education leaders, advocates and stakeholders must stand together to “defend the autonomy of college and university governing boards as a cornerstone of constitutional freedoms; and reject political interference that undermines academic excellence and fiduciary stewardship,” the group said.\n\n\nThey also called for leaders to reaffirm the principles of institutional autonomy laid out in the 1819 Supreme Court decision Dartmouth College v. Woodward, which established safeguards to protect colleges from ideological and political interference.\n\n\nThe chairs of the boards of trustees at Clark Atlanta University, Eastern Michigan University and the University of Illinois are among the signatories, as well as the heads of the Middle States and New England Commissions of Higher Education.\n\n\nLawmakers in several states have introduced legislation that seeks to increase board oversight in processes like academic programming and tenure, as well as a governor’s ability to appoint board members.\n\n\nA Looming Crisis for Public Colleges: If the federal government cuts Medicaid spending, state funding for higher ed will evaporate.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-looming-crisis-for-public-colleges\n\nThe House Republicans’ plan for reconciliation includes a cut of about $880 billion over the next decade in health-care and energy spending and $230 billion from agriculture. A budget reduction of this magnitude will require significant reductions to Medicaid and SNAP.\n\n\nThat would directly harm low- and moderate-income Americans across the country, but these costs will also be passed on to states, putting pressure on already-tight budgets. And, as history has shown us time and time again, a state-budget squeeze almost always leads to skyrocketing college costs and lower-quality public education.\n\n\nMost states are required to pass balanced budgets each year. But some programs, like Medicaid, are directly tied to formulas and federal matching dollars. When revenue is tight, especially in tough economic times, states reduce the portion of their total budgets that remain “discretionary” — the portion that is not dictated by formula-derived expenses.  In almost every state, higher education is the largest discretionary-spending category.\n\n\nFor just one example, look to Pennsylvania, where I [Tanya I. Garcia] previously served as deputy secretary and commissioner for postsecondary and higher education. For the 30-year period from financial year 1991 to financial year 2021, Pennsylvania increased Medicaid spending by 227 percent and decreased higher-education spending by 28 percent.\n\n\nWhen state funding for higher education drops, it affects open-access, less-selective colleges the most, since they are more dependent on state appropriations and less able to raise their prices than their peers at elite public and flagship institutions. This is a crucial distinction, as 86 percent of all undergraduate students pursuing a degree in the United States do not attend selective flagships or research universities.\n\n\nMake no mistake: Such massive federal funding cuts would unleash mayhem on state budgets and public colleges starved for resources. Almost 40 states will have finalized their budgets by June 30 of this year. Will we have a raft of states calling special legislative sessions to revise their budgets when all is said and done in the nation’s capital? We still have time to avoid this.\n\n\nNYTimes: I Know Trump’s Plan for Universities. It Transformed My College.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/opinion/trump-universities-woke.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMr. Trump has been watching what’s transpired in Florida. The architect of Project 2025’s education policies has said that Florida is “leading the way” on university overhauls. Already, Mr. Trump has threatened to pull funding from colleges that don’t purge language he considers woke. He’s demanded new oversight of certain regional studies departments. Next he could try to ban, as Florida has, “political or social activism.” He could weaken the protections provided by tenure and faculty unions. I saw this happen on my campus, and I know the toll it took. If the Trump administration has its way, my experience could offer a preview of what’s coming for other universities.\n\n\nSince Mr. DeSantis’s crackdown, I’ve seen my colleagues harassed and investigated for addressing topical issues, even outside the classroom. The climate of fear gives the government precisely the result it wants. Administrators and faculty members alike practice anticipatory obedience to avoid even the appearance of wokeness, stifling the sort of open and civil discussions that lead students to develop their own views.\n\n\nSeveral professors have been subjected to efforts at entrapment. Last year a man posing as a student tried to encourage Muslim faculty members to criticize Mr. DeSantis and Israel. A similar incident happened to me. … That incident shattered my conviction that if I did my job well and followed the rules, I would be safe.\n\n\nTeaching is, above all, the creation of a community in the classroom, a web of trust and curiosity that binds students and instructors in a shared intellectual project. Mistrust, fear and self-censorship make that project impossible.\n\n\nNYTimes: West Point Is Supposed to Educate, Not Indoctrinate\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/opinion/west-point-trump-military.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Very good summary of how academic freedom is taken away overnight)",

In the rare areas where the president — or perhaps Elon Musk — may see value in research, the emergent mafia state is almost certain to distribute funds to its friends. One shudders to think what universities would have to do to fit themselves into that category.\n\n\nSo this is my radical proposal for universities: Act like universities, not like businesses.

It is primarily about the acquisition of power — power for its own sake. It is a multifront assault to make the earth a playground for ruthless men, so of course any institutions that might restrain power must be weakened or destroyed. Trumpism is about ego, appetite and acquisitiveness and is driven by a primal aversion to the higher elements of the human spirit — learning, compassion, scientific wonder, the pursuit of justice.\n\n\nThese are not separate battles. This is a single effort to undo the parts of the civilizational order that might restrain Trump’s acquisition of power. And it will take a concerted response to beat it back.\n\n\nSlowly, many of us are realizing that we need to band together. But even these efforts are insular and fragmented.\n\n\nLet’s take the universities. I’ve been privileged to teach at American universities off and on for nearly 30 years and I get to visit a dozen or two others every year. These are the crown jewels of American life. They are hubs of scientific and entrepreneurial innovation.

This is what the Administration is doing by demanding Harvard accede to “viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\nThe Administration is also overstepping its authority by imposing sweeping conditions on funds that weren’t spelled out by Congress. The Justices held in Cummings (2022) that “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously” to ensure the recipient “voluntarily and knowingly accept[ed] the terms.”\n\n\nWhat Harvard Has Set the Stage For\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/harvard-university-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Thanks EI)\n\nWith these words, Harvard became the first university to officially resist the administration’s abusive intimidation, and it is urgent that it not be the only one. Its actions, supported in recent weeks in statements by other academic leaders, including the presidents of Princeton and Wesleyan, light the way forward on a vital path to fighting President Trump’s war on the independence of higher education.\n\n\nIf universities accept Mr. Trump’s terms, on the other hand, the consequence would be far greater, undermining the very purpose of an independent institution.\n\n\nHarvard Had No Choice\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/harvard-had-no-choice\n\nThus, its decision deserves either praise for courage or condemnation for foolhardiness. I choose praise — in no small part because, as we have already seen with Columbia, capitulation to President Trump’s demands brings only more demands. There’s no point in selling your soul if all you receive in exchange is a worthless IOU.\n\n\nThe anti-intellectual ideologues (no, that’s not an oxymoron) running education policy within and adjacent to the White House do not wish to reform higher education; they want to break it.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: If You’re Boycotting Columbia, Your Priorities Are All Wrong\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/columbia-university-boycott-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThen came the circular firing squad. By mid-April, 2,000 people and more than 75 organizations, most of them faculty groups, had signed onto a boycott of our events, and said they would refuse to work with Columbia scholars, like myself, a vice dean, who hold administrative positions.\n\n\nOne of the main organizers of the boycott, the City University of New York anthropologist Gary Wilder, has struggled to explain this strange form of solidarity.\n\nBut\n\nColumbia would not allow any government to deny professors their rightful role in personnel decisions or to dictate the content of our curricula. Nor would we collaborate with government agents intent on deporting our students and faculty members simply because they exercised their First Amendment rights. At no point did our leadership concede any of these essential principles, which is surely why Columbia has been under Department of Justice investigation “for harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus.”\n\n\nNow that Harvard University has decided to defy the Trump administration, the stage is set for an epic struggle, one that has already defied the expectations of cynics on both sides. After being presented with new demands, Columbia is refusing to comply. No thanks to our fair-weather friends, our acting president, Claire Shipman, has vowed to reject any agreement in which “the government dictates what we teach, research or who we hire” as well as one that would “require us to relinquish our independence and autonomy as an educational institution.” Columbia alumni are rallying in support.\n\n\nThe greatness of American universities is at risk because anti-intellectuals are undermining the foundation of academic excellence: the ability of teachers and researchers to work without political micromanagement in the pursuit of truth, even when these truths are unpopular. Colleges and universities should join a mutual defense pact, as faculty members at several universities, including Rutgers and Indiana University have proposed. If we speak with one voice, we can better articulate the essential importance of universities to the American way of life.\n\n\nWe have now seen that the Trump administration manages the economy with the same expertise and competence it manages higher education, and as a result we might begin to rally the American people. If, instead, academics choose to boycott colleagues rather than stand with them, they become accomplices in the very assault on academic freedom they wish to oppose.\n\n\n\n\n\nCornell Sues DOE for ‘Unlawful’ Cuts to Indirect Costs for Research Grants - The Cornell Daily Sun\n\nhttps://www.cornellsun.com/article/2025/04/breaking-cornell-sues-doe-following-1-billion-funding-freeze\n\nACE and others file lawsuite to prevent DOE cuts\n\nhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.283318/gov.uscourts.mad.283318.1.0.pdf\n\n\n\n\nBrown Takes Out $300 Million Loan\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/17/brown-takes-out-300-million-loan\n\nBoth Harvard University and Princeton University announced in recent weeks that they were issuing bonds.

It is a multifront assault to make the earth a playground for ruthless men, so of course any institutions that might restrain power must be weakened or destroyed. Trumpism is about ego, appetite and acquisitiveness and is driven by a primal aversion to the higher elements of the human spirit — learning, compassion, scientific wonder, the pursuit of justice.\n\n\nThese are not separate battles. This is a single effort to undo the parts of the civilizational order that might restrain Trump’s acquisition of power.

By mid-April, 2,000 people and more than 75 organizations, most of them faculty groups, had signed onto a boycott of our events, and said they would refuse to work with Columbia scholars, like myself, a vice dean, who hold administrative positions.\n\n\nOne of the main organizers of the boycott, the City University of New York anthropologist Gary Wilder, has struggled to explain this strange form of solidarity.\n\nBut\n\nColumbia would not allow any government to deny professors their rightful role in personnel decisions or to dictate the content of our curricula. Nor would we collaborate with government agents intent on deporting our students and faculty members simply because they exercised their First Amendment rights. At no point did our leadership concede any of these essential principles, which is surely why Columbia has been under Department of Justice investigation “for harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus.”\n\n\nNow that Harvard University has decided to defy the Trump administration, the stage is set for an epic struggle, one that has already defied the expectations of cynics on both sides. After being presented with new demands, Columbia is refusing to comply. No thanks to our fair-weather friends, our acting president, Claire Shipman, has vowed to reject any agreement in which “the government dictates what we teach, research or who we hire” as well as one that would “require us to relinquish our independence and autonomy as an educational institution.” Columbia alumni are rallying in support.\n\n\nThe greatness of American universities is at risk because anti-intellectuals are undermining the foundation of academic excellence: the ability of teachers and researchers to work without political micromanagement in the pursuit of truth, even when these truths are unpopular. Colleges and universities should join a mutual defense pact, as faculty members at several universities, including Rutgers and Indiana University have proposed. If we speak with one voice, we can better articulate the essential importance of universities to the American way of life.\n\n\nWe have now seen that the Trump administration manages the economy with the same expertise and competence it manages higher education, and as a result we might begin to rally the American people. If, instead, academics choose to boycott colleagues rather than stand with them, they become accomplices in the very assault on academic freedom they wish to oppose.\n\n\n\n\n\nCornell Sues DOE for ‘Unlawful’ Cuts to Indirect Costs for Research Grants - The Cornell Daily Sun\n\nhttps://www.cornellsun.com/article/2025/04/breaking-cornell-sues-doe-following-1-billion-funding-freeze\n\nACE and others file lawsuite to prevent DOE cuts\n\nhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.283318/gov.uscourts.mad.283318.1.0.pdf\n\n\n\n\nBrown Takes Out $300 Million Loan\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/17/brown-takes-out-300-million-loan\n\nBoth Harvard University and Princeton University announced in recent weeks that they were issuing bonds.

There is no other logical explanation.\n\n(Well, the argument of destroying competing power bases is another explanation. If a sharpie can be used to rewrite truth without pesky pushback…)\n\nThe EU is licking its chops over this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. According to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, while on stage at Sorbonne University, the EU Executive Branch has already decided to set up a “super grant” program, aimed at “longer-term perspective to the very best in the field.”\n\n\nthe Commission is authorizing additional funding of $566 million in 2025-2027, making Europe “a magnet for researchers.” This funding is in addition to the European Research Council’s budget of $18 billion for 2021-2027. Moreover, the EU will “enshrine freedom of scientific research into law” via a new enactment. Europe will not compromise on its long-standing principles of academic freedom.\n\n\n“The administration has issued a multi-pronged, anti-science attack on the health sciences.

It informed the organizers of a Danish lecture series — one I was soon scheduled to speak at — that the final portion of American funding would be released only after they signed a statement essentially saying they were in compliance with a U.S. executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n\nBefore the organizers at the University of Southern Denmark could respond, the U.S. State Department sent an even blunter message: The grant was “being terminated for the convenience of the U.S. government.” It concluded by thanking the Danes “for your partnering with the Department of State and God Bless America.”\n\n\nSecond, the cutoff of funding was followed nearly two weeks later by another message to the university. (I viewed copies of all the emails.) It said that a recent court hearing prevented the State Department from holding up congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds and ordered it to make the financing available. It further ordered the department to “provide written notice of this order” to recipients of grants. Notifying the Danish university was as far as the administration went in complying with the court. The remaining funds haven’t been released yet, organizers say — typical of the Trump administration’s defiance of the courts.\n\n\nAnother core element of freedom — indeed something essential to its survival — is that power must be limited; there have to be checks and balances not just within government but within society. I have long warned that the concentration of wealth among a small percentage of the population would provide a fertile field for a demagogue, and that there was an ample supply of people who might play the part.\n\n\nUniversities, which protect academic freedom, are as important to this system of checks and balances as other civil rights protections like freedom of the press.\n\n\nNYU Withholds Diploma Due to Pro-Palestinian Commencement Speech\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/16/nyu-withholds-diploma-due-pro-palestinian-grad-speech\n\nRozos spoke at the ceremony for the university’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study.

Yale’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is also investing $4 million to support graduate students who have lost training and research grants. Similarly, last month Johns Hopkins University announced that it is tapping earnings from its $13.2 billion endowment to give researchers $100,000 each for delayed grants, or $150,000 for terminated grants, during a 12-month period. And Northwestern University—which hasn’t received any grant payments from the National Institutes of Health since March—is offering faculty up to $50,000 to maintain projects for up to one year.\n\n(Hopefully CUNY will be providing some relief in this manner as well)\n\nOver the past several decades, universities have already substantially increased the amount of money they spend on their own research and development—from 10 percent of the total in 1970 to 25 percent in 2023, according to federal data. Meanwhile, federal support for academic research has been on the decline, falling from 71 percent to 55 percent during that same timeframe. And support from industry, charities and other sources have always been marginal, collectively making up about 15 percent of contributions to research funding at colleges and universities in 2023.\n\n\nWhile that won’t cover all of the terminated grants, “the bridge has to go somewhere,” he said, explaining that the program isn’t supporting projects that don’t have viable alternative long-term funding options. Instead, “we’re providing funding for projects where the faculty member has other sources of funding and other proposals with the same or different federal agencies,” Díaz de la Rubia said.

In Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, published as short stories in the late 1940s and as a novel in 1953, warned not only of the destruction of books, but of a society in which people had lost the desire to read them. The parallel today is not only the administration’s effort to destroy and suppress knowledge, but also the institution’s willingness to accept the cultivated irrelevance of it—a challenge that undermines any serious effort to conduct research, inform policy, or guide public institutions.\n\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF)—established as an independent agency through the National Science Act of 1950 and marking its 75th anniversary this week—traces its roots to Vannevar Bush’s landmark report, “Science, the Endless Frontier,” addressed to President Harry S. Truman. But we might also see the establishment of this premier research institution as reflecting a response to fears depicted by Bradbury. The NSF can be understood not only as a catalyst of scientific promise for national purpose, but also as a guarded response to fears about centralized control over knowledge and thought, shaped by the dark shadows of the Third Reich and the emerging Red Scare.\n\n\nLast week, as the Board held its 494th meeting, I listened to NSF staff say that DOGE had by fiat the authority to give thumbs up or down to grant applications which had been systematically vetted by layers of subject matter experts.\n\n\nOur closed-to-the-public deliberations were observed by Zachary Terrell from the DOGE team. Through his Zoom screen, Terrell showed more interest in his water bottle and his cuticles than in the discussion. According to Nature Terrell, listed as a “consultant” in the NSF directory, had accessed the NSF awards system to block the dispersal of approved grants. The message I received was that the National Science Board had a role to play in name only.\n\n\nAll of this is threatened by the creeping normalization of authoritarian approaches to knowledge management and academic freedom. The National Science Board has not been disbanded like so many other statutorily established, independent agencies in the federal government. But preservation of form provides little consolation when function has been strategically neutralized, mirroring the backsliding that scholars have thoroughly documented: maintaining legitimacy for institutions that no longer honor their founding purposes. This hollowing out is not just about governance in the abstract, it has material consequences for which research questions get asked, which datasets get produced, which knowledge gets produced, and which perspectives shape our understanding of pressing societal challenges. It has consequences for the integrity of knowledge itself.\n\n\nLast week, the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, was summarily dismissed via an email addressed to “Carla” from a White House HR administrator. The Trump Administration claimed that she was fired for “things she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.” It is true that Hayden was repeatedly on record as saying the Library should be for all Americans. And it is false that the Library, which is intended to hold all books published in the United States, lends books to children. The ouster of Hayden is part of a broader pattern of political targeting of women and Black public servants across the federal government.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Cancels Scores of Grants to Study Online Misinformation\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/trump-online-misinformation-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast month, the National Science Foundation, a government agency that finances much of the scientific research in the United States, began canceling hundreds of grants. Most focused on studies involving issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, but scores singled out work on online content.\n\n\nThe cancellation has jeopardized research in universities in virtually every state, leaving researchers scrambling to find funding for projects that in many cases are only partly completed.\n\n\nEach Friday since then, the foundation has announced new cancellations. It has now cut more than 1,400 grants, including 75 more last Friday. In all, the grants were worth more than $1 billion, according to a list compiled by two researchers, Scott W. Delaney, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health, and Noam Ross, the executive director of rOpenSci, a nonprofit software foundation. None of the grant abstracts reviewed by The New York Times called for censoring content.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Cuts Off Budding CUNY Scientists From Mentorship and Aid\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/05/14/cuny-urise-science-research-nih-trump/\n\nThe Trump administration has cut off support that has sustained a teaching model that for decades has been instrumental in catapulting students into careers as scientists.\n\n\nFunded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE) supports the pursuit of advanced degrees by students in the biomedical field, who are offered tuition assistance, mentorship, registration to professional conferences and, crucially, lab experience.\n\n\nNIH canceled all U-RISE funding at City College, Queens College, Brooklyn College, Lehman College and Medgar Evers College. … Professors who work with students in the program say the federal defunding will likely doom the program, and with it vital opportunities to conduct research while attending a public college — putting them on track for further academic research.\n\n\n“University leadership is working to support everyone in our community and will pursue every avenue available to sustain CUNY as a preeminent research institution,” wrote Noah Gardy.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEH Announces Grant Opportunity to Create Statues of Iconic Americans for the National Garden of American Heroes | National Endowment for the Humanities\n\nhttps://www.neh.gov/news/neh-announces-grant-opportunity-create-statues-iconic-americans-national-garden-american\n(This isn’t new, but still galling)\n\nThe NIH Is Requiring Grantees to Follow Trump’s Anti-Trans Executive Order\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-nih-is-requiring-grantees-to-follow-trumps-anti-trans-executive-order\n\nAnd she [researcher at a teaching hospital] learned that the grantee was expected to comply with the gender-equity law Title IX — “including the requirements set forth in Presidential Executive Order 14168 titled Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” That’s the executive order President Trump signed on the first day of his second term, directing the government to recognize two sexes, male and female.\n\n\nThe new policies apply to institutions that accept funds on scientists’ behalf, according to two lawyers who reviewed the language. So if a university accepts a grant with these terms, it could be at risk if the government considers anyone at that campus — not just the scientist spending the money — to be perpetuating “DEI” or “gender ideology extremism.”\n\n\nThe NIH reserves the right to “terminate financial assistance awards and recover all funds,” states its April 21 policy on diversity. And the term sheet citing the anti-transgender executive order states that payments “are predicated on compliance with the above requirements.” It says that violators can be held liable criminally as well as under the False Claims Act, the anti-government defraudment law.\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Association of American Universities, which represents research universities, said that the organization was aware of the language, but declined to comment further.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Nominates Iowa Regent to be Assistant Secretary of Postsecondary Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/12/trump-nominates-assistant-secretary-postsecondary-ed\n\n[David] Barker would focus on improving outcomes and accountability by reforming accreditation, improving federal student aid programs and ensuring grant programs match the Trump administration’s priorities.\n\n\nBarker was an Iowa regent for six years where he advanced cost control measures, promoted academic freedom and ended “discriminatory DEI programs,” according to the release.\n\n(On wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_R._Barker] we can read about what planet this guy lives on: “Barker is the author of Welcome to Free America, a book set in 2057 as a guide to immigrants coming to the former United States after the collapse of government.

Harvard University alone could lose over $2 billion. And every Ivy but Dartmouth is being investigated over allegations that they have allowed antisemitism on campus.\n\n\nAnd Dr. Beilock appears to have carefully positioned her school in territory friendly to conservatives.

The change, according to the NSF, “is intended to streamline funding practices, increase transparency, and ensure that more resources are directed toward direct scientific and engineering research activities.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQatar has showered money on the U.S.’s military and universities, giving the tiny Gulf state outsize geopolitical clout\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/qatar-us-influence-spending-7a64dd75?st=JmAtR8&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nAround the same time that the base was gearing up, Qatar began paying top U.S. universities to operate campuses on Qatari territory. It is now the single largest foreign funder of American universities, according to U.S. Education Department data, providing more than $6 billion over the past 15 years through gifts or contracts with schools including Cornell, Georgetown and Northwestern.\n\n\nThe outsize higher-education funding levels have drawn criticism since the start of Israel’s war in Gaza from Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration over allegations that the money from Qatar and other Arab states was skewing teaching about Israel and the region. Education Secretary Linda McMahon singled out Qatar in an April 23 statement on an executive order expanding oversight on foreign education gifts.\n\n\nAnsari denied that Qatar interferes in the curriculum of any U.S. educational institution or has any influence on U.S. universities, calling that “deliberate misinformation” by “a campaign of bad actors” aiming to weaken the U.S. relationship and undermine Qatar’s mediation role in the Gaza war.\n\n(Not simply fake news, but bad actors)\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: The World Is Wooing U.S. Researchers Shunned by Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/business/economy/trump-research-brain-drain.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nNYTimes: We Study Fascism.

The university, it alleged, had violated Title IX by allowing transgender female students in women’s restrooms, locker rooms, and dorm rooms.\n\n\nPayton McNabb, a former student whose complaints about WCU’s transgender policies brought conservative media attention to the university, said she didn’t experience WCU as quiet. She felt professors treated conservative students differently, and she was hurt by a university Title IX investigation into her conduct after she posted a video of herself asking a transgender woman why she was in a women’s bathroom on campus.\n\n\nThe emails that seem to have triggered the Department of Education’s investigation have been framed by Speech First [a group dedicated to protecting the expression of certain conservative stances at colleges] as evidence that WCU is deliberately defying President Donald Trump.\n\n\nThe Department of Education’s scrutiny “feels punitive,” Gómez [secretary for the Faculty Senate] said. “It feels like this is part of a trend to both try to dismantle higher education and to ultimately undermine faculty governance and academic freedom.” The department’s Title IX investigation is related to faculty governance, Gómez said, because the Faculty Senate had previously supported an effort to make campus bathrooms more welcoming to transgender people.\n\n\nOn Student Aid, It’s Congressional Republicans vs. DOGE\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/on-student-aid-its-congressional-republicans-vs-doge\n\nThe House Committee on Education & Workforce recently drafted legislation that would cut $350 billion in student aid. The savings come mostly from increasing loan-payment requirements and making it harder to qualify for Pell Grants. As others have explained, these measures will harm the lowest-income borrowers and reduce college access. If the committee has its way, the cuts will be bundled into a reconciliation bill in which these savings would pay for tax cuts tilted heavily toward the wealthy.\n\n\nanother surprising roadblock to the House accountability provisions should loom large: …DOGE. … Now that DOGE has forced out half the Education Department’s staff and President Trump is looking to eviscerate it, such execution will be out of reach. In other words, today’s Republican Party has a lot of different factions, but they can’t all win: If conservative lawmakers mean for the department to implement the accountability ideas in their current proposal, they will need to confront the Trump administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nSurely Not?\n\nhttps://www.nybooks.com/articles/2025/05/29/surely-not-manchurian-candidate-president/\n(VAC says this is worth reading, though it is behind a paywall.)\n\nImagine that the president of the United States was a “Manchurian candidate,” an embedded foreign agent determined to wreak maximum damage on the country and limited only by the need not to act so outrageously and preposterously as to blow his cover.

It informed the organizers of a Danish lecture series — one I was soon scheduled to speak at — that the final portion of American funding would be released only after they signed a statement essentially saying they were in compliance with a U.S. executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n\nBefore the organizers at the University of Southern Denmark could respond, the U.S. State Department sent an even blunter message: The grant was “being terminated for the convenience of the U.S. government.” It concluded by thanking the Danes “for your partnering with the Department of State and God Bless America.”\n\n\nSecond, the cutoff of funding was followed nearly two weeks later by another message to the university. (I viewed copies of all the emails.) It said that a recent court hearing prevented the State Department from holding up congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds and ordered it to make the financing available. It further ordered the department to “provide written notice of this order” to recipients of grants. Notifying the Danish university was as far as the administration went in complying with the court. The remaining funds haven’t been released yet, organizers say — typical of the Trump administration’s defiance of the courts.\n\n\nAnother core element of freedom — indeed something essential to its survival — is that power must be limited; there have to be checks and balances not just within government but within society. I have long warned that the concentration of wealth among a small percentage of the population would provide a fertile field for a demagogue, and that there was an ample supply of people who might play the part.\n\n\nUniversities, which protect academic freedom, are as important to this system of checks and balances as other civil rights protections like freedom of the press.\n\n\nNYU Withholds Diploma Due to Pro-Palestinian Commencement Speech\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/16/nyu-withholds-diploma-due-pro-palestinian-grad-speech\n\nRozos spoke at the ceremony for the university’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study.

At the detention center, there is no access to computers and six phones are shared among all of us. The calls cost $5 for 15 minutes, at which point they cut off. It’s constantly noisy and cold. Fortunately, my beautiful colleagues have mailed me academic articles and books (I’m reading a wonderful one now about biochemistry called “Transformer” that I recommend to everyone).",

    "text": "Can Scientific Research Survive Without Federal Funding?\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/business/revenue-strategies/2025/05/12/can-scientific-research-survive-without-federal-funding\n\nIn February, the Yale School of Medicine began offering temporary funding to researchers with terminated grants—many related to topics the Trump administration has deemed unworthy of scientific inquiry, such as transgender health—to give them time to reorient their research. Yale’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is also investing $4 million to support graduate students who have lost training and research grants. Similarly, last month Johns Hopkins University announced that it is tapping earnings from its $13.2 billion endowment to give researchers $100,000 each for delayed grants, or $150,000 for terminated grants, during a 12-month period. And Northwestern University—which hasn’t received any grant payments from the National Institutes of Health since March—is offering faculty up to $50,000 to maintain projects for up to one year.\n\n(Hopefully CUNY will be providing some relief in this manner as well)\n\nOver the past several decades, universities have already substantially increased the amount of money they spend on their own research and development—from 10 percent of the total in 1970 to 25 percent in 2023, according to federal data. Meanwhile, federal support for academic research has been on the decline, falling from 71 percent to 55 percent during that same timeframe. And support from industry, charities and other sources have always been marginal, collectively making up about 15 percent of contributions to research funding at colleges and universities in 2023.\n\n\nWhile that won’t cover all of the terminated grants, “the bridge has to go somewhere,” he said, explaining that the program isn’t supporting projects that don’t have viable alternative long-term funding options. Instead, “we’re providing funding for projects where the faculty member has other sources of funding and other proposals with the same or different federal agencies,” Díaz de la Rubia said.

That number would climb to a 14 percent tax for colleges with endowments valued at $1.25 to $2 million per student. Colleges at the highest level with endowments of $2 million or more per student would pay 21 percent. (Currently, colleges with endowments worth $500,000 per student or more pay the 1.4 percent tax.)\n\n(This is for private colleges.

Thanks VAC)\n\n\n\n\nWhy I’m Resigning from the NSF and Library of Congress | TIME\n\nhttps://time.com/7285045/resigning-national-science-foundation-library-congress/\n\nFreedom of expression is not merely an abstract principle, or even a constitutional right, but a practical necessity for meaningful advisory work. In Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, published as short stories in the late 1940s and as a novel in 1953, warned not only of the destruction of books, but of a society in which people had lost the desire to read them. The parallel today is not only the administration’s effort to destroy and suppress knowledge, but also the institution’s willingness to accept the cultivated irrelevance of it—a challenge that undermines any serious effort to conduct research, inform policy, or guide public institutions.\n\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF)—established as an independent agency through the National Science Act of 1950 and marking its 75th anniversary this week—traces its roots to Vannevar Bush’s landmark report, “Science, the Endless Frontier,” addressed to President Harry S. Truman. But we might also see the establishment of this premier research institution as reflecting a response to fears depicted by Bradbury. The NSF can be understood not only as a catalyst of scientific promise for national purpose, but also as a guarded response to fears about centralized control over knowledge and thought, shaped by the dark shadows of the Third Reich and the emerging Red Scare.\n\n\nLast week, as the Board held its 494th meeting, I listened to NSF staff say that DOGE had by fiat the authority to give thumbs up or down to grant applications which had been systematically vetted by layers of subject matter experts.\n\n\nOur closed-to-the-public deliberations were observed by Zachary Terrell from the DOGE team. Through his Zoom screen, Terrell showed more interest in his water bottle and his cuticles than in the discussion. According to Nature Terrell, listed as a “consultant” in the NSF directory, had accessed the NSF awards system to block the dispersal of approved grants. The message I received was that the National Science Board had a role to play in name only.\n\n\nAll of this is threatened by the creeping normalization of authoritarian approaches to knowledge management and academic freedom. The National Science Board has not been disbanded like so many other statutorily established, independent agencies in the federal government. But preservation of form provides little consolation when function has been strategically neutralized, mirroring the backsliding that scholars have thoroughly documented: maintaining legitimacy for institutions that no longer honor their founding purposes. This hollowing out is not just about governance in the abstract, it has material consequences for which research questions get asked, which datasets get produced, which knowledge gets produced, and which perspectives shape our understanding of pressing societal challenges. It has consequences for the integrity of knowledge itself.\n\n\nLast week, the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, was summarily dismissed via an email addressed to “Carla” from a White House HR administrator. The Trump Administration claimed that she was fired for “things she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.” It is true that Hayden was repeatedly on record as saying the Library should be for all Americans. And it is false that the Library, which is intended to hold all books published in the United States, lends books to children. The ouster of Hayden is part of a broader pattern of political targeting of women and Black public servants across the federal government.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Cancels Scores of Grants to Study Online Misinformation\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/trump-online-misinformation-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast month, the National Science Foundation, a government agency that finances much of the scientific research in the United States, began canceling hundreds of grants. Most focused on studies involving issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, but scores singled out work on online content.\n\n\nThe cancellation has jeopardized research in universities in virtually every state, leaving researchers scrambling to find funding for projects that in many cases are only partly completed.\n\n\nEach Friday since then, the foundation has announced new cancellations. It has now cut more than 1,400 grants, including 75 more last Friday. In all, the grants were worth more than $1 billion, according to a list compiled by two researchers, Scott W. Delaney, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health, and Noam Ross, the executive director of rOpenSci, a nonprofit software foundation. None of the grant abstracts reviewed by The New York Times called for censoring content.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Cuts Off Budding CUNY Scientists From Mentorship and Aid\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/05/14/cuny-urise-science-research-nih-trump/\n\nThe Trump administration has cut off support that has sustained a teaching model that for decades has been instrumental in catapulting students into careers as scientists.\n\n\nFunded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE) supports the pursuit of advanced degrees by students in the biomedical field, who are offered tuition assistance, mentorship, registration to professional conferences and, crucially, lab experience.\n\n\nNIH canceled all U-RISE funding at City College, Queens College, Brooklyn College, Lehman College and Medgar Evers College. … Professors who work with students in the program say the federal defunding will likely doom the program, and with it vital opportunities to conduct research while attending a public college — putting them on track for further academic research.\n\n\n“University leadership is working to support everyone in our community and will pursue every avenue available to sustain CUNY as a preeminent research institution,” wrote Noah Gardy.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEH Announces Grant Opportunity to Create Statues of Iconic Americans for the National Garden of American Heroes | National Endowment for the Humanities\n\nhttps://www.neh.gov/news/neh-announces-grant-opportunity-create-statues-iconic-americans-national-garden-american\n(This isn’t new, but still galling)\n\nThe NIH Is Requiring Grantees to Follow Trump’s Anti-Trans Executive Order\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-nih-is-requiring-grantees-to-follow-trumps-anti-trans-executive-order\n\nAnd she [researcher at a teaching hospital] learned that the grantee was expected to comply with the gender-equity law Title IX — “including the requirements set forth in Presidential Executive Order 14168 titled Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” That’s the executive order President Trump signed on the first day of his second term, directing the government to recognize two sexes, male and female.\n\n\nThe new policies apply to institutions that accept funds on scientists’ behalf, according to two lawyers who reviewed the language. So if a university accepts a grant with these terms, it could be at risk if the government considers anyone at that campus — not just the scientist spending the money — to be perpetuating “DEI” or “gender ideology extremism.”\n\n\nThe NIH reserves the right to “terminate financial assistance awards and recover all funds,” states its April 21 policy on diversity. And the term sheet citing the anti-transgender executive order states that payments “are predicated on compliance with the above requirements.” It says that violators can be held liable criminally as well as under the False Claims Act, the anti-government defraudment law.\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Association of American Universities, which represents research universities, said that the organization was aware of the language, but declined to comment further.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Nominates Iowa Regent to be Assistant Secretary of Postsecondary Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/12/trump-nominates-assistant-secretary-postsecondary-ed\n\n[David] Barker would focus on improving outcomes and accountability by reforming accreditation, improving federal student aid programs and ensuring grant programs match the Trump administration’s priorities.\n\n\nBarker was an Iowa regent for six years where he advanced cost control measures, promoted academic freedom and ended “discriminatory DEI programs,” according to the release.\n\n(On wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_R._Barker] we can read about what planet this guy lives on: “Barker is the author of Welcome to Free America, a book set in 2057 as a guide to immigrants coming to the former United States after the collapse of government. It describes a difficult period of transition, but eventually, private companies take over functions previously performed by governments, such as security, dispute resolution, production of money and infrastructure, and national defense.”)\n\n\n\n\nThe hidden ways Trump, DOGE are shutting down parts of the U.S. government\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/05/11/trump-government-operations-halt-funding-cuts/\n(Nothing higher ed related, but similar things are reported with grants.

The university, it alleged, had violated Title IX by allowing transgender female students in women’s restrooms, locker rooms, and dorm rooms.\n\n\nPayton McNabb, a former student whose complaints about WCU’s transgender policies brought conservative media attention to the university, said she didn’t experience WCU as quiet. She felt professors treated conservative students differently, and she was hurt by a university Title IX investigation into her conduct after she posted a video of herself asking a transgender woman why she was in a women’s bathroom on campus.\n\n\nThe emails that seem to have triggered the Department of Education’s investigation have been framed by Speech First [a group dedicated to protecting the expression of certain conservative stances at colleges] as evidence that WCU is deliberately defying President Donald Trump.\n\n\nThe Department of Education’s scrutiny “feels punitive,” Gómez [secretary for the Faculty Senate] said. “It feels like this is part of a trend to both try to dismantle higher education and to ultimately undermine faculty governance and academic freedom.” The department’s Title IX investigation is related to faculty governance, Gómez said, because the Faculty Senate had previously supported an effort to make campus bathrooms more welcoming to transgender people.\n\n\nOn Student Aid, It’s Congressional Republicans vs. DOGE\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/on-student-aid-its-congressional-republicans-vs-doge\n\nThe House Committee on Education & Workforce recently drafted legislation that would cut $350 billion in student aid. The savings come mostly from increasing loan-payment requirements and making it harder to qualify for Pell Grants. As others have explained, these measures will harm the lowest-income borrowers and reduce college access. If the committee has its way, the cuts will be bundled into a reconciliation bill in which these savings would pay for tax cuts tilted heavily toward the wealthy.\n\n\nanother surprising roadblock to the House accountability provisions should loom large: …DOGE. … Now that DOGE has forced out half the Education Department’s staff and President Trump is looking to eviscerate it, such execution will be out of reach. In other words, today’s Republican Party has a lot of different factions, but they can’t all win: If conservative lawmakers mean for the department to implement the accountability ideas in their current proposal, they will need to confront the Trump administration.",

That idea has found quite wide use)\n\nNow the Heritage contingent was in Israel, in part, to discuss another contentious policy paper: Project Esther, the foundation’s proposal to rapidly dismantle the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States, along with its support at schools and universities, at progressive organizations and in Congress.\n\n\nDrafted in the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel in 2023 and the mounting protests against the war in Gaza, Project Esther outlined an ambitious plan to fight antisemitism by branding a broad range of critics of Israel as “effectively a terrorist support network,” so that they could be deported, defunded, sued, fired, expelled, ostracized and otherwise excluded from what it considered “open society.”\n\n\nProject Esther’s architects envisioned outcomes that at the time might have seemed far-fetched. Curriculum it believed to be sympathetic to a “Hamas support” narrative would be taken out of schools and universities, and “supporting faculty” would be removed. Social media would be purged of content deemed to be antisemitic. Institutions would lose public funding. Foreign students who pushed for Palestinian rights would have their visas revoked, or be deported.\n\n\nHeritage national security director who coauthored Project Esther, said it was “no coincidence that we called for a series of actions to take place privately and publicly, and they are now happening.”\n\n\nBut Project Esther aims to go further, equating actions such as participating in pro-Palestinian campus protests with providing “material support” for terrorism, a broad legal construct that can lead to prison time, deportations, civil penalties and other serious consequences.\n\n\n“Project Esther changed the paradigm by associating anyone who opposes Israeli policies with the ‘Hamas Support Network,’”\n\n\nSome evangelical Christians have increasingly aligned themselves with conservative political forces in Israel, supporting their claims of biblical dominion over contested Palestinian territories. Many feel a kinship with Israel because of shared religious heritage. But some also believe that supporting Israel will hasten biblical end times, or advance Christianity’s global influence.\n\n\nThe Visionary of Trump 2.0 - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/russell-vought-trump-doge/682821/\n(Russel Vought takes over for Elon Musk in efforts to kill this federal government. But he is more patient and will have a longer impact)\nOne example is “https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-quietly-kills-rule-to-shield-americans-from-data-brokers/\n\nTrump’s Attacks on International Students Are the Start of a Wider War | The New Republic\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/195142/trump-war-international-students-university\n\nIn recent months, foreign students—particularly those participating in pro-Palestine protests—have had their student visas threatened or have been detained and placed in deportation proceedings, signaling a sharp and politically charged shift in federal policy. At the same time, public and private research universities, which depend heavily on international students’ tuition and labor—especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines—are facing the erosion of a vital economic pillar. These developments threaten not only the foundational rights of free speech and academic freedom but also the financial stability of the institutions that anchor the U.S. higher education system and conduct the vital research on which the future will be built.\n\n\nFar from isolated incidents, these cases reflect an emerging strategy—leveraging immigration enforcement as a tool of political suppression. International students have become an ideal scapegoat: politically vulnerable, culturally diverse, and often outspoken. Immigration officials now claim broad authority to revoke visas for “supporting terrorism,” using vague, expansive definitions. The result is a chilling effect on campus expression and a stark warning to those who would protest U.S. policy.\n\n\nFor academic leaders like Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, the strategy is transparent. “They want to undermine higher education and also heighten the new Cold War on campus,” Wolfson said.\n\nIs the University Of Austin Betraying Its Founding Principles?\nhttps://quillette.com/2025/05/16/is-the-university-of-austin-betraying-its-founding-principles/\n\nSkilled immigration on the chopping block? Effects of eliminating “Optional Practical Training” in the US | PIIE\n\nhttps://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/skilled-immigration-chopping-block-effects-eliminating-optional\n\nThat may soon change. The US administration is under pressure to constrict or eliminate the largest single pipeline into lawful immigration for high-skilled, university-educated workers. This pipeline is called Optional Practical Training (OPT)—a temporary work permit given to some foreign graduates of US universities.\n\n\nOptional Practical Training is a federal program that allows most international students at US universities the choice to work in the United States for a limited period after they graduate. About 72 percent of foreign graduates use OPT. The permit generally lasts one year but extends to three years for graduates at any educational level in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is a work permit attached to the student visa, a bridge between university enrollment and the workforce, granted under regulations starting in 1947.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nThis [expecting a renaissance of rich controversies], of course, is politically naïve. As the historian of science Michael Hagner predicted in 2019, the commitment of right-wing populists to epistemic pluralism only lasts until they manage to establish their own views well enough to eliminate all other points of view. Consider book bans, grant cancellations, and the violation of the First Amendment rights of foreign students and faculty and you will find validated Hagner’s cynical perspective on the authoritarian promotion of viewpoint diversity.\n\n\nBoth Harding and Haidt put their fingers on a very real problem: Our collective thinking benefits from looking at any given issue from multiple angles. For all sorts of historical reasons, colleges often do not represent a spectrum that is broad enough.\n\n\nThis balancing act requires what Aristotle called phronesis, the capacity for good judgment, and it cannot be formalized through viewpoint-diversity audits and affirmative-action policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Comey questioning, the Trump administration again targets speech\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/17/trump-freedom-of-speech-critics/\n(Just 4 numbers is enough now…)\n\nCollege newspapers under pressure as immigration fears silence sources\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/17/college-newspapers-trump-international-students/\n\nFree speech is dead at the American university.

I think, from my vantage point, one of the greatest concerns is seeing students, and particularly international students, being, basically, taken away on what appears to be the basis of viewpoints and opinions that they might have shared, either in the form of protest or, in one case, an op-ed. That really flies in the face of exactly what the First Amendment is supposed to protect against, especially in a public institution, which is that it’s supposed to be a restraint on government.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Times Sq.

White of the Northern District of California, who was appointed to the court by President George W. Bush, granted a temporary injunction protecting international students who were among the thousands whose visas were revoked earlier this year without clear justification, writing that government officials had “uniformly wreaked havoc” and “likely exceeded their authority and acted arbitrarily and capriciously” by the mass revocation of students’ immigration status.\n\n\nJudge White’s ruling said that the order applied to all “similarly situated individuals” who participate in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which is the system governing student visas. In the order, he expressed suspicion that the Trump administration was trying to place future visa “terminations beyond judicial review.”\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Has Cut Science Funding to Its Lowest Level in Decades\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/22/upshot/nsf-grants-trump-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(With a great graphic.

In particular, we are concerned about the damaging proposed changes to student aid programs, including eligibility changes that will prevent many low-income students from accessing Pell Grants; the availability of federal student loans for graduate students; new and increased taxes imposed on our institutions of higher education; and significant cuts to other programs supporting millions of postsecondary students nationwide.\n\n\nNYTimes: Republicans Harness Tax Code to Punish Trump’s Political Nemeses\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/republicans-taxes-trump-opponents.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe legislation, which could change as it heads to the Senate, would raise taxes on universities like Harvard, as well as on immigrants and on companies based in countries with taxes that the Trump administration deems unfair.\n\n\n“If you’re an ideological friend of Trump, you’re in generally good shape,” said William Gale, a co-director of the Tax Policy Center, a think tank. “If you’re an ideological foe, you pay more.” The increases, he added, “feel very punitive.”\n\n\nWhile the tax [investment returns generated by their endowments] would represent a huge new cost for Harvard and other affected schools, it would raise less than $7 billion in government revenue over 10 years — a pittance compared with the trillions in tax cuts otherwise included in the bill.\n\n\n\n\nNSF terminates huge number of grants and stops awarding new ones\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01513-1\n(A podcast.

One exchange escalated when Pennsylvania Democratic representative Madeleine Dean, who was just appointed to the committee in January, repeatedly interrupted McMahon to ask why she “didn’t want to protect students” of color, with disabilities or from low-income families.\n\n\n“Why in God’s name do you want to shutter [the Education Department]?” she asked, exasperated. “Why are you in this job at all if you don’t have a dedication to the future of our children?

Brandon Jones, president of the American Geophysical Union: Scientific societies — professional organizations that represent researchers in specific fields — have a long history of stepping in when politics interferes with research. After the Trump administration suspended work in April on the U.S. government’s flagship report on the impacts of climate change, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society partnered with plans to publish some of the research so the public can still access the findings.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a mini N.I.H. Andrew Marks, professor of physiology at Columbia University: We need a new funding model for science research. I propose the creation of the American Research Collaborative, a kind of mini-National Institutes of Health that could provide funding for universities. The A.R.C. would be led by a governing board elected by member organizations like the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Universities could opt in, and the collaborative’s tax-exempt status would attract private donors. a\n\n\n\n\nBuild new alliances. Dr. Jane Lubchenco, co-founder of United by Nature: In January, over 100 scientists outside the federal government were struggling to come to grips with the administration’s cancellation of years of work on what would have been the first ever federal assessment of nature. We refused to quit. So we created a new path to deliver the report and show why the information matters.

Scientists who cannot support their labs while President Trump holds their funds hostage for the sake of MAGA theater over the next four years will take their labs elsewhere.\n\n\nChina will be a winner in this. Uncertainty about government commitments will make it harder for investors to take basic and applied research in universities and move it to market. The longer the time horizon for investments, the more trust and stability matter.

Fear, particularly about the future of financial aid and immigration crackdowns, is pervasive.\n\n\nBut the college [Delta] is also planning for contingencies. “If somehow the government is going to withhold federal financial-aid dollars going to students based on something,” Gavin said, “then that will be where we have to change.”\n\n\nDavid Tandberg, president of Adams State University, said he has tried to sort the administration’s actions into several buckets based on whether they would have a direct impact on his campus — a public regional institution in rural, southern Colorado — and whether they’re probably just rhetoric. “We’re seeing all of those, and it takes a lot to sort through them,” Tandberg said. “The first month it was coming like a fire hose.”\n\n\nSimilar to Delta College, an urgent concern for a university like Adams State is whether federal cuts could slow or stop the flow of student financial aid,\n\n\n\n\n\nAt universities from the Ivy League to state schools, a financial reckoning has started as President Trump’s funding cuts hit home\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/university-spending-cuts-layoffs-pay-budget-trump-9f261d14?st=ErRuU9&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nNYTimes: Republican Plan to Tax Elite Colleges Could Hit in Unexpected Places\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/universities-endowment-tax-republicans.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe goal of the proposal, laid out in a report last week from Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, is to hold accountable “woke, elite universities that operate more like major corporations.” McPherson [small school that accepts the vast majority of its applicants] could be on the list because it has an endowment of $1.6 billion, thanks to an anonymous donation a few years ago.\n\n(Don’t cry for McPherson, cry that this stealing from the rich to give to the richer is even being proposed.)\n\nChinese College Gives Harvard International Students ‘Unconditional Offers’ - Newsweek\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/harvard-hkust-china-college-international-students-offer-2076257\n\n\n\n\nHow I Lost Faith in My University’s Mission\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/05/19/how-i-lost-faith-my-universitys-mission-opinion\n(Look at all the interventions from outside that have happened at the University of Utah)\n\nthe State Legislature passed an anti-DEI bill, prohibiting, among other things, offices and programs related to diversity, equity or inclusion. Administrators were required to purge these three words from university websites and other documents, such as RPT—retention, promotion and tenure review—guidelines, and the university administration interpreted the law as requiring that the Women’s Resource Center, the Black Cultural Center and the LGBT Resource Center be shuttered.\n\n\nThe state has also imposed a “bathroom bill” requiring trans university students to use locker rooms aligning with their sex assigned at birth, has banned Pride flags in public spaces (and in faculty offices if they can be seen through a window), and now requires faculty to post their syllabi in a publicly searchable database. It also prohibits university presidents from taking a stand on any issue that does not bear upon the “mission, role or pedagogical objectives” of the institution. And finally, as the coup de grâce for academic freedom and faculty expertise, it has funded and established the Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that all students take general education courses on the topics of Western civilization and the rise of Christianity. The law establishing the center identifies it as a pilot program to be rolled out to other Utah universities in the future.\n\n\nRecently passed laws dictate the process by which all post-tenure reviews of faculty must be conducted, curtail shared governance and cut state funds to all Utah public institutions by 10 percent ($60.5 million). Universities can have the funds “reallocated” if they use them for high-demand, high-wage majors. As a result, we lost our History and Philosophy of Science major, which drew some of our best students, many of them double majoring in STEM subjects and working toward careers in medicine and public health.\n\n\n\n\n\nReviewing Course Evaluations: The Drinking Game - McSweeney’s Internet Tendency\n\nhttps://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/reviewing-course-evaluations-the-drinking-game\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

    "text": "NYTimes: The Group Behind Project 2025 Has a Plan to Crush the Pro-Palestinian Movement\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/us/project-esther-heritage-foundation-palestine.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(This article discusses the engineered backlash against protesters by the Heritage Foundation using federal funding as the cudgel. That idea has found quite wide use)\n\nNow the Heritage contingent was in Israel, in part, to discuss another contentious policy paper: Project Esther, the foundation’s proposal to rapidly dismantle the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States, along with its support at schools and universities, at progressive organizations and in Congress.\n\n\nDrafted in the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel in 2023 and the mounting protests against the war in Gaza, Project Esther outlined an ambitious plan to fight antisemitism by branding a broad range of critics of Israel as “effectively a terrorist support network,” so that they could be deported, defunded, sued, fired, expelled, ostracized and otherwise excluded from what it considered “open society.”\n\n\nProject Esther’s architects envisioned outcomes that at the time might have seemed far-fetched. Curriculum it believed to be sympathetic to a “Hamas support” narrative would be taken out of schools and universities, and “supporting faculty” would be removed. Social media would be purged of content deemed to be antisemitic. Institutions would lose public funding. Foreign students who pushed for Palestinian rights would have their visas revoked, or be deported.\n\n\nHeritage national security director who coauthored Project Esther, said it was “no coincidence that we called for a series of actions to take place privately and publicly, and they are now happening.”\n\n\nBut Project Esther aims to go further, equating actions such as participating in pro-Palestinian campus protests with providing “material support” for terrorism, a broad legal construct that can lead to prison time, deportations, civil penalties and other serious consequences.\n\n\n“Project Esther changed the paradigm by associating anyone who opposes Israeli policies with the ‘Hamas Support Network,’”\n\n\nSome evangelical Christians have increasingly aligned themselves with conservative political forces in Israel, supporting their claims of biblical dominion over contested Palestinian territories. Many feel a kinship with Israel because of shared religious heritage. But some also believe that supporting Israel will hasten biblical end times, or advance Christianity’s global influence.\n\n\nThe Visionary of Trump 2.0 - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/russell-vought-trump-doge/682821/\n(Russel Vought takes over for Elon Musk in efforts to kill this federal government. But he is more patient and will have a longer impact)\nOne example is “https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-quietly-kills-rule-to-shield-americans-from-data-brokers/\n\nTrump’s Attacks on International Students Are the Start of a Wider War | The New Republic\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/195142/trump-war-international-students-university\n\nIn recent months, foreign students—particularly those participating in pro-Palestine protests—have had their student visas threatened or have been detained and placed in deportation proceedings, signaling a sharp and politically charged shift in federal policy. At the same time, public and private research universities, which depend heavily on international students’ tuition and labor—especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines—are facing the erosion of a vital economic pillar. These developments threaten not only the foundational rights of free speech and academic freedom but also the financial stability of the institutions that anchor the U.S. higher education system and conduct the vital research on which the future will be built.\n\n\nFar from isolated incidents, these cases reflect an emerging strategy—leveraging immigration enforcement as a tool of political suppression. International students have become an ideal scapegoat: politically vulnerable, culturally diverse, and often outspoken. Immigration officials now claim broad authority to revoke visas for “supporting terrorism,” using vague, expansive definitions. The result is a chilling effect on campus expression and a stark warning to those who would protest U.S. policy.\n\n\nFor academic leaders like Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, the strategy is transparent. “They want to undermine higher education and also heighten the new Cold War on campus,” Wolfson said.\n\nIs the University Of Austin Betraying Its Founding Principles?\nhttps://quillette.com/2025/05/16/is-the-university-of-austin-betraying-its-founding-principles/\n\nSkilled immigration on the chopping block? Effects of eliminating “Optional Practical Training” in the US | PIIE\n\nhttps://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/skilled-immigration-chopping-block-effects-eliminating-optional\n\nThat may soon change. The US administration is under pressure to constrict or eliminate the largest single pipeline into lawful immigration for high-skilled, university-educated workers. This pipeline is called Optional Practical Training (OPT)—a temporary work permit given to some foreign graduates of US universities.\n\n\nOptional Practical Training is a federal program that allows most international students at US universities the choice to work in the United States for a limited period after they graduate. About 72 percent of foreign graduates use OPT. The permit generally lasts one year but extends to three years for graduates at any educational level in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is a work permit attached to the student visa, a bridge between university enrollment and the workforce, granted under regulations starting in 1947.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nThis [expecting a renaissance of rich controversies], of course, is politically naïve. As the historian of science Michael Hagner predicted in 2019, the commitment of right-wing populists to epistemic pluralism only lasts until they manage to establish their own views well enough to eliminate all other points of view. Consider book bans, grant cancellations, and the violation of the First Amendment rights of foreign students and faculty and you will find validated Hagner’s cynical perspective on the authoritarian promotion of viewpoint diversity.\n\n\nBoth Harding and Haidt put their fingers on a very real problem: Our collective thinking benefits from looking at any given issue from multiple angles. For all sorts of historical reasons, colleges often do not represent a spectrum that is broad enough.\n\n\nThis balancing act requires what Aristotle called phronesis, the capacity for good judgment, and it cannot be formalized through viewpoint-diversity audits and affirmative-action policies.",

In particular, we are concerned about the damaging proposed changes to student aid programs, including eligibility changes that will prevent many low-income students from accessing Pell Grants; the availability of federal student loans for graduate students; new and increased taxes imposed on our institutions of higher education; and significant cuts to other programs supporting millions of postsecondary students nationwide.\n\n\nNYTimes: Republicans Harness Tax Code to Punish Trump’s Political Nemeses\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/republicans-taxes-trump-opponents.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe legislation, which could change as it heads to the Senate, would raise taxes on universities like Harvard, as well as on immigrants and on companies based in countries with taxes that the Trump administration deems unfair.\n\n\n“If you’re an ideological friend of Trump, you’re in generally good shape,” said William Gale, a co-director of the Tax Policy Center, a think tank. “If you’re an ideological foe, you pay more.” The increases, he added, “feel very punitive.”\n\n\nWhile the tax [investment returns generated by their endowments] would represent a huge new cost for Harvard and other affected schools, it would raise less than $7 billion in government revenue over 10 years — a pittance compared with the trillions in tax cuts otherwise included in the bill.\n\n\n\n\nNSF terminates huge number of grants and stops awarding new ones\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01513-1\n(A podcast.

One exchange escalated when Pennsylvania Democratic representative Madeleine Dean, who was just appointed to the committee in January, repeatedly interrupted McMahon to ask why she “didn’t want to protect students” of color, with disabilities or from low-income families.\n\n\n“Why in God’s name do you want to shutter [the Education Department]?” she asked, exasperated. “Why are you in this job at all if you don’t have a dedication to the future of our children?

Brandon Jones, president of the American Geophysical Union: Scientific societies — professional organizations that represent researchers in specific fields — have a long history of stepping in when politics interferes with research. After the Trump administration suspended work in April on the U.S. government’s flagship report on the impacts of climate change, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society partnered with plans to publish some of the research so the public can still access the findings.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a mini N.I.H. Andrew Marks, professor of physiology at Columbia University: We need a new funding model for science research. I propose the creation of the American Research Collaborative, a kind of mini-National Institutes of Health that could provide funding for universities. The A.R.C. would be led by a governing board elected by member organizations like the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Universities could opt in, and the collaborative’s tax-exempt status would attract private donors. a\n\n\n\n\nBuild new alliances. Dr. Jane Lubchenco, co-founder of United by Nature: In January, over 100 scientists outside the federal government were struggling to come to grips with the administration’s cancellation of years of work on what would have been the first ever federal assessment of nature. We refused to quit. So we created a new path to deliver the report and show why the information matters. The initiative, called United by Nature, will have a governing body, advisers and partners, independent peer review and extensive public engagement.\n\n\n\nNYTimes: The President Will Destroy You Now\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/opinion/trump-musk-doge-government.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe war on academic research will have long-lasting implications for technical innovation in America. Scientists who cannot support their labs while President Trump holds their funds hostage for the sake of MAGA theater over the next four years will take their labs elsewhere.\n\n\nChina will be a winner in this. Uncertainty about government commitments will make it harder for investors to take basic and applied research in universities and move it to market. The longer the time horizon for investments, the more trust and stability matter. In the end, disrupters like Trump and Musk leave us with a much bigger legacy of doubt and uncertainty than achievement.\n\n\nMost Colleges Aren’t a Target of Trump (Yet). Here’s How Their Presidents Are Leading.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/most-colleges-arent-a-target-of-trump-yet-heres-how-their-presidents-are-leading\n\nStill, campus leaders at community colleges and four-year public regional and private institutions — representing the vast majority of higher ed — say they do see impacts of Trump’s policies. Fear, particularly about the future of financial aid and immigration crackdowns, is pervasive.\n\n\nBut the college [Delta] is also planning for contingencies. “If somehow the government is going to withhold federal financial-aid dollars going to students based on something,” Gavin said, “then that will be where we have to change.”\n\n\nDavid Tandberg, president of Adams State University, said he has tried to sort the administration’s actions into several buckets based on whether they would have a direct impact on his campus — a public regional institution in rural, southern Colorado — and whether they’re probably just rhetoric. “We’re seeing all of those, and it takes a lot to sort through them,” Tandberg said. “The first month it was coming like a fire hose.”\n\n\nSimilar to Delta College, an urgent concern for a university like Adams State is whether federal cuts could slow or stop the flow of student financial aid,",

    "text": "How I Lost Faith in My University’s Mission\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/05/19/how-i-lost-faith-my-universitys-mission-opinion\n(Look at all the interventions from outside that have happened at the University of Utah)\n\nthe State Legislature passed an anti-DEI bill, prohibiting, among other things, offices and programs related to diversity, equity or inclusion. Administrators were required to purge these three words from university websites and other documents, such as RPT—retention, promotion and tenure review—guidelines, and the university administration interpreted the law as requiring that the Women’s Resource Center, the Black Cultural Center and the LGBT Resource Center be shuttered.\n\n\nThe state has also imposed a “bathroom bill” requiring trans university students to use locker rooms aligning with their sex assigned at birth, has banned Pride flags in public spaces (and in faculty offices if they can be seen through a window), and now requires faculty to post their syllabi in a publicly searchable database. It also prohibits university presidents from taking a stand on any issue that does not bear upon the “mission, role or pedagogical objectives” of the institution. And finally, as the coup de grâce for academic freedom and faculty expertise, it has funded and established the Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that all students take general education courses on the topics of Western civilization and the rise of Christianity. The law establishing the center identifies it as a pilot program to be rolled out to other Utah universities in the future.\n\n\nRecently passed laws dictate the process by which all post-tenure reviews of faculty must be conducted, curtail shared governance and cut state funds to all Utah public institutions by 10 percent ($60.5 million). Universities can have the funds “reallocated” if they use them for high-demand, high-wage majors. As a result, we lost our History and Philosophy of Science major, which drew some of our best students, many of them double majoring in STEM subjects and working toward careers in medicine and public health.",
