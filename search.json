Sadly, there is too much to track faithfully.\nFor a great roundup of other actions taken, this opinion piece by Dana Millbank is recommended: https://wapo.st/4hwKarw.\n\n\n\nAcademic freedom statements issued after Governor Hochul demanded the removal of a job ad at Hunter College:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/my5g55jprx5o64r4vzus0/AO9WLNUUIorJRhgTO1SupgY?rlkey=zvsqtp7ev781y4rqqjti8xaho&dl=0\n(Shared by EI)\nRecent activity includes a statement by the faculty senates of Guttman, Medger Evers, the College of Staten Island, and Hostos.\n\nColumbia AAUP Urges University to Reject Trump’s Demands\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/19/columbia-aaup-urges-university-reject-trumps-demands\n\n“Compliance would make Columbia complicit in its own destruction, stripping shared control of academic and student affairs from the faculty and administration and replacing the deliberative practices and structures of the university with peremptory fiats from outside the institution,” the AAUP chapter said in a statement Tuesday. “We see no evidence that compliance would assuage the hostility of the White House.”\n\n\nThe Cost of the Government’s Attack on Columbia (Princeton President)\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/columbia-academic-freedom/682088/\n\nThe Trump administration’s recent attack on Columbia University puts all of that [best collection of research universities] at risk, presenting the greatest threat to American universities since the Red Scare of the 1950s. Every American should be concerned.\n\n\nThe second turning point [first was development of academic freedom] came during World War II, when Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, created the modern partnership between the federal government and the country’s research universities. Bush recognized that by sponsoring research at universities, the United States could lead the world in discoveries and innovations. Over time, American universities became responsible for a large portion of the government’s scientific programs, accepting tens of billions of dollars a year to perform research that would make the country stronger and improve the lives of its citizens.\n\n\nNobody should suppose that this will stop at Columbia or with the specific academic programs targeted by the government’s letter.\n\n\nColumbia nearing agreement to give trump what he wants\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-is-nearing-agreement-to-give-trump-what-he-wants-14315bb3?st=HNVvxe&reflink=article_copyURL_share\n\nDiscussions on the board of trustees are still fluid—with sticking points—and could turn in a different direction before Thursday.\n\n\nAgreement to the demands doesn’t guarantee the federal funds will come back.

Republicans are also escalating their ongoing attacks on wealthy colleges with proposals to significantly increase the tax on university endowments.\n\n\nAnd all of that doesn’t even take into account the possibility that Republicans could revive parts of the College Cost Reduction Act—a comprehensive piece of legislation introduced last Congress to overhaul higher education. Although the bill itself has yet to be introduced, many of its provisions—such as requiring colleges to pay back a portion of students’ unpaid loans—could be part of the forthcoming reconciliation bill, a top priority for Congressional Republicans this spring that could mean billions in cuts to higher education.\n\n\nNorthwestern Journalism Professor Says Pro-Palestinian Activism Cost Him Tenure\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/21/pro-palestinian-journalism-professor-denied-tenure\n\n“Shared Governance Is Crumbling”\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/shared-governance-is-crumbling\n\nAcademic freedom is about the freedom to choose: the freedom to research this problem and not that one, to consider or advance one argument in the classroom and to criticize another. But freedom of choice only means something if the choices themselves are meaningful. Part of how colleges and universities make sure faculty members’ choices have meaning is through shared governance. And shared governance is under attack.\n\n\nAs part of the ongoing legislative attack on academic freedom and campus free speech, state-level proposals to alter university governance and remove faculty from decision-making have bubbled up across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nCUNY Programming cut – a private funder (Thanks MP)\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/newsletter/private-funder-axes-cuny-diversity-initiative/\n\nThe country’s largest private funder of biomedical research has cut its funding for a program at Queens College that had focused on making science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education more inclusive and engaging for students of diverse backgrounds, the college confirmed to THE CITY.\n\n\nThe Inclusive Excellence initiative, launched at the Flushing-based CUNY college in 2022 with funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), ended abruptly last month when the Institute cut short what was supposed to be a $505,000, six-year grant running through 2028.\n\n\nByrd hoped that because the program wasn’t funded by the federal government, but privately, that it would continue on. An HHMI spokesperson declined to provide an explanation for why they pulled the plug.\n\n\n“The Authoritarian Endgame on Higher Education”\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/opinion/trump-research-cuts.html?unlocked_article_code=1.4E4.keqa.qHwBu9NLKbAp&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nAKA, why would one want to kill the golden goose of Higher Ed.\nAlso, CUNY faculty member amongst a trio on “A Really Easy Mark for Trump: Three Columnists on the Threats to Elite Colleges”:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/opinion/trump-research-cuts.html?unlocked_article_code=1.4E4.keqa.qHwBu9NLKbAp&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBetter to fight like men than die like cowards, or something like that\n\n\nAs I wrote above, this is a campaign of destruction. A Russian scholar I know wrote recently that he thought that Trump 2.0 would be like the Chinese Cultural Revolution, but it’s turning out to be more like the Russian Civil War — just utter devastation, the effects of which will be felt for generations.\n\n\nI think that university presidents need to gather together their administrators, faculty members and students — don’t forget the students! — and remind them of these values and call on them to unite to affirm them. This is a very hard thing to do while under attack, to get out of a defensive crouch and try to stand up and lead, but it could point the way forward, and not just for universities.\n\n\nDemands on Columbia to restore funding “Reflect Assault on Higher Ed”\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/03/14/trump-escalates-attack-columbia-his-latest-demands\nThese include: overhaul its discipline process, ban masks, expel some students, put an academic department under review, give its campus security “full law enforcement authority” and reform its admissions practices.\n\nImpact of funding cuts at Columbia\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/03/13/trumps-columbia-cuts-start-hitting-postdocs-professors\n\nImpact on hiring due to uncertainty on federal funding\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/business/cost-cutting/2025/03/14/more-colleges-freeze-hiring-amid-federal-funding-uncertainty\n\nNYU Administration letter to faculty\n\n(select excerpts; thanks KB)\n\nBased on recent federal actions, we’ve identified a number of financial risk areas for the University ranging from federal cuts to research funding to tariffs, as well as a range of other proposals that could affect our overall budget. We don’t yet know whether, when, or to what extent these or other measures may be enacted. In the meantime, we continue to vigorously advocate for robust federal support of higher education. Given the scale of potential outcomes, however, we need to address risks sooner than later.\n\n\nWe are implementing an administrative hiring freeze effective immediately. Th\n\n\nWe anticipate that salary increases for faculty and administrative staff will be lower than they have been in recent years.\n\n\nWe are asking schools and units to prepare contingency plans for more cuts at several levels, so we can respond nimbly should additional budget adjustments be required.\n\n\nWe do not want in any way to minimize the difficulties facing us, but neither will we embrace hopelessness. NYU—and its faculty, students, administrators, and staff—have navigated arduous moments before in our nearly 200-year history while preserving what is important, fulfilling our mission, supporting our community, sustaining our academic trajectory, and being good stewards of the University’s resources. We will do so again now.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Culture War Is No Longer Just a Culture War\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/opinion/trump-khalil-columbia-speech.html\n\nIn other words, universities possess a double obligation — to protect students and faculty and staff members from discrimination and harassment, while also protecting free expression on campus. It’s not an easy task.\n\n\nfederal statutes and regulations permit termination of federal financial assistance only when “compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means” and when “there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply.”\n\n\nColumbia has become Patient Zero in an outbreak of censorship and repression. And unless it’s stopped there, expect more universities to yield to Trump’s control. Expect political repression to spread far beyond the borders of the university.\n\n\n“The End of the University as We Know It”\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/opinion/university-defunding-trump-rufo.html\n\nThe result, if all goes through, will be nothing less than the permanent diminishment of research universities and an upheaval of the free speech principles at the core of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nAppeals Court Overturns Block on Parts of Trump’s DEI Orders\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/17/appeals-court-overturns-block-parts-trumps-dei-orders\n\nAhead of the Fourth Circuit’s ruling, the plaintiffs who sued the Trump administration over the orders, including the American Association of University Professors and the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, told the district judge that officials weren’t complying with the injunction.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Education Department Investigates Dozens of Colleges for Discrimination”\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/race-ethnicity/2025/03/15/education-department-accuses-51-colleges-discrimination\nPerhaps due to support of the PhD Project\n\nStates sue to block DOE layoffs\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/03/14/states-file-lawsuit-challenging-education-department-cuts\n\nIs Title VI the New Title IX?\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/is-title-vi-the-new-title-ix\nMentions complaints about pace of investigation process at Baruch\n(CUNY had voluntary agreements for both titles.)\n\nIs this the end of the Department of Education?\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/03/19/trump-signs-order-break-education-department\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed the long-awaited executive order Thursday directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to close down her department “to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.”\n\n\nThe order won’t result in the immediate closure of the 45-year-old agency; only Congress can get rid of the department.\n\n\n\n\nTrump is setting the US on a path to educational authoritarianism (thanks EI)\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/17/trump-us-path-educational-authoritarianism\n\nThe most straightforward way to read the letter and the guidelines is as defining “school-on-student harassment” as including Black history. The letter treats teaching large swaths of Black and Indigenous history as akin to a white professor consistently referring to all of their Black students with a terrible racial slur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgetown University graduate student detained by immigration authorities\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/georgetown-university-graduate-student-detained-immigration-authoritie-rcna197206\n\nMasked agents arrested the student, Badar Khan Suri, outside his home in Arlington, Virginia, on Monday night, attorney Hassan Ahmad said.\n\n\nHere’s a resource that specifically lists those actions that impact colleges and universities work with international students, scholars, and faculty. (Thanks SF)\n\nhttps://www.nafsa.org/executive-and-regulatory-actions-trump2admin\n\n\n\n\nWhy might higher education be under\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/opinion/andreessen-musk-trump-silicon-valley.html?unlocked_article_code=1.404.W7Cu.Mm09erVCtF7P&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThomas Edsall quotes Marc Andreessen\n\nno way to fix American higher education without replacement, and there is no way to replace them without letting them fail. And in a sense, this is the most obvious conclusion of all time. What happens in the business world when a company does a bad job? It fails and another company takes its place. That’s how you get progress. Below this is the process of evolution.\n\nHe goes on to quote Gil Duran on “tech oligarchs”\n\nare an existential threat to democracy. Look at the news. It makes no sense that a presidential administration would seek to crash the economy while allowing an unelected foreign-born billionaire to rip apart the government. This goes against every rule in politics. Trump’s poll numbers are sinking yet he’s taking no steps to correct the course. This is the logic of a suicide bomber.\n\n\nEducation is a right (By Maya Wiley)\n\nhttps://msmagazine.com/2025/03/19/education-cuts-trump-project-2025-public-schools/\n\nThe Trump administration’s war on public education is a war on our kids.\n\n\nTrump’s backing comes from a minority of radical ideologues who want a very different America—one that is significantly less diverse, less rich in rights, more indoctrinated to their extremist version of Christianity, steeped in a history of white-ethno-Christian nationalism. The authors want an unraveling of a system that has been partially, though not completely, transformed by the civil rights movement. The end game is clear: Charter schools, religious schools and private schools will benefit from a much greater share of public education dollars with less accountability.

That idea has found quite wide use)\n\nNow the Heritage contingent was in Israel, in part, to discuss another contentious policy paper: Project Esther, the foundation’s proposal to rapidly dismantle the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States, along with its support at schools and universities, at progressive organizations and in Congress.\n\n\nDrafted in the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel in 2023 and the mounting protests against the war in Gaza, Project Esther outlined an ambitious plan to fight antisemitism by branding a broad range of critics of Israel as “effectively a terrorist support network,” so that they could be deported, defunded, sued, fired, expelled, ostracized and otherwise excluded from what it considered “open society.”\n\n\nProject Esther’s architects envisioned outcomes that at the time might have seemed far-fetched. Curriculum it believed to be sympathetic to a “Hamas support” narrative would be taken out of schools and universities, and “supporting faculty” would be removed. Social media would be purged of content deemed to be antisemitic. Institutions would lose public funding. Foreign students who pushed for Palestinian rights would have their visas revoked, or be deported.\n\n\nHeritage national security director who coauthored Project Esther, said it was “no coincidence that we called for a series of actions to take place privately and publicly, and they are now happening.”\n\n\nBut Project Esther aims to go further, equating actions such as participating in pro-Palestinian campus protests with providing “material support” for terrorism, a broad legal construct that can lead to prison time, deportations, civil penalties and other serious consequences.\n\n\n“Project Esther changed the paradigm by associating anyone who opposes Israeli policies with the ‘Hamas Support Network,’”\n\n\nSome evangelical Christians have increasingly aligned themselves with conservative political forces in Israel, supporting their claims of biblical dominion over contested Palestinian territories. Many feel a kinship with Israel because of shared religious heritage. But some also believe that supporting Israel will hasten biblical end times, or advance Christianity’s global influence.\n\n\nThe Visionary of Trump 2.0 - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/russell-vought-trump-doge/682821/\n(Russel Vought takes over for Elon Musk in efforts to kill this federal government.

At the same time, public and private research universities, which depend heavily on international students’ tuition and labor—especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines—are facing the erosion of a vital economic pillar. These developments threaten not only the foundational rights of free speech and academic freedom but also the financial stability of the institutions that anchor the U.S. higher education system and conduct the vital research on which the future will be built.\n\n\nFar from isolated incidents, these cases reflect an emerging strategy—leveraging immigration enforcement as a tool of political suppression. International students have become an ideal scapegoat: politically vulnerable, culturally diverse, and often outspoken. Immigration officials now claim broad authority to revoke visas for “supporting terrorism,” using vague, expansive definitions. The result is a chilling effect on campus expression and a stark warning to those who would protest U.S. policy.\n\n\nFor academic leaders like Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, the strategy is transparent. “They want to undermine higher education and also heighten the new Cold War on campus,” Wolfson said.\n\nIs the University Of Austin Betraying Its Founding Principles?\nhttps://quillette.com/2025/05/16/is-the-university-of-austin-betraying-its-founding-principles/\n\nSkilled immigration on the chopping block? Effects of eliminating “Optional Practical Training” in the US | PIIE\n\nhttps://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/skilled-immigration-chopping-block-effects-eliminating-optional\n\nThat may soon change. The US administration is under pressure to constrict or eliminate the largest single pipeline into lawful immigration for high-skilled, university-educated workers. This pipeline is called Optional Practical Training (OPT)—a temporary work permit given to some foreign graduates of US universities.\n\n\nOptional Practical Training is a federal program that allows most international students at US universities the choice to work in the United States for a limited period after they graduate. About 72 percent of foreign graduates use OPT. The permit generally lasts one year but extends to three years for graduates at any educational level in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is a work permit attached to the student visa, a bridge between university enrollment and the workforce, granted under regulations starting in 1947.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nThis [expecting a renaissance of rich controversies], of course, is politically naïve. As the historian of science Michael Hagner predicted in 2019, the commitment of right-wing populists to epistemic pluralism only lasts until they manage to establish their own views well enough to eliminate all other points of view. Consider book bans, grant cancellations, and the violation of the First Amendment rights of foreign students and faculty and you will find validated Hagner’s cynical perspective on the authoritarian promotion of viewpoint diversity.\n\n\nBoth Harding and Haidt put their fingers on a very real problem: Our collective thinking benefits from looking at any given issue from multiple angles. For all sorts of historical reasons, colleges often do not represent a spectrum that is broad enough.\n\n\nThis balancing act requires what Aristotle called phronesis, the capacity for good judgment, and it cannot be formalized through viewpoint-diversity audits and affirmative-action policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Comey questioning, the Trump administration again targets speech\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/17/trump-freedom-of-speech-critics/\n(Just 4 numbers is enough now…)\n\nCollege newspapers under pressure as immigration fears silence sources\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/17/college-newspapers-trump-international-students/\n\nFree speech is dead at the American university.

I think, from my vantage point, one of the greatest concerns is seeing students, and particularly international students, being, basically, taken away on what appears to be the basis of viewpoints and opinions that they might have shared, either in the form of protest or, in one case, an op-ed. That really flies in the face of exactly what the First Amendment is supposed to protect against, especially in a public institution, which is that it’s supposed to be a restraint on government.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Times Sq.

White of the Northern District of California, who was appointed to the court by President George W. Bush, granted a temporary injunction protecting international students who were among the thousands whose visas were revoked earlier this year without clear justification, writing that government officials had “uniformly wreaked havoc” and “likely exceeded their authority and acted arbitrarily and capriciously” by the mass revocation of students’ immigration status.\n\n\nJudge White’s ruling said that the order applied to all “similarly situated individuals” who participate in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which is the system governing student visas. In the order, he expressed suspicion that the Trump administration was trying to place future visa “terminations beyond judicial review.”\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Has Cut Science Funding to Its Lowest Level in Decades\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/22/upshot/nsf-grants-trump-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(With a great graphic.

In particular, we are concerned about the damaging proposed changes to student aid programs, including eligibility changes that will prevent many low-income students from accessing Pell Grants; the availability of federal student loans for graduate students; new and increased taxes imposed on our institutions of higher education; and significant cuts to other programs supporting millions of postsecondary students nationwide.\n\n\nNYTimes: Republicans Harness Tax Code to Punish Trump’s Political Nemeses\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/republicans-taxes-trump-opponents.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe legislation, which could change as it heads to the Senate, would raise taxes on universities like Harvard, as well as on immigrants and on companies based in countries with taxes that the Trump administration deems unfair.\n\n\n“If you’re an ideological friend of Trump, you’re in generally good shape,” said William Gale, a co-director of the Tax Policy Center, a think tank. “If you’re an ideological foe, you pay more.” The increases, he added, “feel very punitive.”\n\n\nWhile the tax [investment returns generated by their endowments] would represent a huge new cost for Harvard and other affected schools, it would raise less than $7 billion in government revenue over 10 years — a pittance compared with the trillions in tax cuts otherwise included in the bill.\n\n\n\n\nNSF terminates huge number of grants and stops awarding new ones\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01513-1\n(A podcast.

Brandon Jones, president of the American Geophysical Union: Scientific societies — professional organizations that represent researchers in specific fields — have a long history of stepping in when politics interferes with research. After the Trump administration suspended work in April on the U.S. government’s flagship report on the impacts of climate change, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society partnered with plans to publish some of the research so the public can still access the findings.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a mini N.I.H. Andrew Marks, professor of physiology at Columbia University: We need a new funding model for science research. I propose the creation of the American Research Collaborative, a kind of mini-National Institutes of Health that could provide funding for universities. The A.R.C. would be led by a governing board elected by member organizations like the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Universities could opt in, and the collaborative’s tax-exempt status would attract private donors. a\n\n\n\n\nBuild new alliances. Dr. Jane Lubchenco, co-founder of United by Nature: In January, over 100 scientists outside the federal government were struggling to come to grips with the administration’s cancellation of years of work on what would have been the first ever federal assessment of nature.

Fear, particularly about the future of financial aid and immigration crackdowns, is pervasive.\n\n\nBut the college [Delta] is also planning for contingencies. “If somehow the government is going to withhold federal financial-aid dollars going to students based on something,” Gavin said, “then that will be where we have to change.”\n\n\nDavid Tandberg, president of Adams State University, said he has tried to sort the administration’s actions into several buckets based on whether they would have a direct impact on his campus — a public regional institution in rural, southern Colorado — and whether they’re probably just rhetoric. “We’re seeing all of those, and it takes a lot to sort through them,” Tandberg said. “The first month it was coming like a fire hose.”\n\n\nSimilar to Delta College, an urgent concern for a university like Adams State is whether federal cuts could slow or stop the flow of student financial aid,\n\n\n\n\n\nAt universities from the Ivy League to state schools, a financial reckoning has started as President Trump’s funding cuts hit home\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/university-spending-cuts-layoffs-pay-budget-trump-9f261d14?st=ErRuU9&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nNYTimes: Republican Plan to Tax Elite Colleges Could Hit in Unexpected Places\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/universities-endowment-tax-republicans.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe goal of the proposal, laid out in a report last week from Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, is to hold accountable “woke, elite universities that operate more like major corporations.” McPherson [small school that accepts the vast majority of its applicants] could be on the list because it has an endowment of $1.6 billion, thanks to an anonymous donation a few years ago.\n\n(Don’t cry for McPherson, cry that this stealing from the rich to give to the richer is even being proposed.)\n\nChinese College Gives Harvard International Students ‘Unconditional Offers’ - Newsweek\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/harvard-hkust-china-college-international-students-offer-2076257\n\n\n\n\nHow I Lost Faith in My University’s Mission\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/05/19/how-i-lost-faith-my-universitys-mission-opinion\n(Look at all the interventions from outside that have happened at the University of Utah)\n\nthe State Legislature passed an anti-DEI bill, prohibiting, among other things, offices and programs related to diversity, equity or inclusion. Administrators were required to purge these three words from university websites and other documents, such as RPT—retention, promotion and tenure review—guidelines, and the university administration interpreted the law as requiring that the Women’s Resource Center, the Black Cultural Center and the LGBT Resource Center be shuttered.\n\n\nThe state has also imposed a “bathroom bill” requiring trans university students to use locker rooms aligning with their sex assigned at birth, has banned Pride flags in public spaces (and in faculty offices if they can be seen through a window), and now requires faculty to post their syllabi in a publicly searchable database. It also prohibits university presidents from taking a stand on any issue that does not bear upon the “mission, role or pedagogical objectives” of the institution. And finally, as the coup de grâce for academic freedom and faculty expertise, it has funded and established the Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that all students take general education courses on the topics of Western civilization and the rise of Christianity. The law establishing the center identifies it as a pilot program to be rolled out to other Utah universities in the future.\n\n\nRecently passed laws dictate the process by which all post-tenure reviews of faculty must be conducted, curtail shared governance and cut state funds to all Utah public institutions by 10 percent ($60.5 million). Universities can have the funds “reallocated” if they use them for high-demand, high-wage majors. As a result, we lost our History and Philosophy of Science major, which drew some of our best students, many of them double majoring in STEM subjects and working toward careers in medicine and public health.\n\n\n\n\n\nReviewing Course Evaluations: The Drinking Game - McSweeney’s Internet Tendency\n\nhttps://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/reviewing-course-evaluations-the-drinking-game\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

    "text": "NYTimes: The Group Behind Project 2025 Has a Plan to Crush the Pro-Palestinian Movement\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/us/project-esther-heritage-foundation-palestine.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(This article discusses the engineered backlash against protesters by the Heritage Foundation using federal funding as the cudgel. That idea has found quite wide use)\n\nNow the Heritage contingent was in Israel, in part, to discuss another contentious policy paper: Project Esther, the foundation’s proposal to rapidly dismantle the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States, along with its support at schools and universities, at progressive organizations and in Congress.\n\n\nDrafted in the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel in 2023 and the mounting protests against the war in Gaza, Project Esther outlined an ambitious plan to fight antisemitism by branding a broad range of critics of Israel as “effectively a terrorist support network,” so that they could be deported, defunded, sued, fired, expelled, ostracized and otherwise excluded from what it considered “open society.”\n\n\nProject Esther’s architects envisioned outcomes that at the time might have seemed far-fetched. Curriculum it believed to be sympathetic to a “Hamas support” narrative would be taken out of schools and universities, and “supporting faculty” would be removed. Social media would be purged of content deemed to be antisemitic. Institutions would lose public funding. Foreign students who pushed for Palestinian rights would have their visas revoked, or be deported.\n\n\nHeritage national security director who coauthored Project Esther, said it was “no coincidence that we called for a series of actions to take place privately and publicly, and they are now happening.”\n\n\nBut Project Esther aims to go further, equating actions such as participating in pro-Palestinian campus protests with providing “material support” for terrorism, a broad legal construct that can lead to prison time, deportations, civil penalties and other serious consequences.\n\n\n“Project Esther changed the paradigm by associating anyone who opposes Israeli policies with the ‘Hamas Support Network,’”\n\n\nSome evangelical Christians have increasingly aligned themselves with conservative political forces in Israel, supporting their claims of biblical dominion over contested Palestinian territories. Many feel a kinship with Israel because of shared religious heritage. But some also believe that supporting Israel will hasten biblical end times, or advance Christianity’s global influence.\n\n\nThe Visionary of Trump 2.0 - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/russell-vought-trump-doge/682821/\n(Russel Vought takes over for Elon Musk in efforts to kill this federal government. But he is more patient and will have a longer impact)\nOne example is “https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-quietly-kills-rule-to-shield-americans-from-data-brokers/\n\nTrump’s Attacks on International Students Are the Start of a Wider War | The New Republic\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/195142/trump-war-international-students-university\n\nIn recent months, foreign students—particularly those participating in pro-Palestine protests—have had their student visas threatened or have been detained and placed in deportation proceedings, signaling a sharp and politically charged shift in federal policy. At the same time, public and private research universities, which depend heavily on international students’ tuition and labor—especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines—are facing the erosion of a vital economic pillar. These developments threaten not only the foundational rights of free speech and academic freedom but also the financial stability of the institutions that anchor the U.S. higher education system and conduct the vital research on which the future will be built.\n\n\nFar from isolated incidents, these cases reflect an emerging strategy—leveraging immigration enforcement as a tool of political suppression. International students have become an ideal scapegoat: politically vulnerable, culturally diverse, and often outspoken. Immigration officials now claim broad authority to revoke visas for “supporting terrorism,” using vague, expansive definitions. The result is a chilling effect on campus expression and a stark warning to those who would protest U.S. policy.\n\n\nFor academic leaders like Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, the strategy is transparent. “They want to undermine higher education and also heighten the new Cold War on campus,” Wolfson said.\n\nIs the University Of Austin Betraying Its Founding Principles?\nhttps://quillette.com/2025/05/16/is-the-university-of-austin-betraying-its-founding-principles/\n\nSkilled immigration on the chopping block? Effects of eliminating “Optional Practical Training” in the US | PIIE\n\nhttps://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/skilled-immigration-chopping-block-effects-eliminating-optional\n\nThat may soon change. The US administration is under pressure to constrict or eliminate the largest single pipeline into lawful immigration for high-skilled, university-educated workers. This pipeline is called Optional Practical Training (OPT)—a temporary work permit given to some foreign graduates of US universities.\n\n\nOptional Practical Training is a federal program that allows most international students at US universities the choice to work in the United States for a limited period after they graduate. About 72 percent of foreign graduates use OPT. The permit generally lasts one year but extends to three years for graduates at any educational level in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is a work permit attached to the student visa, a bridge between university enrollment and the workforce, granted under regulations starting in 1947.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nThis [expecting a renaissance of rich controversies], of course, is politically naïve. As the historian of science Michael Hagner predicted in 2019, the commitment of right-wing populists to epistemic pluralism only lasts until they manage to establish their own views well enough to eliminate all other points of view. Consider book bans, grant cancellations, and the violation of the First Amendment rights of foreign students and faculty and you will find validated Hagner’s cynical perspective on the authoritarian promotion of viewpoint diversity.\n\n\nBoth Harding and Haidt put their fingers on a very real problem: Our collective thinking benefits from looking at any given issue from multiple angles. For all sorts of historical reasons, colleges often do not represent a spectrum that is broad enough.\n\n\nThis balancing act requires what Aristotle called phronesis, the capacity for good judgment, and it cannot be formalized through viewpoint-diversity audits and affirmative-action policies.",

Cuts to Medicaid and other programs\n\n\nNYTimes: On Education, DeSantis’s Florida Paved the Way for Trump’s America\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/us/education-desantis-florida-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n“Far be it for President Trump to be so foolish as to ignore a good idea,” said Tiffany Justice, a founder of Moms for Liberty, the right-wing parental-rights group that was key in shaping Mr. DeSantis’s agenda in Florida.\n\n(In one sentence, the actions of a president, governor, and fringe group head are sanewashed.)\n\nNYTimes: 13 Ways to Save Health and Science\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/19/opinion/save-health-science-climate.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\nLean on other scientists. Brandon Jones, president of the American Geophysical Union: Scientific societies — professional organizations that represent researchers in specific fields — have a long history of stepping in when politics interferes with research. After the Trump administration suspended work in April on the U.S. government’s flagship report on the impacts of climate change, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society partnered with plans to publish some of the research so the public can still access the findings.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a mini N.I.H. Andrew Marks, professor of physiology at Columbia University: We need a new funding model for science research. I propose the creation of the American Research Collaborative, a kind of mini-National Institutes of Health that could provide funding for universities. The A.R.C. would be led by a governing board elected by member organizations like the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Universities could opt in, and the collaborative’s tax-exempt status would attract private donors. a\n\n\n\n\nBuild new alliances. Dr. Jane Lubchenco, co-founder of United by Nature: In January, over 100 scientists outside the federal government were struggling to come to grips with the administration’s cancellation of years of work on what would have been the first ever federal assessment of nature. We refused to quit. So we created a new path to deliver the report and show why the information matters. The initiative, called United by Nature, will have a governing body, advisers and partners, independent peer review and extensive public engagement.\n\n\n\nNYTimes: The President Will Destroy You Now\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/opinion/trump-musk-doge-government.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe war on academic research will have long-lasting implications for technical innovation in America. Scientists who cannot support their labs while President Trump holds their funds hostage for the sake of MAGA theater over the next four years will take their labs elsewhere.\n\n\nChina will be a winner in this. Uncertainty about government commitments will make it harder for investors to take basic and applied research in universities and move it to market. The longer the time horizon for investments, the more trust and stability matter. In the end, disrupters like Trump and Musk leave us with a much bigger legacy of doubt and uncertainty than achievement.\n\n\nMost Colleges Aren’t a Target of Trump (Yet). Here’s How Their Presidents Are Leading.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/most-colleges-arent-a-target-of-trump-yet-heres-how-their-presidents-are-leading\n\nStill, campus leaders at community colleges and four-year public regional and private institutions — representing the vast majority of higher ed — say they do see impacts of Trump’s policies. Fear, particularly about the future of financial aid and immigration crackdowns, is pervasive.\n\n\nBut the college [Delta] is also planning for contingencies. “If somehow the government is going to withhold federal financial-aid dollars going to students based on something,” Gavin said, “then that will be where we have to change.”\n\n\nDavid Tandberg, president of Adams State University, said he has tried to sort the administration’s actions into several buckets based on whether they would have a direct impact on his campus — a public regional institution in rural, southern Colorado — and whether they’re probably just rhetoric. “We’re seeing all of those, and it takes a lot to sort through them,” Tandberg said. “The first month it was coming like a fire hose.”\n\n\nSimilar to Delta College, an urgent concern for a university like Adams State is whether federal cuts could slow or stop the flow of student financial aid,",

Administrators were required to purge these three words from university websites and other documents, such as RPT—retention, promotion and tenure review—guidelines, and the university administration interpreted the law as requiring that the Women’s Resource Center, the Black Cultural Center and the LGBT Resource Center be shuttered.\n\n\nThe state has also imposed a “bathroom bill” requiring trans university students to use locker rooms aligning with their sex assigned at birth, has banned Pride flags in public spaces (and in faculty offices if they can be seen through a window), and now requires faculty to post their syllabi in a publicly searchable database. It also prohibits university presidents from taking a stand on any issue that does not bear upon the “mission, role or pedagogical objectives” of the institution. And finally, as the coup de grâce for academic freedom and faculty expertise, it has funded and established the Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that all students take general education courses on the topics of Western civilization and the rise of Christianity. The law establishing the center identifies it as a pilot program to be rolled out to other Utah universities in the future.\n\n\nRecently passed laws dictate the process by which all post-tenure reviews of faculty must be conducted, curtail shared governance and cut state funds to all Utah public institutions by 10 percent ($60.5 million). Universities can have the funds “reallocated” if they use them for high-demand, high-wage majors. As a result, we lost our History and Philosophy of Science major, which drew some of our best students, many of them double majoring in STEM subjects and working toward careers in medicine and public health.",

The administration has paused $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania amid an investigation into its athletics policies. And it temporarily paused more than $100 million in funding to the University of Maine system after the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, said she would not observe the president’s executive order on transgender athletes, which does not carry the force of law.\n\n\nNYTimes: Professors Pushed Harvard to Resist Trump.

On the first full day of the Trump presidency, the university announced it was adopting a highly debated definition of antisemitism — which labels certain criticisms of Israel, such as calling its existence racist, as antisemitic — a move encouraged by the new administration but slammed by free speech advocates.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Pauses Dozens of Federal Grants to Princeton\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/trump-federal-grants-princeton.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration moved this week to suspend dozens of federal grants to Princeton University, the fourth Ivy League school that has seen its financial support from Washington reduced or explicitly threatened since March.\n\n\nAccording to Princeton’s most recent financial report, the university received more than $455 million through government grants and contracts during the fiscal year that ended in June 2024. That money accounted for roughly 18 percent of the university’s revenues.\n\n\nWho Is on Trump’s Antisemitism Task Force?\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/02/who-trumps-antisemitism-task-force?utm_source=Inside+Higher+Ed&utm_campaign=d776e1ff03-DNU_2021_COPY_02&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1fcbc04421-d776e1ff03-197464749&mc_cid=d776e1ff03&mc_eid=50634a26f0\n\nStaff and Funding Cuts at the NEH Loom\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/03/staff-and-funding-cuts-neh-loom\n\nHumanities advocates don’t know exactly how large the cuts to NEH’s approximately 180-person staff or $78.25 million grant budget will be, but they note that “patterns at other agencies” provide a solid hint.

The administration has paused $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania amid an investigation into its athletics policies. And it temporarily paused more than $100 million in funding to the University of Maine system after the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, said she would not observe the president’s executive order on transgender athletes, which does not carry the force of law.\n\n\nNYTimes: Professors Pushed Harvard to Resist Trump. Now Billions Are on the Line.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/republicans-harvard-funding.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(NY Times blaming the victims in the headline…again)\n\n“The sharks circle when they smell blood in the water,” said Kenneth Roth, a former director of Human Rights Watch and a fellow at Harvard, who wants Harvard to fight better to allow robust debate and academic freedom.\n\n\n“That every-man-for-themselves response is about to cost us our democracy,” said Dr. Levitsky, who studies authoritarian regimes.\n\n\nAs President Trump’s inauguration approached, Harvard hired Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with deep ties to Mr. Trump. On the first full day of the Trump presidency, the university announced it was adopting a highly debated definition of antisemitism — which labels certain criticisms of Israel, such as calling its existence racist, as antisemitic — a move encouraged by the new administration but slammed by free speech advocates.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Pauses Dozens of Federal Grants to Princeton\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/trump-federal-grants-princeton.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration moved this week to suspend dozens of federal grants to Princeton University, the fourth Ivy League school that has seen its financial support from Washington reduced or explicitly threatened since March.\n\n\nAccording to Princeton’s most recent financial report, the university received more than $455 million through government grants and contracts during the fiscal year that ended in June 2024.

The N.I.H. — the largest public funder of biomedical and behavioral research in the world — announced it would slash funding to universities for overhead, or indirect, costs, which often covers laboratories’ operational needs. …The agency has lost nearly one-fourth of its 18,000 employees because of job cuts, buyouts and some employees’ choosing early retirement, according to reporting by NPR.\n\n\nNYTimes: I Led Harvard’s Medical School, and I Fear for What’s to Come\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/opinion/harvard-medicine-higher-education.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Sends Harvard a List of Demands to Protect Federal Funds\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/trump-harvard-funding-demands.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn both instances, the government asked Harvard and Columbia to impose bans, with few exemptions, on masking.\n\n\nThe Trump administration also pressured the universities to intensify efforts to hold student groups “accountable,” cease admissions practices based on race, color or national origin and revamp policies on campus protests.\n\n\nit said that Harvard’s “programs and departments that fuel antisemitic harassment must be reviewed and necessary changes made to address bias, improve viewpoint diversity, and end ideological capture.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Set to Pause $510 Million for Brown University\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/trump-administration-brown-university-funding-pause.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThis adds Brown to the list that includes now: Columbia, Princeton, Harvard, UPenn",

The real reasons, I think, are anti-intellectualism and greed, and the fact that Trump is building a mafia state.\n\n\nNow, a mafia state is an absolutely centralized system in which one person, the patron, the don, distributes money and power. And so in order to build a mafia state, such an aspiring patron needs to strip other agents of their money and power.\n\n\nAnd it has the ability to, if not bankrupt universities — it certainly has the ability to bankrupt universities that don’t have significant endowments, which is most of them.\n\n\nThe only way for universities to really address this is to come to terms with the fact that there is no way for them, with this administration, to keep their federal money.\n\n\nFor more on the steps the administration has signaled it might do to gain obesiance, this AAUP white paper from 2024 offers much insight (shared by VC):\n\nhttps://www.aaup.org/file/Manufacturing_Backlash_final_1.pdf\n\nwe have witnessed what one scholar correctly called an “unusually brazen series of challenges to academic freedom,” unleashed by conservative activists and a “national-level political machine” … to undermine academic freedom and university autonomy.\n\nIncluding academic gag orders seeking to ban the teaching of “critical race theory” (CRT); shuttering academic programs; dismantling institutional efforts to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion; weaken tenure protections for faculty; undermined the accreditation process; establish academic programs, centers, and whole schools designed to teach conservative content;\n\nAs this white paper demonstrates, however, this legislation is largely the outgrowth of efforts by right-wing and libertarian think tanks, working closely with Republican politicians, to manufacture a culture-war backlash against educators and academic institutions … as part of a well-organized and well-funded backlash that seeks to roll back the political, social, and cultural gains made in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement increased queer and trans visibility.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Insatiable\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/trump-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n&lt; In order to function effectively, Democracies depend on the ability of the electorate to make what Jackson calls “informed choices.” In this context, Jackson writes, “Knowledge institutions — including universities, the truth-oriented press, government offices with data collection or scientific responsibilities — are crucial for constitutional democracies.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s DOJ Claims Academic Journals Hold “Partisan” Stance in Scientific Debates – Mother Jones\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/04/trump-doj-academic-journals-scientific-debates-chest-journal/\n\nThe publisher of CHEST, a prestigious, peer-reviewed medical journal focused on respiratory health, received a letter from the Trump administration seeking information about how its editors handle scientific controversies and “competing viewpoints.” Some medical professionals see the missive as an attempt to stifle academic freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-DEI Guidance Letter Put On Hold, for Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/24/education-departments-anti-dei-guidance-blocked\n\nFederal judges in New Hampshire and Maryland handed down the rulings after finding plaintiffs in the two separate lawsuits were likely to succeed in proving that the Feb. 14 Dear Colleague letter violated procedural standards and the First Amendment. Prior to the orders, colleges and K-12 schools that failed to comply with the letter risked their federal funding\n\n\n“Although the 2025 letter does not make clear what exactly it prohibits, it makes at least one thing clear: schools should not come close to anything that could be considered ‘DEI,’ lest they be deemed to have guessed wrong,” the New Hampshire judge wrote. And since loss of federal grants could cripple institutions, “it is predictable—if not obvious—that [they] will eliminate all vestiges of DEI to avoid even the possibility of funding termination,” regardless of whether it is an example of executive overreach.\n\n\n\n\n\nMahmoud Khalil: What does my detention by ICE say about America?\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4czL2dT\n\nDetained Tufts student must be transferred to Vermont, judge rules\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/04/19/judge-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-vermont-ice/\n\nFearing Trump’s Visa Crackdown, College Students Race to Scrub Op-Eds - WSJ\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-student-visas-newspaper-op-eds-61595294\n\n\n\n\nWeekly NIH Funding Opportunities and Notices for April 18, 2025\n\n\n(none)\n\n(Thanks MP)\n\nUpdates on NSF Priorities | NSF - National Science Foundation\n\nhttps://www.nsf.gov/updates-on-priorities\n\nResearch projects with more narrow impact limited to subgroups of people based on protected class or characteristics do not effectuate NSF priorities.\n\n\n\nWhat types of awards are being terminated?

She received no official explanation for why the grant was being terminated more than a year ahead of its scheduled end. But Dr. Fiesler speculated that it had something to do with the word “misinformation” in the award’s abstract.\n\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the N.S.F. said that its grant cancellations were not in violation of the temporary restraining order. When asked by The Times to provide clarification on the legality of the grant cancellations, the agency declined to comment.\n\n\nLast Thursday, the magazine Nature reported that all new research grants by the agency had been frozen, as ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The N.S.F. declined to confirm the freezing of new awards or what role, if any, DOGE had in the action.\n\n\nNSF Director Resigns\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/25/nsf-director-panchanathan-resigns\n\nHis resignation comes less than one week after he issued sweeping priority changes—including terminating funding for projects that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion or combating misinformation—at the independent agency that funds billions of dollars to nonmedical university research each year.\n\n\n“I believe that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency and feel that it is time to pass the baton to new leadership,” Panchanathan wrote in a resignation letter, first reported by Science. “I am deeply grateful to the presidents for the opportunity to serve our nation.”\n\n\nUnder Panchanathan’s leadership, the NSF’s stated priorities have included increasing diversity in the STEM workforce, forming industry partnerships, job creation and broadening research opportunities for smaller universities and community colleges.\n\n\nTrump is destroying 100 years of competitive advantage in 100 days\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/25/us-losing-competitive-edge-science/\n\nAll three of these forces are now being reversed. The Trump administration is at war with the country’s leading universities, threatening them with hostile takeovers and withholding billions of dollars in research funding. America’s crown jewels of science, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, are being gutted.\n\n\nCUNY’s Research on Vaccine Misinformation Halted by Trump Administration | THE CITY — NYC News\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/04/24/cuny-layoffs-vaccine-research-funding-cuts-misinformation-trump/\n\nBut a day later, on March 11, the NIH terminated a $3.3 million project led by Nash [CUNY faculty member who provided sage advice and was widely cited during the pandemic] that studied whether or not brief digital messages could increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake among adults with mental health issues like anxiety and depression.\n\n\n“We’re looking at letting people go, furloughing them, people losing their health insurance and people losing their opportunity to do the kind of work that they signed up to do,” Nash said.\n\n\n“We’re doing our best to see them through, if they’re finishing their degree with us this year, getting them through to the end,” he added. “Our dean has also offered to try and help where he can. But CUNY is not a university with deep pockets. We don’t have an endowment that we can draw on for these kinds of things.”\n\nIn the Chancellor’s “Stand Together” email we have:\n\nWe are evaluating how changes to funding from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy and other federal agencies will impact our research and programming. Cuts in NIH reimbursements, for example, for operational costs of research and training are being challenged in court, but should they be carried out we estimate that CUNY would receive only about 35% of our expected $12.7 million payment on currently active grants. In addition, 61 CUNY research projects have been subject to stop-work orders from federal agencies.\n\n\nFlorida’s Own DOGE Reviews Faculty Research, Grants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/04/25/floridas-own-doge-reviewing-faculty-research-grants\n\nEarlier this month, the Florida DOGE asked public college and university presidents to provide an account—by the end of last week—of “all research published by staff” over the last six years, including “Papers and drafts made available to the public or in online academic repositories for drafts, preprints, or similar materials.”\n\n\n“If not contained therein, author’s name, title, and position at the institution” must be provided, according to the letters the presidents received. The letters didn’t say what this and other requests were for.\n\n\nThe Florida DOGE also requested information on all grants awarded to institutions over the last six years, asking for each institution’s policy on allocating grants “for purposes of indirect cost recovery, including procedures for calculation.” Further, it requested an account of “all filled and vacant positions held by any employee with a non-instructional role.”\n\n\nBy the end of April, Florida’s public institutions must also provide the “Length of research associated” with each research publication, funding sources associated with the research and any “publications about the research” from the researcher or institution. In addition, the state DOGE is requesting funding sources for each institution’s noninstructional positions and the names of the nonstudent employees administering the grants.\n\n\nAnd that may not be the end of the DOGE demands…\n\n\n\n\n\n“Trump to Sign Executive Order Targeting University Accreditors”\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-accreditors-executive-order-universities-4e4366cc?mod=djemalertNEWS\n(Thanks to DAM for this link).\n\n“Revoking accreditation is an existential threat for these universities,” said Andrew Gillen, a research fellow at the Cato Institute. “If you lose Pell grants and lose student loans, for most colleges that means you’re done.”\n\n\nSome conservatives have called for stronger changes to the watchdog function of higher education, including proposals to make schools accountable for the federal loans their students take out. Right now, schools aren’t penalized if graduates default on loans.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Signs Executive Order Targeting College Accreditors\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/us/politics/trump-executive-order-university-accreditors.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Along with many others which will prove equally troubling if found legal)\n\n“The federal government has long stayed away from any involvement in a college’s curriculum or hiring, and current law prohibits this kind of intrusion into academic affairs,” Mr. Shireman [a senior fellow at the Century Foundation] said, adding that the executive order “steps far across this line.”\n\n\nMr. Trump also signed executive orders to encourage the use of artificial intelligence in schools, promote private-sector partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities, and increase the number of apprenticeships in skilled trade jobs. Another order instructed his administration to make it more difficult for universities to obscure details of foreign funding.\n\n\nTwo other orders focused on student discipline, which has been a political flashpoint for the past decade.\n\n\nOne order was to ensure that disciplinary policies were not based on D.E.I. policies. Another restricts the use of the so-called disparate impact rule, which civil rights groups have long said is an important tool for showing discrimination against minorities.\n\n\nTrump orders changes to civil rights rules, college accreditation\n\nhttps://wapo.st/42L5uEa\n\nThe EO\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/reforming-accreditation-to-strengthen-higher-education/\n\nAccreditors Sound Off on Executive Order\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/25/accreditors-sound-executive-order\n\nMiddle States issues and Advocacy Alert\n\nhttps://www.msche.org/2025/04/23/advocacy-alert-executive-order-regarding-accreditation/\n\n– The Order directs the Secretary of Education to hold higher education “accreditors” accountable, including through denial, monitoring, suspension, or termination of accreditation recognition, for accreditors’ poor performance or violations of federal civil rights law.\n\n(One might reasonably see this as groundwork to suspend existing accreditors and replace them with more administration friendly/industry unfriendly accreditors)\n\n– The Order mandates the Secretary of Education realign accreditation with student-focused principles by:\n\n\n– Prioritizing intellectual diversity among faculty in order to advance academic freedom, intellectual inquiry, and student learning.\n\n(Viewpoint diversity is perhaps better know as affirmative action for underrepresented political view points)\n\n\n\n\nEO on foreign monies\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/transparency-regarding-foreign-influence-at-american-universities/\n\nWith the U.S. cracking down on student loan payments, is college still worth it?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/25/student-loan-payments-collections-college-affordability/\nThis columnists answer: community college for the win\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s destructive war on academia\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/19/trump-harvard-irs-nixon-universities/\n\nPresident Donald Trump has launched a public blitzkrieg against Harvard. On Monday, he froze $2.2 billion in federal funding after the university rejected a far-reaching list of contradictory demands, including the hiring of an external auditor to evaluate the “viewpoint diversity” of its students, faculty, staff and leadership. On Wednesday, Treasury asked the IRS to consider revoking Harvard’s tax-exempt status. (Donations to the university could dry up if they’re not tax-deductible.) Next, the Department of Homeland Security threatened to revoke Harvard’s ability to host international students, who make up 27 percent of the student body. In the coming months, Trump and congressional allies hope to impose devastating taxes on university endowment funds — Vice President Vance has suggested as high as 35 percent — and plan to scrutinize their investments in China and clean energy.\n\n\nAcademic freedom is worth defending. In the long term, this might require colleges to reduce their dependence on federal dollars. In the short term, schools should stick together to resist Trump’s unlawful dictates on what they teach and whom they hire. It is heartening that Harvard’s defiance is already helping to stiffen the backbones of college administrators elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Cornell Cancels Kehlani Performance Over Her Stance on the War in Gaza\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/nyregion/kehlani-cornell-concert-replaced.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump and Vance fear universities for a reason\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4juE7ow\n\nPresident Trump has tested his authority with such force that other institutions—universities, law firms and many lawmakers—have started to fight back\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-authority-resistance-law-firms-universities-424632ae?st=ZS9Wx4&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nCan Colleges Survive Trump’s Cuts\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/can-colleges-survive-trumps-cuts\n\nThe cost of Trump’s proposals could exceed $100 million per year for dozens of institutions, according to analysis by the economist Phillip Levine. And yet the Trump administration has gone even further by withholding nearly all federal grant funding from some elite institutions. Columbia University tried to preserve $400 million in federal funding by agreeing to a list of onerous federal demands that get into the minutiae of academic governance, but even that has not satisfied the federal government.\n\n\nBlue-state public flagship universities are likely the next target, and even institutions that avoid such politicized attention are likely to suffer from structural cuts in federal grants and contracts. These cuts have happened so suddenly that some universities began to take action immediately in order to preserve cash flow, a key lesson from the pandemic. But this is also a longer-term financial issue as 45 months remain in the Trump administration, and there is no guarantee that federal funding returns to normal in 2029.\n\n(Of the 4 steps suggested, only “Conduct layoffs and hiring and spending freezes” appears applicable to CUNY.)\n\nTo this point, the federal government has promised that financial aid to students, the largest source of federal funding to most universities, will not be affected by cuts elsewhere in the Department of Education. But it is possible that the federal government tries to selectively pull federal financial-aid eligibility,\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Tried to Derail Our Work.

The project needed to continue. And so with encouragement from friends and mentors, my collaborators and I began reaching out — to potential partners, funders and publishers.\n\n\nWhat we found wasn’t just financial support. It was energy. It was courage. People understood the urgency and the opportunity. And together, we began to reimagine the work not just as a continuation of what had been cut short but also as something new and more alive. A rigorous, independent effort to tell the story of nature in America.\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s freeze on $2.2 billion to Harvard provided no proof of wrongdoing\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/17/harvard-trump-grant-freeze-antisemitism/\n\nNYTimes: Trump Officials Blame Mistake for Setting Off Confrontation With Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/business/trump-harvard-letter-mistake.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Sure…)\n\nHarvard pushes back on claim that Trump team mistakenly sent demand letter\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/19/harvard-trump-letter-mistake-unauthorized/\n\nNYTimes: In Trump Attack on Harvard, Punishment Before Proof\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/us/trump-harvard-legal-process.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration has grown so furious with Harvard that it is planning to pull an additional $1 billion of the school’s funding for health research\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-administration-irate-at-harvard-will-pull-additional-1-billion-in-funding-8c209113?st=54dT6c&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nThe government’s set of demands was mistakenly sent a day earlier than the task force intended, but its contents weren’t an error, people familiar with the task force said.

European universities are courting top American scientists and researchers en masse with offers of “academic asylum.” The European Research Council has doubled the funding it offers researchers to move to the continent to €2 million ($2.3 million). A bloc of 12 EU nations are working together to fast-track visas, Horizon Europe grants, and relocation stipends in an effort to poach U.S. brainpower in accordance with their own strategic priorities.\n\n(Scientists leaving Germany in 1939 was one of three reasons for the growth in US research accomplishments in the Zakaria op-ed https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/25/us-losing-competitive-edge-science/)\n\n\n\n\nWhite House Partners With Hillsdale for Lecture Series\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/25/white-house-partners-hillsdale-lecture-series\n\nThe Trump administration also worked with Hillsdale at the end of the president’s first term. In early 2017, Hillsdale officials were part of a commission, chaired by Arnn, that produced the 1776 Report, a widely ridiculed document that academics dismissed as unserious scholarship. Critics argued the 1776 Report provided a whitewashed view of American history, omitted Native Americans entirely and had multiple citation issues.\n\n\n(Hillsdale, a private, Christian institution in Michigan, does not accept federal financial aid.)\n\n\nComing to a theater near you…\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Texts Barnard Employees and Asks if They Are Jewish\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/nyregion/barnard-faculty-eeoc-text-jewish.html\n\nSerena Longley, Barnard’s general counsel, acknowledged in an email to the faculty members that Barnard had provided the commission with the personal contact information of staff members to give them the opportunity to participate. “Participation in the survey is voluntary,” she wrote.\n\n\nMany Jews say Trump is politicizing the fight against antisemitism\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/25/antisemitism-trump-jews-israel/\n\n“Antisemitism is real and it requires robust, constructive solutions,” said Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs. “What’s happening now, though, is exploiting the Jewish community’s legitimate and real concerns about antisemitism to undermine rule of law, due process, educational institutions and our democracy.”\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

The real reasons, I think, are anti-intellectualism and greed, and the fact that Trump is building a mafia state.\n\n\nNow, a mafia state is an absolutely centralized system in which one person, the patron, the don, distributes money and power. And so in order to build a mafia state, such an aspiring patron needs to strip other agents of their money and power.\n\n\nAnd it has the ability to, if not bankrupt universities — it certainly has the ability to bankrupt universities that don’t have significant endowments, which is most of them.\n\n\nThe only way for universities to really address this is to come to terms with the fact that there is no way for them, with this administration, to keep their federal money.\n\n\nFor more on the steps the administration has signaled it might do to gain obesiance, this AAUP white paper from 2024 offers much insight (shared by VC):\n\nhttps://www.aaup.org/file/Manufacturing_Backlash_final_1.pdf\n\nwe have witnessed what one scholar correctly called an “unusually brazen series of challenges to academic freedom,” unleashed by conservative activists and a “national-level political machine” … to undermine academic freedom and university autonomy.\n\nIncluding academic gag orders seeking to ban the teaching of “critical race theory” (CRT); shuttering academic programs; dismantling institutional efforts to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion; weaken tenure protections for faculty; undermined the accreditation process; establish academic programs, centers, and whole schools designed to teach conservative content;\n\nAs this white paper demonstrates, however, this legislation is largely the outgrowth of efforts by right-wing and libertarian think tanks, working closely with Republican politicians, to manufacture a culture-war backlash against educators and academic institutions … as part of a well-organized and well-funded backlash that seeks to roll back the political, social, and cultural gains made in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement increased queer and trans visibility.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Is Insatiable\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/opinion/trump-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n&lt; In order to function effectively, Democracies depend on the ability of the electorate to make what Jackson calls “informed choices.” In this context, Jackson writes, “Knowledge institutions — including universities, the truth-oriented press, government offices with data collection or scientific responsibilities — are crucial for constitutional democracies.”",

She received no official explanation for why the grant was being terminated more than a year ahead of its scheduled end. But Dr. Fiesler speculated that it had something to do with the word “misinformation” in the award’s abstract.\n\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the N.S.F. said that its grant cancellations were not in violation of the temporary restraining order. When asked by The Times to provide clarification on the legality of the grant cancellations, the agency declined to comment.\n\n\nLast Thursday, the magazine Nature reported that all new research grants by the agency had been frozen, as ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The N.S.F. declined to confirm the freezing of new awards or what role, if any, DOGE had in the action.\n\n\nNSF Director Resigns\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/25/nsf-director-panchanathan-resigns\n\nHis resignation comes less than one week after he issued sweeping priority changes—including terminating funding for projects that focus on diversity, equity and inclusion or combating misinformation—at the independent agency that funds billions of dollars to nonmedical university research each year.\n\n\n“I believe that I have done all I can to advance the mission of the agency and feel that it is time to pass the baton to new leadership,” Panchanathan wrote in a resignation letter, first reported by Science. “I am deeply grateful to the presidents for the opportunity to serve our nation.”\n\n\nUnder Panchanathan’s leadership, the NSF’s stated priorities have included increasing diversity in the STEM workforce, forming industry partnerships, job creation and broadening research opportunities for smaller universities and community colleges.\n\n\nTrump is destroying 100 years of competitive advantage in 100 days\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/04/25/us-losing-competitive-edge-science/\n\nAll three of these forces are now being reversed.

But CUNY is not a university with deep pockets. We don’t have an endowment that we can draw on for these kinds of things.”\n\nIn the Chancellor’s “Stand Together” email we have:\n\nWe are evaluating how changes to funding from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy and other federal agencies will impact our research and programming. Cuts in NIH reimbursements, for example, for operational costs of research and training are being challenged in court, but should they be carried out we estimate that CUNY would receive only about 35% of our expected $12.7 million payment on currently active grants.

The letters didn’t say what this and other requests were for.\n\n\nThe Florida DOGE also requested information on all grants awarded to institutions over the last six years, asking for each institution’s policy on allocating grants “for purposes of indirect cost recovery, including procedures for calculation.” Further, it requested an account of “all filled and vacant positions held by any employee with a non-instructional role.”\n\n\nBy the end of April, Florida’s public institutions must also provide the “Length of research associated” with each research publication, funding sources associated with the research and any “publications about the research” from the researcher or institution. In addition, the state DOGE is requesting funding sources for each institution’s noninstructional positions and the names of the nonstudent employees administering the grants.\n\n\nAnd that may not be the end of the DOGE demands…",

Another order instructed his administration to make it more difficult for universities to obscure details of foreign funding.\n\n\nTwo other orders focused on student discipline, which has been a political flashpoint for the past decade.\n\n\nOne order was to ensure that disciplinary policies were not based on D.E.I. policies.

On Monday, he froze $2.2 billion in federal funding after the university rejected a far-reaching list of contradictory demands, including the hiring of an external auditor to evaluate the “viewpoint diversity” of its students, faculty, staff and leadership. On Wednesday, Treasury asked the IRS to consider revoking Harvard’s tax-exempt status. (Donations to the university could dry up if they’re not tax-deductible.) Next, the Department of Homeland Security threatened to revoke Harvard’s ability to host international students, who make up 27 percent of the student body. In the coming months, Trump and congressional allies hope to impose devastating taxes on university endowment funds — Vice President Vance has suggested as high as 35 percent — and plan to scrutinize their investments in China and clean energy.\n\n\nAcademic freedom is worth defending. In the long term, this might require colleges to reduce their dependence on federal dollars. In the short term, schools should stick together to resist Trump’s unlawful dictates on what they teach and whom they hire. It is heartening that Harvard’s defiance is already helping to stiffen the backbones of college administrators elsewhere.",

And yet the Trump administration has gone even further by withholding nearly all federal grant funding from some elite institutions. Columbia University tried to preserve $400 million in federal funding by agreeing to a list of onerous federal demands that get into the minutiae of academic governance, but even that has not satisfied the federal government.\n\n\nBlue-state public flagship universities are likely the next target, and even institutions that avoid such politicized attention are likely to suffer from structural cuts in federal grants and contracts. These cuts have happened so suddenly that some universities began to take action immediately in order to preserve cash flow, a key lesson from the pandemic. But this is also a longer-term financial issue as 45 months remain in the Trump administration, and there is no guarantee that federal funding returns to normal in 2029.\n\n(Of the 4 steps suggested, only “Conduct layoffs and hiring and spending freezes” appears applicable to CUNY.)\n\nTo this point, the federal government has promised that financial aid to students, the largest source of federal funding to most universities, will not be affected by cuts elsewhere in the Department of Education.

We share all of the facts. We’re not trying to push propaganda. I’m not trying to sell a product. I’m just trying to share as many facts as possible in as much context as possible. And that’s something that you can do on Wikipedia that you can’t do on conventional social media.\n\n\nWe’re the No. 1 nonsense detectives on the internet. We try to see if information is actually backed up by a reliable source.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica’s Great Brain Drain\n\nhttps://www.counterpunch.org/2025/05/09/americas-great-brain-drain/\n(Thanks KB for this)\n\n“A few years ago, no one would have imagined that one of the biggest democracies in the world would cancel research programs under the pretext that the word ‘diversity’ was in this program.” – Macron\n\n\nThe EU has officially launched a drive to attract scientists and researchers that America is discarding by the bucketful, s\n\n\nThis is an extraordinary shrinking of America’s IQ in so many ways that a full understanding is nearly impossible, but it is only too obvious that deliberate destruction of science is the product of a bruised/intimidated mentality that’s seeking payback. There is no other logical explanation.\n\n(Well, the argument of destroying competing power bases is another explanation. If a sharpie can be used to rewrite truth without pesky pushback…)\n\nThe EU is licking its chops over this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. According to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, while on stage at Sorbonne University, the EU Executive Branch has already decided to set up a “super grant” program, aimed at “longer-term perspective to the very best in the field.”\n\n\nthe Commission is authorizing additional funding of $566 million in 2025-2027, making Europe “a magnet for researchers.” This funding is in addition to the European Research Council’s budget of $18 billion for 2021-2027. Moreover, the EU will “enshrine freedom of scientific research into law” via a new enactment. Europe will not compromise on its long-standing principles of academic freedom.\n\n\n“The administration has issued a multi-pronged, anti-science attack on the health sciences. Possibly the most destructive is the recent slashing of research funding for both NIH and the National Science Foundation.” – the Hill 3/2/2025\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists Hail This Medical Breakthrough. A Political Storm Could Cripple It.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/mrna-vaccines-backlash-covid.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Gk8.5Dqo.MAoyAtC3MgsJ&smid=url-share\n(Efforts to direct research away from something for political reasons)\n\nShort for messenger RNA, mRNA exists naturally in every cell of every living organism — its discovery in 1961 was also celebrated with a Nobel Prize. But its association with Covid has thrust it to the center of a political storm, buffeted by vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, anger over lockdowns and mandates, and the ascendance of the Make America Healthy Again movement in the Trump administration.\n\n\nStates and federal health agencies are playing on public wariness about vaccines to cancel research into mRNA more broadly, indicating how much the lingering politicization of Covid is fueling the new attacks on science.\n\n\nOpinion | A.G. Sulzberger: A Free People Need a Free Press - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/opinion/ag-sulzberger-free-press.html\n\nAnd the press is far from the only American institution that finds itself under pressure. We’re seeing direct efforts to go after government agencies, universities, cultural institutions, research organizations, advocacy groups and law firms. We’re even seeing challenges to the authority of Congress and the courts to serve as a check on executive power.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: My Brush With Trump’s Thought Police\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/opinion/stiglitz-trump-dei.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Where to categorize this ham-handed attempt to shut down discourse)\n\nThe email arrived in early February from the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen, carrying a blunt message. It informed the organizers of a Danish lecture series — one I was soon scheduled to speak at — that the final portion of American funding would be released only after they signed a statement essentially saying they were in compliance with a U.S. executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n\nBefore the organizers at the University of Southern Denmark could respond, the U.S. State Department sent an even blunter message: The grant was “being terminated for the convenience of the U.S. government.” It concluded by thanking the Danes “for your partnering with the Department of State and God Bless America.”\n\n\nSecond, the cutoff of funding was followed nearly two weeks later by another message to the university. (I viewed copies of all the emails.) It said that a recent court hearing prevented the State Department from holding up congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds and ordered it to make the financing available. It further ordered the department to “provide written notice of this order” to recipients of grants. Notifying the Danish university was as far as the administration went in complying with the court. The remaining funds haven’t been released yet, organizers say — typical of the Trump administration’s defiance of the courts.\n\n\nAnother core element of freedom — indeed something essential to its survival — is that power must be limited; there have to be checks and balances not just within government but within society. I have long warned that the concentration of wealth among a small percentage of the population would provide a fertile field for a demagogue, and that there was an ample supply of people who might play the part.\n\n\nUniversities, which protect academic freedom, are as important to this system of checks and balances as other civil rights protections like freedom of the press.\n\n\nNYU Withholds Diploma Due to Pro-Palestinian Commencement Speech\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/16/nyu-withholds-diploma-due-pro-palestinian-grad-speech\n\nRozos spoke at the ceremony for the university’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study. He told the crowd he was “freaking out” about delivering the controversial speech, but that he felt a “moral and political” obligation to use the platform to speak out in support of Palestinians. Video of the speech shows graduates in caps and gowns clapping and cheering for Rozos and some giving him a standing ovation, though some boos and jeers can be heard off camera.\n\n\nNYTimes: Springsteen, in England, Blasts Trump Administration as ‘Treasonous’\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/arts/music/bruce-springsteen-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Not anything to do with Higher Ed, but he is the boss…)\n\n\n\n\nMorelle’s Statement on Abrupt Firing of Shira Perlmutter, Register of Copyrights | Committee on House Administration\n\nhttp://democrats-cha.house.gov/media/press-releases/morelles-statement-abrupt-firing-shira-perlmutter-register-copyrights\n\nno coincidence [Trump] acted less than a day after [Perlmutter] refused to rubber-stamp Elon Musk’s efforts to mine troves of copyrighted works to train AI models.” [Rep. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee]\n\n\nPerlmutter and her office issued a lengthy report about artificial intelligence that included some questions and concerns about the usage of copyrighted materials by AI technology, an industry which Musk is heavily involved in.\n\n\n“This action once again tramples on Congress’s Article One authority and throws a trillion-dollar industry into chaos,” Morelle continued in a statement. “When will my Republican colleagues decide enough is enough?”\n\n\n\n\n\nNY city and state lawmakers condemn CUNY chancellor after anti-Israel melee at Brooklyn College: ‘Step up or step down’\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2025/05/11/us-news/ny-lawmakers-condemn-cuny-chancellor-after-anti-israel-melee-at-brooklyn-college-step-up-or-step-down/\n(The usual slanted Post take, not worth reading IMHO, save to learn that the group that beat up on CUNY last fall are back at it.)\n\nIt is unacceptable but not surprising that almost two years after October 7th — after an investigation into CUNY and several public hearings — we are still grappling with disruptive and criminal behavior against Jewish students, encampments and masked agitators on campus,” reads a May 9 letter to Brooklyn College chancellor Félix V.

At Logan International Airport, I did not complete a customs declaration for frog embryos (for use in our lab’s research) in my luggage.\n\n\nInstead, my visa was revoked and I was sent to a detention center in Louisiana, where I have spent the past three months with roughly 100 other women. We share one room with dormitory-style beds.\n\n\nI’m used to spending up to 12 hours a day in the lab, talking with colleagues about tricky scientific questions and fine-tuning the algorithms used for NoRI. At the detention center, there is no access to computers and six phones are shared among all of us. The calls cost $5 for 15 minutes, at which point they cut off. It’s constantly noisy and cold. Fortunately, my beautiful colleagues have mailed me academic articles and books (I’m reading a wonderful one now about biochemistry called “Transformer” that I recommend to everyone).\n\n\n\n\n\nCan Scientific Research Survive Without Federal Funding?\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/business/revenue-strategies/2025/05/12/can-scientific-research-survive-without-federal-funding\n\nIn February, the Yale School of Medicine began offering temporary funding to researchers with terminated grants—many related to topics the Trump administration has deemed unworthy of scientific inquiry, such as transgender health—to give them time to reorient their research. Yale’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is also investing $4 million to support graduate students who have lost training and research grants. Similarly, last month Johns Hopkins University announced that it is tapping earnings from its $13.2 billion endowment to give researchers $100,000 each for delayed grants, or $150,000 for terminated grants, during a 12-month period. And Northwestern University—which hasn’t received any grant payments from the National Institutes of Health since March—is offering faculty up to $50,000 to maintain projects for up to one year.\n\n(Hopefully CUNY will be providing some relief in this manner as well)\n\nOver the past several decades, universities have already substantially increased the amount of money they spend on their own research and development—from 10 percent of the total in 1970 to 25 percent in 2023, according to federal data. Meanwhile, federal support for academic research has been on the decline, falling from 71 percent to 55 percent during that same timeframe. And support from industry, charities and other sources have always been marginal, collectively making up about 15 percent of contributions to research funding at colleges and universities in 2023.\n\n\nWhile that won’t cover all of the terminated grants, “the bridge has to go somewhere,” he said, explaining that the program isn’t supporting projects that don’t have viable alternative long-term funding options. Instead, “we’re providing funding for projects where the faculty member has other sources of funding and other proposals with the same or different federal agencies,” Díaz de la Rubia said.

That number would climb to a 14 percent tax for colleges with endowments valued at $1.25 to $2 million per student. Colleges at the highest level with endowments of $2 million or more per student would pay 21 percent. (Currently, colleges with endowments worth $500,000 per student or more pay the 1.4 percent tax.)\n\n(This is for private colleges.

College leaders argue that increasing the tax rate would harm students by hampering institutions’ ability to offer generous financial aid, which often comes out of endowment earnings.\n\n\nAccording to the National Association of College and University Business Officers, nearly half of colleges’ endowment spending in 2024 went to financial aid, with another 18 percent supporting academic programs and 11 percent paying for endowed faculty positions.\n\n\nRepublicans eye major expansion of college endowment tax\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/09/congress/republicans-eye-massive-expansion-of-college-endowment-tax-00339060\n\nThe slew of endowment taxes comes as Republicans are struggling to find revenue to fund tax cuts and other elements of a megabill carrying President Donald Trump’s policy priorities.\n\n\nGOP proposes five-fold increase in tax on college endowments\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/12/gop-college-endowment-tax/\n(And again…)\n\n\n\n\nTrump DEI policies threaten millions in scholarships raised by Black doctors\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/05/13/black-doctors-scholarship-ohio/\n\n\n\n\nBridge the gap’: After federal grant freeze, CUNY union seeks city funding lifeline to continue research | amNewYork\n\nhttps://www.amny.com/education/federal-grant-freeze-cuny-union-funding/\n\nCUNY warns $17M in research grants at risk after Trump stop-work orders\n\nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/15/cuny-warns-17m-in-research-grants-at-risk-after-trump-stop-work-orders/\n(If I have this right, 17M has been yanked so far.

In Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, published as short stories in the late 1940s and as a novel in 1953, warned not only of the destruction of books, but of a society in which people had lost the desire to read them. The parallel today is not only the administration’s effort to destroy and suppress knowledge, but also the institution’s willingness to accept the cultivated irrelevance of it—a challenge that undermines any serious effort to conduct research, inform policy, or guide public institutions.\n\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF)—established as an independent agency through the National Science Act of 1950 and marking its 75th anniversary this week—traces its roots to Vannevar Bush’s landmark report, “Science, the Endless Frontier,” addressed to President Harry S. Truman. But we might also see the establishment of this premier research institution as reflecting a response to fears depicted by Bradbury. The NSF can be understood not only as a catalyst of scientific promise for national purpose, but also as a guarded response to fears about centralized control over knowledge and thought, shaped by the dark shadows of the Third Reich and the emerging Red Scare.\n\n\nLast week, as the Board held its 494th meeting, I listened to NSF staff say that DOGE had by fiat the authority to give thumbs up or down to grant applications which had been systematically vetted by layers of subject matter experts.\n\n\nOur closed-to-the-public deliberations were observed by Zachary Terrell from the DOGE team. Through his Zoom screen, Terrell showed more interest in his water bottle and his cuticles than in the discussion. According to Nature Terrell, listed as a “consultant” in the NSF directory, had accessed the NSF awards system to block the dispersal of approved grants. The message I received was that the National Science Board had a role to play in name only.\n\n\nAll of this is threatened by the creeping normalization of authoritarian approaches to knowledge management and academic freedom. The National Science Board has not been disbanded like so many other statutorily established, independent agencies in the federal government. But preservation of form provides little consolation when function has been strategically neutralized, mirroring the backsliding that scholars have thoroughly documented: maintaining legitimacy for institutions that no longer honor their founding purposes. This hollowing out is not just about governance in the abstract, it has material consequences for which research questions get asked, which datasets get produced, which knowledge gets produced, and which perspectives shape our understanding of pressing societal challenges. It has consequences for the integrity of knowledge itself.\n\n\nLast week, the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, was summarily dismissed via an email addressed to “Carla” from a White House HR administrator. The Trump Administration claimed that she was fired for “things she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.” It is true that Hayden was repeatedly on record as saying the Library should be for all Americans. And it is false that the Library, which is intended to hold all books published in the United States, lends books to children. The ouster of Hayden is part of a broader pattern of political targeting of women and Black public servants across the federal government.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Cancels Scores of Grants to Study Online Misinformation\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/trump-online-misinformation-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast month, the National Science Foundation, a government agency that finances much of the scientific research in the United States, began canceling hundreds of grants. Most focused on studies involving issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, but scores singled out work on online content.\n\n\nThe cancellation has jeopardized research in universities in virtually every state, leaving researchers scrambling to find funding for projects that in many cases are only partly completed.\n\n\nEach Friday since then, the foundation has announced new cancellations. It has now cut more than 1,400 grants, including 75 more last Friday. In all, the grants were worth more than $1 billion, according to a list compiled by two researchers, Scott W. Delaney, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health, and Noam Ross, the executive director of rOpenSci, a nonprofit software foundation. None of the grant abstracts reviewed by The New York Times called for censoring content.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Cuts Off Budding CUNY Scientists From Mentorship and Aid\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/05/14/cuny-urise-science-research-nih-trump/\n\nThe Trump administration has cut off support that has sustained a teaching model that for decades has been instrumental in catapulting students into careers as scientists.\n\n\nFunded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE) supports the pursuit of advanced degrees by students in the biomedical field, who are offered tuition assistance, mentorship, registration to professional conferences and, crucially, lab experience.\n\n\nNIH canceled all U-RISE funding at City College, Queens College, Brooklyn College, Lehman College and Medgar Evers College. … Professors who work with students in the program say the federal defunding will likely doom the program, and with it vital opportunities to conduct research while attending a public college — putting them on track for further academic research.\n\n\n“University leadership is working to support everyone in our community and will pursue every avenue available to sustain CUNY as a preeminent research institution,” wrote Noah Gardy.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEH Announces Grant Opportunity to Create Statues of Iconic Americans for the National Garden of American Heroes | National Endowment for the Humanities\n\nhttps://www.neh.gov/news/neh-announces-grant-opportunity-create-statues-iconic-americans-national-garden-american\n(This isn’t new, but still galling)\n\nThe NIH Is Requiring Grantees to Follow Trump’s Anti-Trans Executive Order\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-nih-is-requiring-grantees-to-follow-trumps-anti-trans-executive-order\n\nAnd she [researcher at a teaching hospital] learned that the grantee was expected to comply with the gender-equity law Title IX — “including the requirements set forth in Presidential Executive Order 14168 titled Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” That’s the executive order President Trump signed on the first day of his second term, directing the government to recognize two sexes, male and female.\n\n\nThe new policies apply to institutions that accept funds on scientists’ behalf, according to two lawyers who reviewed the language. So if a university accepts a grant with these terms, it could be at risk if the government considers anyone at that campus — not just the scientist spending the money — to be perpetuating “DEI” or “gender ideology extremism.”\n\n\nThe NIH reserves the right to “terminate financial assistance awards and recover all funds,” states its April 21 policy on diversity. And the term sheet citing the anti-transgender executive order states that payments “are predicated on compliance with the above requirements.” It says that violators can be held liable criminally as well as under the False Claims Act, the anti-government defraudment law.\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Association of American Universities, which represents research universities, said that the organization was aware of the language, but declined to comment further.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Nominates Iowa Regent to be Assistant Secretary of Postsecondary Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/12/trump-nominates-assistant-secretary-postsecondary-ed\n\n[David] Barker would focus on improving outcomes and accountability by reforming accreditation, improving federal student aid programs and ensuring grant programs match the Trump administration’s priorities.\n\n\nBarker was an Iowa regent for six years where he advanced cost control measures, promoted academic freedom and ended “discriminatory DEI programs,” according to the release.\n\n(On wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_R._Barker] we can read about what planet this guy lives on: “Barker is the author of Welcome to Free America, a book set in 2057 as a guide to immigrants coming to the former United States after the collapse of government.

The change, according to the NSF, “is intended to streamline funding practices, increase transparency, and ensure that more resources are directed toward direct scientific and engineering research activities.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQatar has showered money on the U.S.’s military and universities, giving the tiny Gulf state outsize geopolitical clout\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/qatar-us-influence-spending-7a64dd75?st=JmAtR8&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nAround the same time that the base was gearing up, Qatar began paying top U.S. universities to operate campuses on Qatari territory. It is now the single largest foreign funder of American universities, according to U.S. Education Department data, providing more than $6 billion over the past 15 years through gifts or contracts with schools including Cornell, Georgetown and Northwestern.\n\n\nThe outsize higher-education funding levels have drawn criticism since the start of Israel’s war in Gaza from Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration over allegations that the money from Qatar and other Arab states was skewing teaching about Israel and the region. Education Secretary Linda McMahon singled out Qatar in an April 23 statement on an executive order expanding oversight on foreign education gifts.\n\n\nAnsari denied that Qatar interferes in the curriculum of any U.S. educational institution or has any influence on U.S. universities, calling that “deliberate misinformation” by “a campaign of bad actors” aiming to weaken the U.S. relationship and undermine Qatar’s mediation role in the Gaza war.\n\n(Not simply fake news, but bad actors)\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: The World Is Wooing U.S. Researchers Shunned by Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/business/economy/trump-research-brain-drain.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nNYTimes: We Study Fascism.

The university, it alleged, had violated Title IX by allowing transgender female students in women’s restrooms, locker rooms, and dorm rooms.\n\n\nPayton McNabb, a former student whose complaints about WCU’s transgender policies brought conservative media attention to the university, said she didn’t experience WCU as quiet. She felt professors treated conservative students differently, and she was hurt by a university Title IX investigation into her conduct after she posted a video of herself asking a transgender woman why she was in a women’s bathroom on campus.\n\n\nThe emails that seem to have triggered the Department of Education’s investigation have been framed by Speech First [a group dedicated to protecting the expression of certain conservative stances at colleges] as evidence that WCU is deliberately defying President Donald Trump.\n\n\nThe Department of Education’s scrutiny “feels punitive,” Gómez [secretary for the Faculty Senate] said. “It feels like this is part of a trend to both try to dismantle higher education and to ultimately undermine faculty governance and academic freedom.” The department’s Title IX investigation is related to faculty governance, Gómez said, because the Faculty Senate had previously supported an effort to make campus bathrooms more welcoming to transgender people.\n\n\nOn Student Aid, It’s Congressional Republicans vs. DOGE\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/on-student-aid-its-congressional-republicans-vs-doge\n\nThe House Committee on Education & Workforce recently drafted legislation that would cut $350 billion in student aid. The savings come mostly from increasing loan-payment requirements and making it harder to qualify for Pell Grants. As others have explained, these measures will harm the lowest-income borrowers and reduce college access. If the committee has its way, the cuts will be bundled into a reconciliation bill in which these savings would pay for tax cuts tilted heavily toward the wealthy.\n\n\nanother surprising roadblock to the House accountability provisions should loom large: …DOGE. … Now that DOGE has forced out half the Education Department’s staff and President Trump is looking to eviscerate it, such execution will be out of reach. In other words, today’s Republican Party has a lot of different factions, but they can’t all win: If conservative lawmakers mean for the department to implement the accountability ideas in their current proposal, they will need to confront the Trump administration.\n\n\n\n\n\nSurely Not?\n\nhttps://www.nybooks.com/articles/2025/05/29/surely-not-manchurian-candidate-president/\n(VAC says this is worth reading, though it is behind a paywall.)\n\nImagine that the president of the United States was a “Manchurian candidate,” an embedded foreign agent determined to wreak maximum damage on the country and limited only by the need not to act so outrageously and preposterously as to blow his cover.

It informed the organizers of a Danish lecture series — one I was soon scheduled to speak at — that the final portion of American funding would be released only after they signed a statement essentially saying they were in compliance with a U.S. executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n\nBefore the organizers at the University of Southern Denmark could respond, the U.S. State Department sent an even blunter message: The grant was “being terminated for the convenience of the U.S. government.” It concluded by thanking the Danes “for your partnering with the Department of State and God Bless America.”\n\n\nSecond, the cutoff of funding was followed nearly two weeks later by another message to the university. (I viewed copies of all the emails.) It said that a recent court hearing prevented the State Department from holding up congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds and ordered it to make the financing available. It further ordered the department to “provide written notice of this order” to recipients of grants. Notifying the Danish university was as far as the administration went in complying with the court. The remaining funds haven’t been released yet, organizers say — typical of the Trump administration’s defiance of the courts.\n\n\nAnother core element of freedom — indeed something essential to its survival — is that power must be limited; there have to be checks and balances not just within government but within society. I have long warned that the concentration of wealth among a small percentage of the population would provide a fertile field for a demagogue, and that there was an ample supply of people who might play the part.\n\n\nUniversities, which protect academic freedom, are as important to this system of checks and balances as other civil rights protections like freedom of the press.\n\n\nNYU Withholds Diploma Due to Pro-Palestinian Commencement Speech\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/16/nyu-withholds-diploma-due-pro-palestinian-grad-speech\n\nRozos spoke at the ceremony for the university’s Gallatin School of Individualized Study.

Yale’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is also investing $4 million to support graduate students who have lost training and research grants. Similarly, last month Johns Hopkins University announced that it is tapping earnings from its $13.2 billion endowment to give researchers $100,000 each for delayed grants, or $150,000 for terminated grants, during a 12-month period. And Northwestern University—which hasn’t received any grant payments from the National Institutes of Health since March—is offering faculty up to $50,000 to maintain projects for up to one year.\n\n(Hopefully CUNY will be providing some relief in this manner as well)\n\nOver the past several decades, universities have already substantially increased the amount of money they spend on their own research and development—from 10 percent of the total in 1970 to 25 percent in 2023, according to federal data. Meanwhile, federal support for academic research has been on the decline, falling from 71 percent to 55 percent during that same timeframe. And support from industry, charities and other sources have always been marginal, collectively making up about 15 percent of contributions to research funding at colleges and universities in 2023.\n\n\nWhile that won’t cover all of the terminated grants, “the bridge has to go somewhere,” he said, explaining that the program isn’t supporting projects that don’t have viable alternative long-term funding options.

The parallel today is not only the administration’s effort to destroy and suppress knowledge, but also the institution’s willingness to accept the cultivated irrelevance of it—a challenge that undermines any serious effort to conduct research, inform policy, or guide public institutions.\n\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF)—established as an independent agency through the National Science Act of 1950 and marking its 75th anniversary this week—traces its roots to Vannevar Bush’s landmark report, “Science, the Endless Frontier,” addressed to President Harry S. Truman. But we might also see the establishment of this premier research institution as reflecting a response to fears depicted by Bradbury. The NSF can be understood not only as a catalyst of scientific promise for national purpose, but also as a guarded response to fears about centralized control over knowledge and thought, shaped by the dark shadows of the Third Reich and the emerging Red Scare.\n\n\nLast week, as the Board held its 494th meeting, I listened to NSF staff say that DOGE had by fiat the authority to give thumbs up or down to grant applications which had been systematically vetted by layers of subject matter experts.\n\n\nOur closed-to-the-public deliberations were observed by Zachary Terrell from the DOGE team. Through his Zoom screen, Terrell showed more interest in his water bottle and his cuticles than in the discussion. According to Nature Terrell, listed as a “consultant” in the NSF directory, had accessed the NSF awards system to block the dispersal of approved grants. The message I received was that the National Science Board had a role to play in name only.\n\n\nAll of this is threatened by the creeping normalization of authoritarian approaches to knowledge management and academic freedom. The National Science Board has not been disbanded like so many other statutorily established, independent agencies in the federal government. But preservation of form provides little consolation when function has been strategically neutralized, mirroring the backsliding that scholars have thoroughly documented: maintaining legitimacy for institutions that no longer honor their founding purposes. This hollowing out is not just about governance in the abstract, it has material consequences for which research questions get asked, which datasets get produced, which knowledge gets produced, and which perspectives shape our understanding of pressing societal challenges. It has consequences for the integrity of knowledge itself.\n\n\nLast week, the Librarian of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden, was summarily dismissed via an email addressed to “Carla” from a White House HR administrator. The Trump Administration claimed that she was fired for “things she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.” It is true that Hayden was repeatedly on record as saying the Library should be for all Americans. And it is false that the Library, which is intended to hold all books published in the United States, lends books to children. The ouster of Hayden is part of a broader pattern of political targeting of women and Black public servants across the federal government.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Cancels Scores of Grants to Study Online Misinformation\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/business/trump-online-misinformation-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast month, the National Science Foundation, a government agency that finances much of the scientific research in the United States, began canceling hundreds of grants. Most focused on studies involving issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, but scores singled out work on online content.\n\n\nThe cancellation has jeopardized research in universities in virtually every state, leaving researchers scrambling to find funding for projects that in many cases are only partly completed.\n\n\nEach Friday since then, the foundation has announced new cancellations. It has now cut more than 1,400 grants, including 75 more last Friday. In all, the grants were worth more than $1 billion, according to a list compiled by two researchers, Scott W. Delaney, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health, and Noam Ross, the executive director of rOpenSci, a nonprofit software foundation. None of the grant abstracts reviewed by The New York Times called for censoring content.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Cuts Off Budding CUNY Scientists From Mentorship and Aid\n\nhttps://www.thecity.nyc/2025/05/14/cuny-urise-science-research-nih-trump/\n\nThe Trump administration has cut off support that has sustained a teaching model that for decades has been instrumental in catapulting students into careers as scientists.\n\n\nFunded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-RISE) supports the pursuit of advanced degrees by students in the biomedical field, who are offered tuition assistance, mentorship, registration to professional conferences and, crucially, lab experience.\n\n\nNIH canceled all U-RISE funding at City College, Queens College, Brooklyn College, Lehman College and Medgar Evers College. … Professors who work with students in the program say the federal defunding will likely doom the program, and with it vital opportunities to conduct research while attending a public college — putting them on track for further academic research.\n\n\n“University leadership is working to support everyone in our community and will pursue every avenue available to sustain CUNY as a preeminent research institution,” wrote Noah Gardy.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEH Announces Grant Opportunity to Create Statues of Iconic Americans for the National Garden of American Heroes | National Endowment for the Humanities\n\nhttps://www.neh.gov/news/neh-announces-grant-opportunity-create-statues-iconic-americans-national-garden-american\n(This isn’t new, but still galling)\n\nThe NIH Is Requiring Grantees to Follow Trump’s Anti-Trans Executive Order\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/the-nih-is-requiring-grantees-to-follow-trumps-anti-trans-executive-order\n\nAnd she [researcher at a teaching hospital] learned that the grantee was expected to comply with the gender-equity law Title IX — “including the requirements set forth in Presidential Executive Order 14168 titled Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” That’s the executive order President Trump signed on the first day of his second term, directing the government to recognize two sexes, male and female.\n\n\nThe new policies apply to institutions that accept funds on scientists’ behalf, according to two lawyers who reviewed the language. So if a university accepts a grant with these terms, it could be at risk if the government considers anyone at that campus — not just the scientist spending the money — to be perpetuating “DEI” or “gender ideology extremism.”\n\n\nThe NIH reserves the right to “terminate financial assistance awards and recover all funds,” states its April 21 policy on diversity. And the term sheet citing the anti-transgender executive order states that payments “are predicated on compliance with the above requirements.” It says that violators can be held liable criminally as well as under the False Claims Act, the anti-government defraudment law.\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Association of American Universities, which represents research universities, said that the organization was aware of the language, but declined to comment further.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Nominates Iowa Regent to be Assistant Secretary of Postsecondary Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/12/trump-nominates-assistant-secretary-postsecondary-ed\n\n[David] Barker would focus on improving outcomes and accountability by reforming accreditation, improving federal student aid programs and ensuring grant programs match the Trump administration’s priorities.\n\n\nBarker was an Iowa regent for six years where he advanced cost control measures, promoted academic freedom and ended “discriminatory DEI programs,” according to the release.\n\n(On wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_R._Barker] we can read about what planet this guy lives on: “Barker is the author of Welcome to Free America, a book set in 2057 as a guide to immigrants coming to the former United States after the collapse of government. It describes a difficult period of transition, but eventually, private companies take over functions previously performed by governments, such as security, dispute resolution, production of money and infrastructure, and national defense.”)\n\n\n\n\nThe hidden ways Trump, DOGE are shutting down parts of the U.S. government\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/05/11/trump-government-operations-halt-funding-cuts/\n(Nothing higher ed related, but similar things are reported with grants.

The change, according to the NSF, “is intended to streamline funding practices, increase transparency, and ensure that more resources are directed toward direct scientific and engineering research activities.”",

The university, it alleged, had violated Title IX by allowing transgender female students in women’s restrooms, locker rooms, and dorm rooms.\n\n\nPayton McNabb, a former student whose complaints about WCU’s transgender policies brought conservative media attention to the university, said she didn’t experience WCU as quiet. She felt professors treated conservative students differently, and she was hurt by a university Title IX investigation into her conduct after she posted a video of herself asking a transgender woman why she was in a women’s bathroom on campus.\n\n\nThe emails that seem to have triggered the Department of Education’s investigation have been framed by Speech First [a group dedicated to protecting the expression of certain conservative stances at colleges] as evidence that WCU is deliberately defying President Donald Trump.\n\n\nThe Department of Education’s scrutiny “feels punitive,” Gómez [secretary for the Faculty Senate] said. “It feels like this is part of a trend to both try to dismantle higher education and to ultimately undermine faculty governance and academic freedom.” The department’s Title IX investigation is related to faculty governance, Gómez said, because the Faculty Senate had previously supported an effort to make campus bathrooms more welcoming to transgender people.\n\n\nOn Student Aid, It’s Congressional Republicans vs. DOGE\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/on-student-aid-its-congressional-republicans-vs-doge\n\nThe House Committee on Education & Workforce recently drafted legislation that would cut $350 billion in student aid. The savings come mostly from increasing loan-payment requirements and making it harder to qualify for Pell Grants. As others have explained, these measures will harm the lowest-income borrowers and reduce college access. If the committee has its way, the cuts will be bundled into a reconciliation bill in which these savings would pay for tax cuts tilted heavily toward the wealthy.\n\n\nanother surprising roadblock to the House accountability provisions should loom large: …DOGE. … Now that DOGE has forced out half the Education Department’s staff and President Trump is looking to eviscerate it, such execution will be out of reach. In other words, today’s Republican Party has a lot of different factions, but they can’t all win: If conservative lawmakers mean for the department to implement the accountability ideas in their current proposal, they will need to confront the Trump administration.",

Schneider, a German scholar who has worked for C.E.U. for more than 20 years and will become its interim president and rector in August.\n\n\n“These demands, these requirements, they are a scale of detail that Orban never bothered with,” Tim Crane, a Britain-born philosophy professor, said at C.E.U.\n\n\n“Universities and their allies need to speak up in defense of core values,” she [Amy Gutmann, a political scientist who led the University of Pennsylvania for nearly 18 years and then served as President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s ambassador to Germany] said, adding that “the C.E.U. experience warns against the instinct to make concessions to an administration that’s intent on punishing the political opposition.”\n\n\nIn Mr. Orban’s Hungary, sometimes described as a “propaganda state,” the government transferred control of public universities to foundations — controlled by the ruling party’s allies — and gender studies essentially became a forbidden academic discipline.\n\n\nIn 2017, the Hungarian government, which some prominent figures on the American right have praised, stepped up its effort to undermine the American-accredited university. The campaign was built on legal maneuvering, including a hastily passed law, struck down years later by the European Court of Justice, effectively requiring C.E.U. to open a new campus in the United States.\n\n\nThe university tried to negotiate, but talks with the Hungarian government failed in late 2018. Thousands of Hungarians protested the government’s tactics that year — “Even Voldemort didn’t kick Hogwarts out,” read one sign — but C.E.U. said it had no choice but to leave.\n\n\nEva Kiser, a museum studies student at C.E.U. who is from Knoxville, Tenn., said she had been counting on political firewalls in the United States to hold and that things would “blow over.”\n\n\n“But that’s not really looking probable,” she said.\n\n\n“Don’t expect mercy, or that this is normal and you need to sort of be nice and then they come to their senses,” Dr. Schneider, the incoming interim rector, said. “It is unhinged. …”\n\n\nBorrowing an idea from the economist Albert O. Hirschman, Professor Dorsch, an American, said universities had three options: leave, obey the government or speak up.\n\n(Lots of salient quotes here, an article well worth reading, as the mafia state has learned some things from the propaganda state.)\n\nNotes from an Occupation\n\nhttps://www.nybooks.com/articles/2025/06/26/notes-from-an-occupation-marilynne-robinson/\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nA well-planned occupation seizes the heights of the defeated civilization, so that the people will see their leaders ousted or humiliated and made docile. It will likewise discredit and weaken those features of the culture in which its people placed confidence and pride. If this model were applied to our situation, we might expect to see the Supreme Court diminished, the Congress disempowered, and the Constitution desacralized by indifference or contempt. The press would come under attack. Our incomparable universities and research institutions would lose autonomy and resources. The mighty dollar would be weakened. Bonds with allies would be breached, and the occupied country would be held in contempt for the damage its default had done to the world order, and to democracy, having put aside its responsibility for demonstrating the viability of popular government.\n\n\nExamples of the seizing of cultural heights abound. In 70 AD the Romans utterly razed the Temple at Jerusalem and Jerusalem itself in order to deal with the Jewish population’s resistance to their oppression. In 1814 the British, still wanting to break the back of the Revolution, burned the American Capitol Building, destroying the Library of Congress.\n\n\nI am proposing, of course, that America actually is, at present, an occupied country. I will call the occupiers Red and the occupied Blue, since these colors are in general use for distinctions of this kind and seemingly cause no offense.\n\n(More behind a paywall, I’m sure)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: We Watched Dozens of Graduation Speeches.

Some of the groups involved include OEDP, the Data Rescue Project, Safeguarding Research and Culture, the Internet Archive, the End of Term Archive, and the Data.gov Archive, which is run by the Harvard Law School Library.\n\n\n… “That took time,” Richards said, noting that not every data set and its accompanying metadata was easy to replicate. “Each varied significantly. Some required scraping. In one case I had to manually download 400 files, clicking each one every few minutes.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIH scientists go public with criticism over Trump cuts | AP News\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/nih-letter-bethesda-declaration-bhattacharya-89724aee201f3e99fc1159adcbf9ac94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFulbright Board Quits, Accusing Trump Administration of Political Interference - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/politics/fulbright-board-resign-trump.html\n\nThe dozen board members of the prestigious Fulbright program that promotes international educational exchanges resigned on Wednesday because of what they said was political interference by the Trump administration in their operations, according to people familiar with the issues and a board memo obtained by The New York Times.\n\nhttps://substack.com/inbox/post/165673358?r=17cemi\n\nThe members are concerned that political appointees at the State Department, which manages the program, are acting illegally by canceling the awarding of Fulbright scholarships to almost 200 American professors and researchers who are prepared to go to universities and other research institutions overseas starting this summer,\n\n\nIn addition, the department is reviewing the applications of about 1,200 scholars from other countries who have already been approved by the board to come to the United States, the people said. Those foreign scholars were also supposed to receive acceptance letters around April.\n\n\nThe board is also concerned that the budget that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is requesting from Congress for the next fiscal year cuts spending for the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, which includes the Fulbright program, to $50 million from $691 million this fiscal year.\n\n\n“The bipartisan Fulbright Board was mandated by Congress to be a check on the executive and to ensure that students, researchers and educators are not subjected to the blatant political favoritism that this administration is known for,” Ms. Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.\n\n\n“While I understand and respect the bipartisan Fulbright Board for resigning en masse rather than grant credibility to a politicized and unlawful process,” she added, “I am painfully aware that today’s move will change the quality of Fulbright programming and the independent research that has made our country a leader in so many fields.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColleges Can’t Trust the Federal Government. What Now?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/colleges-cant-trust-the-federal-government-what-now\n\nSupport from the federal government has been so consistent and made such good sense that colleges and universities have built their budgets, infrastructure, and programming around the assumption of its permanence. Trump 2.0 has shown what happens when the government does not behave sensibly and has turned an essential lifeline into an existential risk.\n\n\nThe scorched-earth assault on Harvard University is generating all the headlines, but it might in fact be drawing attention away from an even larger story: the tectonic shift in the future activities and financial underpinnings of American higher education and the even greater risk to institutions that have neither Harvard’s resources nor Harvard’s reputation.\n\n\nEven if universities manage to muddle through Trump’s vindictive irrationality, can they return to building budget models that assume consistently high levels of federal support? JD Vance is waiting in the wings, and who knows what new Trumps and Vances the future might bring?\n\n\nA small group of the most prestigious and selective universities might be able to substitute affluent domestic students for affluent international students at the undergraduate level, though even those institutions would likely have trouble doing so for master’s-degree programs, where costs are high and return on investment can be questionable. For most colleges, such a substitution would be impossible and tuition revenue would necessarily decline. Subtract the full-paying international students from the applicant pool and an already fragile financial structure would begin very quickly to collapse.\n\n\nFor the ideologues driving the administration’s policies on education and immigration — Linda McMahon and Kristi Noem are not the brains behind this operation — the destructive effects of these various policies are very much the point. None of the consequences we are seeing are unintended.\n\n\nDevastating scientific research and systematically undermining the preeminence of American universities — like so many of the actions of the Trump administration — represents a triumph of vindictiveness and nihilism over sound public policy. But here we are, about to see how quickly and adroitly the embattled and change-resistant world of higher education can adapt to a future in which the government cannot be trusted.\n\n\n\n\n\nCiting Ohio’s SB 1, College Refuses to Sign Union Contract\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/labor-unionization/2025/06/12/citing-ohios-sb-1-college-refuses-sign-union\n\nUnited Faculty of Central Ohio Technical College union members and their institution are both citing state law in a dispute over whether the institution must sign a new collective bargaining agreement—or gut provisions it agreed to earlier in order to comply with the state’s sweeping new public higher education law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Texas, University Presidents May Soon Control Faculty Senates\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/06/09/texas-presidents-may-soon-control-faculty-senates\n\nA bill awaiting Gov. Abbott’s signature would require college administrators to set procedures for faculty governing bodies and appoint their leaders, part of an effort to address “liberal faculty control over universities.”\n\n\n“Shared governance structures may not be used to obstruct, delay, or undermine necessary institutional reforms or serve as a mechanism for advancing ideological or political agendas,” says Senate Bill 37, which the Republican-dominated State Legislature passed May 31. Multiple states have considered GOP bills targeting shared governance, but SB 37 is a sweeping example.\n\n\nIf a college or university board decides to keep a faculty governing body, the institution’s president gets to prescribe how it conducts meetings. The president also gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary.”\n\n\nIn addition, unless the college or university’s board decides otherwise, faculty senates and councils must shrink to no more than 60 members.\n\n\nIn another blow to faculty control of their own governance bodies, SB 37 establishes term limits for faculty senate and council members—and allows presidential appointees to serve longer than the elected members.\n\n(Two years, then a two year break)\n\nA faculty senate or council member could also have their seat stripped at any time; the bill says the provost can recommend to the president that members be “immediately removed” for failing to attend meetings or conduct their “responsibilities within the council’s or senate’s parameters” or for “similar misconduct.”\n\n(Will this be a national template if Abbott signs this bill? The reporting attributes the bill to one legislator, but I doubt their office drafted it.)\n\nTrump Ends Vital Higher Ed Data System Training\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/09/department-education-discontinues-ipeds-training\n\nUsed to track trends in higher education enrollment, completion, financial aid usage and other institutional characteristics, IPEDS survey data has long been critical to higher education research.

Both would cap graduate loans, open up the Pell Grant program to short-term programs and cut all but one option for income-driven loan repayment.\n\n\nMost notably, the Senate bill does not include a limit on traditional Pell Grant eligibility that would have excluded thousands of part-time students, as the House version did, and it walks back the House’s controversial risk-sharing plan, which would force colleges to pay a penalty based on students’ unpaid loans.\n\n\nRepublicans are keen on college sports legislation.

Now Trump May Force Him Out.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/07/us/trump-harvard-international-student-ban.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFive weeks later, just after the end of the spring semester, Mr. Williamson [rom Wales], now at a summer abroad program, picked up his phone and saw a pileup of missed calls and messages. The threat his friends had dismissed had become a searing reality: The federal government had effectively blocked Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students — abruptly thrusting Mr. Williamson and others into an excruciating limbo.\n\n\nHe had arrived in Cambridge, Mass., intent on studying physics, drawn to its broad range of useful applications in other sciences. Then, during his first semester, he found a new passion — in a politics course taught by Steven Levitsky, the author of the best-selling book “How Democracies Die,” that featured a deep dive into authoritarianism. After that, Mr. Williamson planned to become a double major in physics and government. Maybe someday, he thought, he would make his own foray into politics or public service.\n\n\n“It was the best year of my life,” he said.\n\n\nIn recent weeks, long-simmering Republican anger over Harvard’s links to China has increasingly gained traction\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/world/china/harvards-china-ties-become-new-front-in-battle-with-trump-6eb24947?st=D2uR9P&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(There is always something to stir up republican anger…)\n\nTrump indicated that his concern about the Xinjiang corps was based on findings of a House Select Committee on China. Its chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar (R., Mich.), late last month wrote to Harvard President Alan Garber, demanding explanations about university activities that “create risks to U.S. national security and further the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) genocide in Xinjiang.”\n\n\nIn Public, Harvard Is Fighting Trump. Quietly, It’s Dismantling a Program the White House Doesn’t Like.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/in-public-harvard-is-fighting-trump-quietly-its-dismantling-a-program-the-white-house-doesnt-like\n\nHarvard University has spent the last year slowly dismantling a religious-studies program that critics said was biased against Israel, five current and former university employees told The Chronicle. Last week, the final hammer fell: The five remaining staff members employed by the Religion and Public Life program were called, one by one, into meetings with a representative from Harvard’s human-resources department and the program’s interim director, David F. Holland. There, all learned their contracts would not be renewed.\n\n\nThe program puts out a “wide range” of events and courses, McKanan said. But since the October 7 attacks, the program’s teaching around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has drawn criticism from those who argue Harvard’s campus is a hotbed of antisemitism.\n\n\nIn an internal report on antisemitism published in April, a task force of professors, students, and advisers had suggested that a lack of rigor among “nonladder” faculty at Harvard was partly to blame for programs and events that task-force members characterized as antisemitic. The task force recommended tenured Harvard faculty members exercise greater oversight of programs.\n\n\nNonladder — or non-tenure-track — faculty deliver about half of the curriculum at the Divinity School, said McKanan, who has a nonladder contract and has been at Harvard for 17 years. “When Harvard chooses to rely on nonladder faculty,” he said, “it becomes a little bit strange and unnatural to exclude that half of the faculty from program leadership and from sponsoring public events on issues of urgent public concern.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Rubio Is Pressing to Open Sanctions Investigation Into Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/politics/rubio-is-pressing-to-open-sanctions-investigation-into-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(More weaponization of the federal government, err “Trump administration’s whole-of-government approach to bringing the Ivy League university to heel.”)\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is pushing to investigate whether Harvard University violated federal sanctions by collaborating on a health insurance conference in China that may have included officials blacklisted by the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The New York Times.\n\n\nMr. Trump and his allies appear determined [hell-bent] to upend nearly all aspects of the institution, which has long symbolized the pinnacle of higher learning in the country and attracted influential scholars from around the globe.\n\n(And here we see the fingerprints of the Manhattan Institute)\n\nStill, the X.P.C.C.’s involvement in the conference only recently gained attention from Trump allies, after a report about Harvard’s links to China published on April 22 by Strategy Risks, a New York-based intelligence company specializing in corporate exposure to China. The report was funded by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank that has advised Republican policymakers.\n\n\nNYTimes: What Happens if ‘Harvard Is Not Harvard’?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/harvard-funding-trump-administration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n“Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” school officials wrote in a lawsuit asking a judge to stop the federal government’s actions.\n\n\nIt left unsaid what Harvard, if it were no longer Harvard, would become.\n\n\nBut without federal dollars or international talent, experts say, Harvard could fall out of the top tier for research, where it currently sits with competitors like Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. By sheer dollars spent, its research budget could shrink to something similar to that of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, which spent just over $800 million on research in 2023, roughly half of what Harvard spends now.\n\n\nHarvard could choose to negotiate. But inside the university, officials appear reluctant to do that, given the backlash they could face for capitulating to Mr. Trump. This spring, the university took out $750 million in debt, giving it some cash flow as court decisions play out.\n\n\nThe atmosphere is particularly tense inside the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which relies on federal funding for 46 percent of its budget and has a student body that is about 40 percent international. Senior officials there are planning for the worst, and have called the potential changes an “existential crisis” for the school’s future.\n\n\nBut Harvard’s biggest source of funding is donations and payouts from its endowment, which together make up 45 percent of its revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Indiana U., Professors Spar With Administrators Over Nighttime Protests\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/at-indiana-u-professors-spar-with-administrators-over-nighttime-protests\n\nUnder a policy passed in response to a monthslong pro-Palestinian encampment at Indiana, certain forms of “expressive activity” — including holding protests, making speeches, and circulating petitions — were banned on campus between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Administrators argued that the changes were necessary to ensure safety after the encampment got out of hand.\n\n\nThe policy banned protests between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., required 10-day prior approval for installing “structures and/or mass physical objects,” and pushed protests 25 feet away from building entrances.\n\n\nStudents and staff sued over the policy. In late May, a federal judge temporarily blocked the nighttime restrictions.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the political climate surrounding the university remains contentious. Last week, Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, removed the three alumni-elected trustees from Indiana’s board — including two who voted against the expressive-activity policy — and replaced them with conservatives, including a prominent lawyer and a former ESPN anchor.\n\n\nTexas lawmakers just approved legislation broadly banning “any speech or expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment” between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. at public universities. The measure now awaits the governor’s signature.\n\n\nBut Indiana’s expressive-activity policy never specified how many nighttime protesters were too many. That meant even a protest involving two people — unlikely to be a threat to public safety — would require prior approval, the judge said in her order granting the preliminary injunction.\n\n\nWhile the decision was far from “novel or surprising,” it will hopefully send a message to universities imposing similar policies that “the courts are not going to put up with this kind of similarly open violation of the First Amendment and so they probably shouldn’t try it,” said Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the George Washington University Law School.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Administration Proposes Cutting Tribal College Funds by Nearly 90% — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/tribal-colleges-universities-trump-cuts-funding\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed cutting funding for tribal colleges and universities by nearly 90%, a move that would likely shut down most or all of the institutions created to serve students disadvantaged by the nation’s historic mistreatment of Indigenous communities.\n\n\nThe document mentions only the two federally controlled tribal colleges — Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute — but notes the request for postsecondary programs will drop from more than $182 million this year to just over $22 million for 2026.\n\n\nInside UNC’s Effort to Launch a New Accreditor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/accreditation/2025/06/06/emails-shed-light-uncs-plans-create-new-accreditor\n\nLast month, Peter Hans, president of the University of North Carolina system, casually dropped a bombshell announcement that the system and others were in talks to launch a new accreditor.\n\n\n“We’ve been having a number of discussions with several other major public university systems, where we’re exploring the idea of creating an accreditor that would offer sound oversight,” Hans said at a UNC system Board of Governors meeting last month, The News & Observer reported.\n\n\nhave been quietly engaged in conversations about launching a new accreditor for at least a year, including discussions with unnamed collaborators in Florida, where the effort could be headquartered. UNC officials have also spoken with officials at the U.S. Department of Education, even getting a heads-up on what an April 23 executive order from the Trump administration on accreditation would entail.\n\n\n“Everything Florida has done on accreditation over the past few years appears to be politically and ideologically driven, rather than about what is best for students and ensuring that they go to high-quality institutions and get a good education when they’re paying a lot of money for it and when taxpayers are investing a lot of money in public funding for higher education,” he said [Edward Conroy, a senior policy manager at the left-leaning think tank New America].\n\n\nConroy worries that state lawmakers in either Florida or North Carolina would require public colleges in their state to be accredited by their new accreditor. That would undermine the current requirement that colleges get to choose their own accreditor.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard, Duke, Stanford and other wealthy universities are hoping to avoid a huge potential tax hike by pitching an alternative plan to Congress: a pledge to spend more of their own money\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/colleges-hope-to-stave-off-big-tax-hike-by-pledging-to-spend-more-endowment-cash-353606fb?st=FTbBSQ&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(They will spend 5% of their endowments.

He should increase it.\n\n(He doesn’t, ed.)\n\nIf the United States wants to compete with other countries for manufacturing jobs, our best strategy is to leverage our exceptional university research capabilities to rebuild our manufacturing base.\n\n\nUniversities have long played pivotal roles in building world-class high-tech economies: Stanford University helped make Silicon Valley what it is today by fostering technological excellence in electrical engineering, establishing the Stanford Research Park and educating the founders of startups like Hewlett-Packard. Individuals from universities like M.I.T. and Harvard played central roles in transforming Boston from a center of textile and boot and shoe manufacturing to a health-sciences hub by starting the world’s first modern venture capital fund to commercialize academic research.\n\n\nCarnegie Mellon University helped revitalize Pittsburgh through targeted investments in computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics, coupled with strategic initiatives to bolster local entrepreneurship. The University of Texas at Austin mobilized local business and political leaders to transform Austin into a leading high-tech region. In all of these cases, universities led efforts to reposition their regional economies toward high-tech sectors such as computers, software, biotechnology and robotics.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump preparing large-scale cancellation of federal funding for California, sources say | CNN Politics\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/06/06/politics/trump-california-federal-funding\n(Could just be a feint, but…)\n\nJust last month, he threatened to withhold federal funding from California over a transgender athlete’s participation in a sporting event — the latest example of the president trying to use funding as leverage to enact his agenda.

The president and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have also publicly feuded for years.\n\n\nHigher education in the state could be hit hard by Trump’s move.

Vehicles transporting the test papers — classified as state secrets — are equipped with video surveillance. Copies of the test are stored in steel-reinforced rooms that can only be opened by three people, each wielding their own key. China made cheating on exams a criminal act in 2015 — punishable in some cases by prison sentences.\n\n\nThis year, AI companies joined in, adding a new layer to the ring of walls and moats around the exam.\n\n\nChinese AI model DeepSeek did not allow users to upload photos of test papers during the same period….AI tool Kimi allowed photo recognition on Tuesday, but uploading failed when it detected a test exam or paper. Doubao, the AI app owned by TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, appeared to suspend the uploading of test paper photos or screenshots, though other photos worked fine.\n\n\nThis year, some schools in China used real-time AI patrol and surveillance systems to check for suspicious behavior in the exam room: whispering, peeking, passing objects, answering early or using prohibited tools, Chinese state media outlets reported. It can detect the behavior during the exam and with a “post-exam intelligent search,” a Global Times article said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

    "text": "NYTimes: Harvard’s Battle Is Familiar to a University the Right Forced into Exile\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/08/us/trump-harvard-hungary-orban-george-soros.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAs the Trump administration escalates its pressure campaign, more people in American higher education — and in Vienna — believe the U.S. government is borrowing from a playbook refined in recent years by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who used state power to menace a university he disdained, upend academic independence and strengthen his ideological grip on Hungary.\n\n\n“At the abstract level, it’s the same,” said Carsten Q. Schneider, a German scholar who has worked for C.E.U. for more than 20 years and will become its interim president and rector in August.\n\n\n“These demands, these requirements, they are a scale of detail that Orban never bothered with,” Tim Crane, a Britain-born philosophy professor, said at C.E.U.\n\n\n“Universities and their allies need to speak up in defense of core values,” she [Amy Gutmann, a political scientist who led the University of Pennsylvania for nearly 18 years and then served as President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s ambassador to Germany] said, adding that “the C.E.U. experience warns against the instinct to make concessions to an administration that’s intent on punishing the political opposition.”\n\n\nIn Mr. Orban’s Hungary, sometimes described as a “propaganda state,” the government transferred control of public universities to foundations — controlled by the ruling party’s allies — and gender studies essentially became a forbidden academic discipline.\n\n\nIn 2017, the Hungarian government, which some prominent figures on the American right have praised, stepped up its effort to undermine the American-accredited university. The campaign was built on legal maneuvering, including a hastily passed law, struck down years later by the European Court of Justice, effectively requiring C.E.U. to open a new campus in the United States.\n\n\nThe university tried to negotiate, but talks with the Hungarian government failed in late 2018. Thousands of Hungarians protested the government’s tactics that year — “Even Voldemort didn’t kick Hogwarts out,” read one sign — but C.E.U. said it had no choice but to leave.\n\n\nEva Kiser, a museum studies student at C.E.U. who is from Knoxville, Tenn., said she had been counting on political firewalls in the United States to hold and that things would “blow over.”\n\n\n“But that’s not really looking probable,” she said.\n\n\n“Don’t expect mercy, or that this is normal and you need to sort of be nice and then they come to their senses,” Dr. Schneider, the incoming interim rector, said. “It is unhinged. …”\n\n\nBorrowing an idea from the economist Albert O. Hirschman, Professor Dorsch, an American, said universities had three options: leave, obey the government or speak up.\n\n(Lots of salient quotes here, an article well worth reading, as the mafia state has learned some things from the propaganda state.)\n\nNotes from an Occupation\n\nhttps://www.nybooks.com/articles/2025/06/26/notes-from-an-occupation-marilynne-robinson/\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nA well-planned occupation seizes the heights of the defeated civilization, so that the people will see their leaders ousted or humiliated and made docile. It will likewise discredit and weaken those features of the culture in which its people placed confidence and pride. If this model were applied to our situation, we might expect to see the Supreme Court diminished, the Congress disempowered, and the Constitution desacralized by indifference or contempt. The press would come under attack. Our incomparable universities and research institutions would lose autonomy and resources. The mighty dollar would be weakened. Bonds with allies would be breached, and the occupied country would be held in contempt for the damage its default had done to the world order, and to democracy, having put aside its responsibility for demonstrating the viability of popular government.\n\n\nExamples of the seizing of cultural heights abound. In 70 AD the Romans utterly razed the Temple at Jerusalem and Jerusalem itself in order to deal with the Jewish population’s resistance to their oppression. In 1814 the British, still wanting to break the back of the Revolution, burned the American Capitol Building, destroying the Library of Congress.\n\n\nI am proposing, of course, that America actually is, at present, an occupied country. I will call the occupiers Red and the occupied Blue, since these colors are in general use for distinctions of this kind and seemingly cause no offense.\n\n(More behind a paywall, I’m sure)",

Some of the groups involved include OEDP, the Data Rescue Project, Safeguarding Research and Culture, the Internet Archive, the End of Term Archive, and the Data.gov Archive, which is run by the Harvard Law School Library.\n\n\n… “That took time,” Richards said, noting that not every data set and its accompanying metadata was easy to replicate. “Each varied significantly.

What Now?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/colleges-cant-trust-the-federal-government-what-now\n\nSupport from the federal government has been so consistent and made such good sense that colleges and universities have built their budgets, infrastructure, and programming around the assumption of its permanence. Trump 2.0 has shown what happens when the government does not behave sensibly and has turned an essential lifeline into an existential risk.\n\n\nThe scorched-earth assault on Harvard University is generating all the headlines, but it might in fact be drawing attention away from an even larger story: the tectonic shift in the future activities and financial underpinnings of American higher education and the even greater risk to institutions that have neither Harvard’s resources nor Harvard’s reputation.\n\n\nEven if universities manage to muddle through Trump’s vindictive irrationality, can they return to building budget models that assume consistently high levels of federal support? JD Vance is waiting in the wings, and who knows what new Trumps and Vances the future might bring?\n\n\nA small group of the most prestigious and selective universities might be able to substitute affluent domestic students for affluent international students at the undergraduate level, though even those institutions would likely have trouble doing so for master’s-degree programs, where costs are high and return on investment can be questionable. For most colleges, such a substitution would be impossible and tuition revenue would necessarily decline. Subtract the full-paying international students from the applicant pool and an already fragile financial structure would begin very quickly to collapse.\n\n\nFor the ideologues driving the administration’s policies on education and immigration — Linda McMahon and Kristi Noem are not the brains behind this operation — the destructive effects of these various policies are very much the point. None of the consequences we are seeing are unintended.\n\n\nDevastating scientific research and systematically undermining the preeminence of American universities — like so many of the actions of the Trump administration — represents a triumph of vindictiveness and nihilism over sound public policy. But here we are, about to see how quickly and adroitly the embattled and change-resistant world of higher education can adapt to a future in which the government cannot be trusted.\n\n\n\n\n\nCiting Ohio’s SB 1, College Refuses to Sign Union Contract\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/labor-unionization/2025/06/12/citing-ohios-sb-1-college-refuses-sign-union\n\nUnited Faculty of Central Ohio Technical College union members and their institution are both citing state law in a dispute over whether the institution must sign a new collective bargaining agreement—or gut provisions it agreed to earlier in order to comply with the state’s sweeping new public higher education law.",

Multiple states have considered GOP bills targeting shared governance, but SB 37 is a sweeping example.\n\n\nIf a college or university board decides to keep a faculty governing body, the institution’s president gets to prescribe how it conducts meetings. The president also gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary.”\n\n\nIn addition, unless the college or university’s board decides otherwise, faculty senates and councils must shrink to no more than 60 members.\n\n\nIn another blow to faculty control of their own governance bodies, SB 37 establishes term limits for faculty senate and council members—and allows presidential appointees to serve longer than the elected members.\n\n(Two years, then a two year break)\n\nA faculty senate or council member could also have their seat stripped at any time; the bill says the provost can recommend to the president that members be “immediately removed” for failing to attend meetings or conduct their “responsibilities within the council’s or senate’s parameters” or for “similar misconduct.”\n\n(Will this be a national template if Abbott signs this bill? The reporting attributes the bill to one legislator, but I doubt their office drafted it.)\n\nTrump Ends Vital Higher Ed Data System Training\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/09/department-education-discontinues-ipeds-training\n\nUsed to track trends in higher education enrollment, completion, financial aid usage and other institutional characteristics, IPEDS survey data has long been critical to higher education research. But in order to access and utilize the data, institutions need to know how to properly complete the survey and researchers need to know how to navigate the database.\n\n\nProject 2025 Author to Work at Education Department\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/09/project-2025-author-work-education-department\n\nThe Trump administration announced Friday that Lindsey Burke, the director of the Center for Education Policy at the Heritage Foundation, will be the department’s deputy chief of staff for policy and programs. Burke also authored the Education Department chapter of Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint that called for sweeping changes to higher education policy, from privatizing student loans to rolling back LGBTQ+ protections in Title IX.\n\n\nExclusive | Leaders of CUNY, other college antisemitism hotbeds to be grilled by House panel next month\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2025/06/09/us-news/leaders-of-cuny-other-college-antisemitism-hotbeds-to-be-grilled-by-house-panel-next-month/\n(No need to click through.

Both would cap graduate loans, open up the Pell Grant program to short-term programs and cut all but one option for income-driven loan repayment.\n\n\nMost notably, the Senate bill does not include a limit on traditional Pell Grant eligibility that would have excluded thousands of part-time students, as the House version did, and it walks back the House’s controversial risk-sharing plan, which would force colleges to pay a penalty based on students’ unpaid loans.\n\n\nRepublicans are keen on college sports legislation.

Now Trump May Force Him Out.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/07/us/trump-harvard-international-student-ban.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFive weeks later, just after the end of the spring semester, Mr. Williamson [rom Wales], now at a summer abroad program, picked up his phone and saw a pileup of missed calls and messages. The threat his friends had dismissed had become a searing reality: The federal government had effectively blocked Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students — abruptly thrusting Mr. Williamson and others into an excruciating limbo.\n\n\nHe had arrived in Cambridge, Mass., intent on studying physics, drawn to its broad range of useful applications in other sciences. Then, during his first semester, he found a new passion — in a politics course taught by Steven Levitsky, the author of the best-selling book “How Democracies Die,” that featured a deep dive into authoritarianism. After that, Mr. Williamson planned to become a double major in physics and government. Maybe someday, he thought, he would make his own foray into politics or public service.\n\n\n“It was the best year of my life,” he said.\n\n\nIn recent weeks, long-simmering Republican anger over Harvard’s links to China has increasingly gained traction\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/world/china/harvards-china-ties-become-new-front-in-battle-with-trump-6eb24947?st=D2uR9P&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(There is always something to stir up republican anger…)\n\nTrump indicated that his concern about the Xinjiang corps was based on findings of a House Select Committee on China. Its chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar (R., Mich.), late last month wrote to Harvard President Alan Garber, demanding explanations about university activities that “create risks to U.S. national security and further the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) genocide in Xinjiang.”\n\n\nIn Public, Harvard Is Fighting Trump. Quietly, It’s Dismantling a Program the White House Doesn’t Like.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/in-public-harvard-is-fighting-trump-quietly-its-dismantling-a-program-the-white-house-doesnt-like\n\nHarvard University has spent the last year slowly dismantling a religious-studies program that critics said was biased against Israel, five current and former university employees told The Chronicle. Last week, the final hammer fell: The five remaining staff members employed by the Religion and Public Life program were called, one by one, into meetings with a representative from Harvard’s human-resources department and the program’s interim director, David F. Holland. There, all learned their contracts would not be renewed.\n\n\nThe program puts out a “wide range” of events and courses, McKanan said. But since the October 7 attacks, the program’s teaching around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has drawn criticism from those who argue Harvard’s campus is a hotbed of antisemitism.\n\n\nIn an internal report on antisemitism published in April, a task force of professors, students, and advisers had suggested that a lack of rigor among “nonladder” faculty at Harvard was partly to blame for programs and events that task-force members characterized as antisemitic. The task force recommended tenured Harvard faculty members exercise greater oversight of programs.\n\n\nNonladder — or non-tenure-track — faculty deliver about half of the curriculum at the Divinity School, said McKanan, who has a nonladder contract and has been at Harvard for 17 years. “When Harvard chooses to rely on nonladder faculty,” he said, “it becomes a little bit strange and unnatural to exclude that half of the faculty from program leadership and from sponsoring public events on issues of urgent public concern.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Rubio Is Pressing to Open Sanctions Investigation Into Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/politics/rubio-is-pressing-to-open-sanctions-investigation-into-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(More weaponization of the federal government, err “Trump administration’s whole-of-government approach to bringing the Ivy League university to heel.”)\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is pushing to investigate whether Harvard University violated federal sanctions by collaborating on a health insurance conference in China that may have included officials blacklisted by the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The New York Times.\n\n\nMr. Trump and his allies appear determined [hell-bent] to upend nearly all aspects of the institution, which has long symbolized the pinnacle of higher learning in the country and attracted influential scholars from around the globe.\n\n(And here we see the fingerprints of the Manhattan Institute)\n\nStill, the X.P.C.C.’s involvement in the conference only recently gained attention from Trump allies, after a report about Harvard’s links to China published on April 22 by Strategy Risks, a New York-based intelligence company specializing in corporate exposure to China. The report was funded by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank that has advised Republican policymakers.\n\n\nNYTimes: What Happens if ‘Harvard Is Not Harvard’?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/us/harvard-funding-trump-administration.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n“Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” school officials wrote in a lawsuit asking a judge to stop the federal government’s actions.\n\n\nIt left unsaid what Harvard, if it were no longer Harvard, would become.\n\n\nBut without federal dollars or international talent, experts say, Harvard could fall out of the top tier for research, where it currently sits with competitors like Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. By sheer dollars spent, its research budget could shrink to something similar to that of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, which spent just over $800 million on research in 2023, roughly half of what Harvard spends now.\n\n\nHarvard could choose to negotiate. But inside the university, officials appear reluctant to do that, given the backlash they could face for capitulating to Mr. Trump. This spring, the university took out $750 million in debt, giving it some cash flow as court decisions play out.\n\n\nThe atmosphere is particularly tense inside the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which relies on federal funding for 46 percent of its budget and has a student body that is about 40 percent international. Senior officials there are planning for the worst, and have called the potential changes an “existential crisis” for the school’s future.\n\n\nBut Harvard’s biggest source of funding is donations and payouts from its endowment, which together make up 45 percent of its revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Indiana U., Professors Spar With Administrators Over Nighttime Protests\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/at-indiana-u-professors-spar-with-administrators-over-nighttime-protests\n\nUnder a policy passed in response to a monthslong pro-Palestinian encampment at Indiana, certain forms of “expressive activity” — including holding protests, making speeches, and circulating petitions — were banned on campus between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Administrators argued that the changes were necessary to ensure safety after the encampment got out of hand.\n\n\nThe policy banned protests between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., required 10-day prior approval for installing “structures and/or mass physical objects,” and pushed protests 25 feet away from building entrances.\n\n\nStudents and staff sued over the policy. In late May, a federal judge temporarily blocked the nighttime restrictions.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the political climate surrounding the university remains contentious. Last week, Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, removed the three alumni-elected trustees from Indiana’s board — including two who voted against the expressive-activity policy — and replaced them with conservatives, including a prominent lawyer and a former ESPN anchor.\n\n\nTexas lawmakers just approved legislation broadly banning “any speech or expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment” between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. at public universities. The measure now awaits the governor’s signature.\n\n\nBut Indiana’s expressive-activity policy never specified how many nighttime protesters were too many. That meant even a protest involving two people — unlikely to be a threat to public safety — would require prior approval, the judge said in her order granting the preliminary injunction.\n\n\nWhile the decision was far from “novel or surprising,” it will hopefully send a message to universities imposing similar policies that “the courts are not going to put up with this kind of similarly open violation of the First Amendment and so they probably shouldn’t try it,” said Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the George Washington University Law School.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump Administration Proposes Cutting Tribal College Funds by Nearly 90% — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/tribal-colleges-universities-trump-cuts-funding\n\nThe Trump administration has proposed cutting funding for tribal colleges and universities by nearly 90%, a move that would likely shut down most or all of the institutions created to serve students disadvantaged by the nation’s historic mistreatment of Indigenous communities.\n\n\nThe document mentions only the two federally controlled tribal colleges — Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute — but notes the request for postsecondary programs will drop from more than $182 million this year to just over $22 million for 2026.\n\n\nInside UNC’s Effort to Launch a New Accreditor\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/accreditation/2025/06/06/emails-shed-light-uncs-plans-create-new-accreditor\n\nLast month, Peter Hans, president of the University of North Carolina system, casually dropped a bombshell announcement that the system and others were in talks to launch a new accreditor.\n\n\n“We’ve been having a number of discussions with several other major public university systems, where we’re exploring the idea of creating an accreditor that would offer sound oversight,” Hans said at a UNC system Board of Governors meeting last month, The News & Observer reported.\n\n\nhave been quietly engaged in conversations about launching a new accreditor for at least a year, including discussions with unnamed collaborators in Florida, where the effort could be headquartered. UNC officials have also spoken with officials at the U.S. Department of Education, even getting a heads-up on what an April 23 executive order from the Trump administration on accreditation would entail.\n\n\n“Everything Florida has done on accreditation over the past few years appears to be politically and ideologically driven, rather than about what is best for students and ensuring that they go to high-quality institutions and get a good education when they’re paying a lot of money for it and when taxpayers are investing a lot of money in public funding for higher education,” he said [Edward Conroy, a senior policy manager at the left-leaning think tank New America].\n\n\nConroy worries that state lawmakers in either Florida or North Carolina would require public colleges in their state to be accredited by their new accreditor. That would undermine the current requirement that colleges get to choose their own accreditor.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard, Duke, Stanford and other wealthy universities are hoping to avoid a huge potential tax hike by pitching an alternative plan to Congress: a pledge to spend more of their own money\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/colleges-hope-to-stave-off-big-tax-hike-by-pledging-to-spend-more-endowment-cash-353606fb?st=FTbBSQ&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(They will spend 5% of their endowments. At CUNY the cap is 4% and some campuses spend less than this.)",

The number of Americans doing study abroad programs in China peaked at nearly 15,000 in 2011, before plummeting to 211 during the pandemic, when visa restrictions and rippling covid lockdowns made it hard for foreigners to enter the country.\n\n\nU.S. Curb on Chinese Students a Boon for Asian Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/2025/06/10/us-curbs-chinese-students-boon-asian-universities\n\n“We’re not seeing sensationalist headlines in the media, and many families are watching and waiting for the final policy outcome and specific rules from the State Department,” he said. “There is an increasing awareness that the administration’s policies often start with big headlines of assertive nationalist policy, but they often end up being mitigated, reduced or overturned altogether.”\n\n\nHongqing Yang, managing director of the Hong Kong–based consultancy The Educationist, said the Chinese government is likely “to encourage domestic institutions, including those in Hong Kong and Macao, as well as transnational education institutions and joint programs, to accommodate more students” in the wake of the news.\n\n\nIn Hong Kong, the government explicitly encouraged universities to enroll Harvard students following the news.\n\n\nLaurie Pearcey, adviser to the president and college master at the University of Hong Kong Shenzhen, described the situation as a “free kick for Hong Kong.”\n\n\nNYTimes: Red-State Universities Will Get Hit by Trump’s Cuts, Too\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/opinion/trump-harvard-scientific-research.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nRather than striking a blow for red-state America, these cuts would actually take a heavy toll on many of the communities in states that went for Mr. Trump in the last election — whose research universities serve as crucial anchors for industry and innovation.\n\n\nIf Mr. Trump wants to make all of America great again, he shouldn’t cut funding for scientific research. He should increase it.\n\n(He doesn’t, ed.)\n\nIf the United States wants to compete with other countries for manufacturing jobs, our best strategy is to leverage our exceptional university research capabilities to rebuild our manufacturing base.\n\n\nUniversities have long played pivotal roles in building world-class high-tech economies: Stanford University helped make Silicon Valley what it is today by fostering technological excellence in electrical engineering, establishing the Stanford Research Park and educating the founders of startups like Hewlett-Packard. Individuals from universities like M.I.T. and Harvard played central roles in transforming Boston from a center of textile and boot and shoe manufacturing to a health-sciences hub by starting the world’s first modern venture capital fund to commercialize academic research.\n\n\nCarnegie Mellon University helped revitalize Pittsburgh through targeted investments in computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics, coupled with strategic initiatives to bolster local entrepreneurship. The University of Texas at Austin mobilized local business and political leaders to transform Austin into a leading high-tech region. In all of these cases, universities led efforts to reposition their regional economies toward high-tech sectors such as computers, software, biotechnology and robotics.",

Here’s Your ChatGPT.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/07/technology/chatgpt-openai-colleges.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nTo spread chatbots on campuses, OpenAI is selling premium A.I. services to universities for faculty and student use. It is also running marketing campaigns aimed at getting students who have never used chatbots to try ChatGPT.\n\n\nOpenAI’s campaign is part of an escalating A.I. arms race among tech giants to win over universities and students with their chatbots. The company is following in the footsteps of rivals like Google and Microsoft that have for years pushed to get their computers and software into schools, and court students as future customers.\n\n(Big tech’s continued attempts to wrest control of education from the professoriate)\n\nOpenAI’s push to A.I.-ify college education amounts to a national experiment on millions of students. The use of these chatbots in schools is so new that their potential long-term educational benefits, and possible side effects, are not yet established.\n\n\nA few early studies have found that outsourcing tasks like research and writing to chatbots can diminish skills like critical thinking. And some critics argue that colleges going all-in on chatbots are glossing over issues like societal risks, A.I. labor exploitation and environmental costs.\n\n\nChinese AI firms block features amid high-stakes university entrance exams\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/10/china-exam-gaokao-ai-cheating-test/\n\nAs more than 13 million students filed into rooms across China to sit for the notoriously grueling, high-stakes gaokao college entrance exam, they already faced strict anti-cheating and real-time surveillance measures, including facial recognition technology, metal detectors, drones and cellphone-signal blockers. Vehicles transporting the test papers — classified as state secrets — are equipped with video surveillance. Copies of the test are stored in steel-reinforced rooms that can only be opened by three people, each wielding their own key. China made cheating on exams a criminal act in 2015 — punishable in some cases by prison sentences.\n\n\nThis year, AI companies joined in, adding a new layer to the ring of walls and moats around the exam.\n\n\nChinese AI model DeepSeek did not allow users to upload photos of test papers during the same period….AI tool Kimi allowed photo recognition on Tuesday, but uploading failed when it detected a test exam or paper. Doubao, the AI app owned by TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, appeared to suspend the uploading of test paper photos or screenshots, though other photos worked fine.\n\n\nThis year, some schools in China used real-time AI patrol and surveillance systems to check for suspicious behavior in the exam room: whispering, peeking, passing objects, answering early or using prohibited tools, Chinese state media outlets reported. It can detect the behavior during the exam and with a “post-exam intelligent search,” a Global Times article said.",

    "text": "Dear All,\nPlease find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.\nA week marked by more efforts to radically change higher education, this week by denying foreign students the ability to study in the US and in particular Harvard (though we now know what TRO means – temporary restraining order)\nThanks BE, EST for sharing!\n\n\n\nUFS Blog on Alliances\n\nhttps://www1.cuny.edu/sites/cunyufs/2025/06/03/faculty-batten-down-and-arm-up-with-compacts/\n(Thanks BE for this!)\n\nStand Together for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.standtogetherhighered.org/\n(Thanks EST)\n\nHigher education is under attack. A coordinated political campaign is working to delegitimize universities, restrict what can be taught, punish open inquiry, and dismantle institutional autonomy. These efforts are already causing real harm—targeting international students, undermining financial aid, making it harder for many to access or afford a college education, and defunding life-enhancing research. They threaten the values that make higher education vital to democracy: free speech, academic freedom, inclusion, and the pursuit of knowledge. To protect those values, we must come together—across campuses, communities, and differences—in common cause.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Alarmed by Trump Cuts, Scientists Are Talking Science. For 100 Hours.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/climate/science-livestream-budget-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDr. Rind’s presentation was the first of many in a planned, 100-hour-long livestream featuring hundreds of climate scientists and meteorologists from across the United States. They are protesting cuts to funding for atmospheric science and calling out potential risks to weather forecasts. The livestream started on Wednesday and is scheduled to run continuously through June 1, the first day of the Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Is a Summer to Organize (opinion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/06/03/summer-organize-opinion\n\nFaculty may long for a break, but the government is actively operationalizing Project 2025, a blueprint for remaking every public institution, with higher education being the crown jewel of its antidemocratic agenda. At his 100-day rally in Michigan, Donald Trump declared, “We’ve just gotten started. You haven’t even seen anything yet.” Christopher Rufo, architect of the right-wing culture war, promises to plunge higher education still further into “an existential terror.”\n\n\nWe should be prepared for a potential wave of coordinated assaults on higher education this summer: reductions in Pell Grant eligibility for low-income students and slashed student loans, more dismantlement of scientific research funding, politicized accreditation crackdowns, new endowment taxes, expanded intimidation of international students and scholars, and further weaponization of Title VI and Title IX enforcement.\n\n\nWe recommend mobilizing on two simultaneous fronts this summer: by operationalizing mutual academic defense compacts (MADCs), and through direct activism. We must forge powerful alliances for mass protest. We suggest one often-overlooked but deeply strategic constituency— veterans.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademia’s Holy Warriors\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/academias-holy-warriors/\n\nThe idea is central to Deneen’s [Notre Dame political-science professor] argument in Why Liberalism Failed, which announces America’s failed — past tense — liberal tradition. For Deneen, “liberalism” refers not just to the political beliefs of self-identified liberals or progressives, but also to the broader, rights-based political philosophy that has guided both major political parties for most of American history.\n\n\nAs Deneen was speaking, blueberry pie was served to an audience that included Rod Dreher, the well-known American Conservative blogger and author of The Benedict Option; Matthew Schmitz, an editor of the ecumenical religious journal First Things; and Bria Sandford, editorial director of Penguin’s right-of-center Sentinel book division. The next morning, the New York Times columnist Ross Douthat arrived\n\n\nIn the year and a half since the conference, other writers who have staked out public positions on the nonliberal right include the Harvard law professor Adrian Vermeule, the First Things editor R.R. Reno, the former Washington Examiner managing editor Helen Andrews, and the University of Dallas assistant professor of political science — and deputy editor of the journal American Affairs — Gladden Pappin. One might add Mary Ann Glendon, the Harvard law professor and former ambassador to the Vatican, who in July was named the head of President Trump’s Commission on Unalienable Rights.\n\n\nThe radicals, on the other hand, were those who believed that American liberalism had always been deeply hostile to the core values of Catholics.\n\n\nHarvard Law professor Adrian Vermeule accused Deneen of failing to grapple fully with the consequences of his own diagnosis. … What was needed was not the creation of new societies — which would survive only at the forbearance of the reigning powers — but a coup against the liberal “imperium” from within. … Rather than withdrawing from the power centers of liberal society, Vermeule recommends that administrators and other elites find a “strategic position” from which, as dissatisfaction with liberalism grows, they can turn that bureaucracy to “new ends.”\n\n(Deenan also raises the ire of David Brooks:)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/opinion/trump-vance-morality.html\n\nParks, libraries, museums: here’s why Trump is attacking America’s best-loved institutions | Margaret Sullivan | The Guardian\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/02/national-parks-libraries-museums-trump\n\nIt seems counterintuitive, but this is all a part of a broad plan that the great 20th-century political thinker Hannah Arendt would have understood all too well.\n\n\nTake away natural beauty, free access to books and support for the arts, and you end up with a less enlightened, more ignorant and less engaged public. That’s a public much more easily manipulated.\n\n\n“A people that can no longer believe in anything cannot make up its mind,” said Arendt, a student of authoritarianism, in 1973. Eventually, such a public “is deprived … of its ability to think and judge”, and with people like that, “you can then do what you please”.\n\n\n\n\n\nRed states tell colleges: Race and gender classes are out, civics in\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/02/republican-state-laws-university-college-classes/\n\nNew laws in Ohio, Utah and Florida are reshaping general education, the core classes college students take to meet graduation requirements. The laws mandate that students take civics courses focused on Western civilization and bar classes centered on race or gender from counting toward core requirements.\n\n\nState lawmakers have the authority to regulate curriculums and set requirements for graduation, but higher education experts say that until recently, they have let public colleges and universities lead the way. That began to change in 2020 after the first Trump administration issued an executive order to stamp out “divisive concepts” about race and gender in the federal government, according to the American Association of University Professors and American Federation of Teachers.\n\n\n“This is a new type of local intervention,” said Keith E. Whittington, founding chair of the Academic Committee of the Academic Freedom Alliance. “Some of the proposals are making more elaborate interventions about what the curriculum ought to look like and are also increasingly interested in the content.”\n\n\nHouse Democrats Air Grievances With McMahon\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/05/mcmahon-faces-angry-house-democrats\n\nThe Trump administration has recently criticized what it sees as a lack of viewpoint diversity at Harvard University and demanded that the institution hire more conservative professors if it would like to regain access to federal grant funding. At a Senate hearing Tuesday, McMahon said a federal law that prevents discrimination based on race and national origin gave the department the authority to make such demands.\n\n\nTakano [California Democrat] snapped back, saying, “I think it’s pretty clear you haven’t thought through this idea of viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\nNYTimes: A Professor Was Fired for Her Politics. Is That the Future of Academia?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/magazine/academic-freedom-politics.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut that night, reading Kanazi’s words while taking in the news, she felt a pitch of fury and despair at the rising number of dead in Gaza and her sense that too few Americans were similarly horrified. She believed in her right to state her beliefs and share those of others, like Kanazi, with whom she sympathized. Besides, the post would disappear from her Instagram stories by the following evening.\n\n\nTwo days later, on a Friday, Finkelstein got an email from Jennifer Storm, the director of equity and Title IX at Muhlenberg, asking her to come to a meeting the following Monday — with a lawyer if she wanted one.\n\n\nBut the meeting, which took place a week later on Zoom with Finkelstein’s lawyer present, was entirely about her repost. Finkelstein was told not to return to campus and locked out of her email. Her classes would be reassigned to an adjunct professor while the college hired an outside firm to investigate.\n\n\nThe investigation stretched over the spring semester. Then, in May, Finkelstein received a new letter from the college: She was being fired, with cause. This despite her having tenure, a historic form of academic job protection meant to insulate scholars from the steamrolling power of both politics and public opinion. Less noticed at the time, but arguably more prophetic, was how the mechanics of her firing trammeled yet another longtime standard in the academy, that of professors’ deciding among themselves when and if a colleague should be fired.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration’s big week of gaslighting and censorship\n\nhttps://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-free-speech-harvard-marco-rubio-rfk-jr-censorship-rcna209870\n\nOver the course of the past week alone — in the name of academic, scientific and online “freedom” — Trump and his administration’s bigwigs have explicitly threatened free speech in at least a half-dozen different ways.\n\n\nNYTimes: A Student at Brown Channeled Elon Musk. Then He Got in Trouble.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/brown-university-newspaper-musk-doge.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThousands of administrative employees at Brown University woke up this spring to an email with pointed Elon Musk-like questions about their job responsibilities.\n\n\nPlease describe your role, it asked. What tasks have you performed in the past week? How would Brown students be affected if your job didn’t exist?\n\n\nThe March 18 email was from a sophomore, Alex Shieh, who explained that the responses would be included in a story for The Brown Spectator, a new, as yet unpublished conservative newspaper on campus.\n\n\nTwo days later, Brown notified Mr. Shieh that he was under investigation for possible violations of the university’s code of student conduct, including its prohibitions on invasion of privacy, misrepresentation and emotional or psychological harm.\n\n\nWith that, his case — and that of two Spectator students who were later placed under investigation — became the latest flashpoint in the free speech wars on American college campuses.\n\n\nBrown eventually cleared all three students of wrongdoing. But their case is yet another example of how universities continue to struggle with protecting the rights of students to express themselves on campus, after years of trying to adjudicate just when political expression tips into harassment.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Attacks on Black History Betray America\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/opinion/black-history-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration’s framing of Black history as “D.E.I.” — and “D.E.I.” as harming white Americans — recasts its attack on Black history as protecting white Americans. As administering justice. Which is the justification of nearly every Klan and racist mob attack in history. The justification of the Atlanta attack in 1906.\n\n\nOpinion | Here are the people Trump is trying to delete\n\nhttps://wapo.st/3Hs6XZb\n(Sexism too)\n\nAbout 80 percent of the erased images contained one or more targeted keywords, such as gay, transgender, women, Hispanic and Black.\n\n\nEntire demographics are being scrubbed from records of both America’s past and present — including people of color, transgender people, women, immigrants and people with disabilities. They are now among America’s “missing persons.”\n\n\nPeople who aren’t White are an especially frequent target of government erasure.\n\n\nWomen (alongside racial minorities) have been disproportionately fired in purges of National Institutes of Health science review boards and senior military leadership positions. A landmark study on women’s health — the Women’s Health Initiative — was canceled entirely in April, though eventually restored after significant public outcry. The Labor Department likewise canceled grants for women’s apprenticeship programs last week.\n\n\nMore broadly, the terms “woman” and “women” have also appeared on banned-word lists for federal agency websites, grant applications and other external communications, including at the National Science Foundation and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttacks on Chinese Students Could Wreak Havoc on Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/05/30/trump-targets-chinese-students-harsh-blow-higher\n\nThe targeting of students in “critical fields” in particular could devastate STEM programs and research labs at smaller universities across the country, where Chinese international students are heavily represented. Rubio did not clarify what fields could be considered critical, potentially setting the stage for a sweeping focus on areas where GOP lawmakers have raised concerns about sensitive national security research being shared with the Chinese government.\n\n\nAt a press conference yesterday, department spokesperson Tammy Bruce declined to “get into the details” of how the new visa scrutiny would be applied or what “critical fields” the department was referring to, because it “might give up our hand and make certain things less effective.”\n\n\n“‘Aggressively revoking’ visas based on political ideology is a gross violation of basic free expression principles that anchor the academy,” he [Jonathan Friedman, managing director of U.S. free expression at PEN America] wrote to Inside Higher Ed.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/colleges-across-u-s-fear-chill-on-enrollments-of-foreign-students\n\nThe visa-interview suspension capped a week of bad news: The nominee to oversee the student-visa system vowed to end work authorization for recent international graduates, a move that could seriously dent the appeal of American colleges. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned foreign students who had not updated their employment records that they could face deportation. And the Trump administration took the unprecedented step of revoking Harvard University’s authority to enroll international students as part of an all-fronts showdown with one of the nation’s most prestigious institutions. Other colleges could be next, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in announcing the decision: “Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country.”\n\n\nTrump administration claims Chinese students ‘exploit’ U.S. universities\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/01/china-us-students-national-security-threat/\n\nWhat the New Travel Ban Means for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-the-new-travel-ban-means-for-higher-ed\n\nAnd taken together, the two proclamations underscore the extent to which international students are simultaneously in the crosshairs of two of the most contentious and virulent issues of the Trump presidency, its opposition to immigration and its fight to force higher education to bend to government’s agenda.\n\n\nRestrictions on international students are a powerful lever to use against colleges, many of which have come to rely on the higher tuition paid by foreign students in a time of leaner budgets and domestic demographic declines. At the graduate level, visa holders are the backbone of American research and science.\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Ends In-State Tuition for Undocumented Students\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/05/texas-ends-state-tuition-undocumented-students\n\nThousands of undocumented students in Texas no longer have access to in-state tuition. The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state on Wednesday over its policy of allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at public universities. Within hours, Texas sided with the Justice Department, and U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor granted a permanent injunction, quashing the policy.\n\n\nIn an interview before the permanent injunction, Ahilan Arulanantham, professor from practice at the UCLA School of Law and co-director of the law school’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said he didn’t believe a legal ruling in the Justice Department’s favor would necessarily affect other states, such as California, with similar laws. He said Texas used a residency criterion to decide eligibility for in-state tuition, an approach more vulnerable to legal challenges than some of the criteria other states use.\n\n\nBut even if other states go unscathed, losing in-state tuition benefits is “extraordinarily significant” for the “massive” undocumented population in Texas, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCUNY advocates push for $100M to bridge funding gap and enhance student services\n\nhttps://www.citizenportal.ai/articles/3326181/New-York/CUNY-advocates-push-for-100M-to-bridge-funding-gap-and-enhance-student-services\n(Thanks BE)\n\nScientific Community Fears for Future of STEM Workforce Amid NSF Overhaul\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/05/30/future-stem-workforce-jeopardy-amid-nsf-overhaul\n\nOf the approximately 1,500 grants the agency recently terminated, at least 750 came from the NSF’s education directorate, according to Grant Watch, an independent website that tracks terminated NSF grants. And that’s not the only shake-up happening at the NSF, which Congress created in 1950 to “promote the progress of science; advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; and secure the national defense.” The Trump administration has also laid off staff and proposed slashing the agency’s budget.\n\n\nAdditionally, NSF announced new priorities that include not funding projects aimed at recruiting more Americans from underrepresented backgrounds to the STEM workforce—a key focus for the agency historically.\n\n\nThe Trump administration says all these changes are part of its plan to reform the NSF, correct an alleged “scientific slowdown,” build a “a robust domestic STEM workforce” and “rapidly accelerate its investment in critical and advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology.” The NSF sends billions to colleges and universities to support STEM education and nonmedical scientific research.\n\n\nNYTimes: White House Unveils New Details of Stark Budget Cuts\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/white-house-budget-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe White House budget is not a matter of law. Ultimately, it is up to Congress to determine the budget, and in recent years it has routinely discarded many of the president’s proposals. Lawmakers are only starting to embark on the annual process, with government funding set to expire at the end of September.\n\n\nTargeting the Education Department, the president again put forward a roughly $12 billion cut, seeking to eliminate dozens of programs while unveiling new changes to Pell grants, which help low-income students pay for college.\n\n\nThe maximum award would be capped at $5,710 for the 2026-7 award year, a decrease of more than $1,600.\n\n\nMr. Trump and his budget director, Russell T. Vought, “are clearly hiding their policy goals, because they would hurt the middle class, the working class and the vulnerable,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, who leads her party on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\n\nNew Details of Trump’s Budget Cuts Alarm Researchers\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/03/new-details-trumps-budget-cuts-alarm-researchers\n\nTrump Wants Grant Makers to Become Political Appointees\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/05/trump-policy-moves-make-grant-makers-political\n\nOfficials say the policy, which would make it easier to fire thousands of government employees, is designed to increase accountability. But experts say it would increase corruption and threaten the nation’s health and economy.\n\n\nIn April, the Office of Personnel Management posted to the Federal Register a proposed rule “to increase career employee accountability” by allowing agencies to quickly remove from critical positions employees “who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.” That could include any employee with “substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking,” such as those involved in drafting funding opportunity announcements, evaluating grant applications and recommending or selecting grant recipients.\n\n\n\n\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION FY 2026 Budget Request to Congress\n\nhttps://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/00-NSF-FY26-CJ-Entire-Rollup.pdf\n\n(NSF PROGRAMS TO BROADEN PARTICIPATION (BP)) Total, Broadening Participation Programs FY24 appropriated: $1,613.85M FY26 (Request) $171.31M\n\n(That’s 10.6 percent of the good old days.

From the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated through April, the agency awarded $1.6 billion less compared with the same period last year, a reduction of one-fifth.

But in the case of Fulbright, the administration is acting unilaterally to nix awards for both American and foreign applicants that for decades have been selected jointly, effectively telling other countries that they don’t have final say in the spending of their own funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Dems Grill Trump’s Pick to Lead the Office for Civil Rights\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/sex-gender/2025/06/06/senate-dems-grill-trumps-pick-lead-civil-rights-office\n\n“This administration has fired more than half of the staff at OCR, and President Trump is now asking, in his budget, to slash that by $49 million next year, so explain to me how those firings and that funding cut will help reduce that backlog? I want to understand how you’re going to square that circle,” Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, asked early on in the hearing.\n\n\nRichey is currently senior chancellor for the Florida Department of Education and has twice served in OCR before, including a brief stint as acting secretary of civil rights at the end of Trump’s first term and the beginning of Biden’s presidency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House convenes meeting to brainstorm new Harvard measures - POLITICO\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/30/white-house-convenes-meeting-to-brainstorm-new-harvard-measures-00376782\n\nBut with the low-hanging policy options already underway, the administration knows it will need to get more creative to keep squeezing the school, according to two administration officials and another person familiar with the talks, who like others in the story were granted anonymity to share details of private conversations.\n\n(Quoth AI: In “The Sopranos,” “squeeze” generally refers to a tactic used by Tony Soprano and his associates to financially strain or control an individual or business, often through extortion or manipulation. )\n\nNYTimes: A Stephen Miller Staffer and Tough Talk: Inside Trump’s Latest Attack on Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/politics/harvard-law-review-investigation-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Justice Department opened an investigation into the student-run Harvard Law Review. The startling accusations show how the Trump administration is wielding power in pursuit of its political agenda.\n\n\nIn a series of letters that have not been previously reported, the government also disclosed that it had a “cooperating witness” inside the student-run journal. That witness now works in the White House under Stephen Miller, the architect of the administration’s domestic policy agenda, Trump officials confirmed.\n\n\nBut the aggressive language in the letters from the Justice Department’s two top civil rights lawyers appeared to have overstated the allegations in pursuit of an additional way to punish Harvard. In that way, the episode fits a broader trend in how the administration is wielding federal investigatory powers to impose its political agenda.\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Argues Cutting Off Its Government Funding Is Wasteful\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/harvard-argues-cutting-off-its-government-funding-is-wasteful.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn a court filing on Monday, Harvard University painted a bleak picture for its research enterprise if the funding taken away by the Trump administration is not restored.\n\n\n“The harm would be severe and long lasting,” John H. Shaw, the university’s vice provost for research, wrote in the 17-page declaration that is part of Harvard’s lawsuit against the Trump administration. “Money cannot repair the lost time, talent, and opportunity.”\n\n\nENHANCING NATIONAL SECURITY BY ADDRESSING RISKS AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/enhancing-national-security-by-addressing-risks-at-harvard-university/\n\nA PROCLAMATION\n\n\nCrime rates at Harvard University — including violent crime rates — have drastically risen in recent years. Harvard has failed to discipline at least some categories of conduct violations on campus. Given these facts, it is imperative, in my judgment, that the Federal Government be able to assess and, if necessary, address misconduct and crimes committed by foreign students at Harvard.\n\n(Believe the Clery reports and you won’t conclude the same: https://www.hupd.harvard.edu/sites/g/files/omnuum2276/files/2024-10/2024%20Annual%20Security%20Report%20Cambridge%20Campus%20Clery%20Act%20Criminal%20Statistics_0.pdf)\n\nThese concerns have compelled the Federal Government to conclude that Harvard University is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student and exchange visitor programs.\n\n\nConsidering these facts [sp? ed.], I have determined that it is necessary to restrict the entry of foreign nationals who seek to enter the United States solely or principally to participate in a course of study at Harvard University or in an exchange visitor program hosted by Harvard University.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Pushes to Restrict Harvard’s International Students From Entering U.S.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-student-visas.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nTrump proclamation seeks to restrict international students from Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/06/04/harvard-visa-ban-trump-international-students/\n\nPresident Trump suspended Harvard from participating in the student-visa program, effectively prohibiting foreign nationals from attending the nation’s most prominent university\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-issues-proclamation-suspending-foreign-students-at-harvard-e62859c4?st=oJDxth&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nMOTION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER\n\nhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.285083/gov.uscourts.mad.285083.56.0.pdf\n\nThis suit challenges the government’s continuing unlawful and retaliatory actions to bar Harvard University from hosting international students and scholars.\n\n\nORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER\n\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25964963-harvardtrotwo060525/\n\nFor purposes of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b), the President and Fellows ofHarvard College (“Plaintiff”) has made a sufficient showing that it has provided notice toDefendants Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, Immigration and CustomsEnforcement, Todd Lyons, Department of Justice, Pamela Bondi, Student and Exchange VisitorProgram, Jim Hicks, Department of State, and Marco Rubio (collectively, “Defendants”) and that,unless its Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”), [ECF No. 56 (the “Motion”)],is granted, it will sustain immediate and irreparable injury before there is an opportunity to hearfrom all parties.\n\n\nNYTimes: Judge Temporarily Blocks Trump’s Order Curtailing Foreign Students at Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/us/harvard-response-trump-international-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\nTrump Escalates Attack on Columbia University by Threatening Its Accreditation - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/nyregion/columbia-trump-accreditation-civil-rights.html\n(Damned if you do, damned if you don’t)\n\nThe federal Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, which two weeks ago found that Columbia violated civil rights laws by “acting with deliberate indifference” toward the harassment of Jewish students, sent a letter on Wednesday to the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the nongovernmental organization that accredits Columbia.\n\n\nThe letter said that because Columbia was in violation of federal anti-discrimination laws, the Education Department believes it fails to meet the standards for accreditation.\n\n\n“University accreditors have an obligation to ensure member institutions abide by their standards,” Linda McMahon, the federal education secretary, said in a news release. She said the government looked forward to being “fully informed of actions taken to ensure Columbia’s compliance with accreditation standards, including compliance with federal civil rights laws.”\n\n\nPresident Trump has described the accreditation process as his “secret weapon” to force ideological changes at universities. But the Trump administration does not have direct control over which universities are accredited. Instead, those decisions are made by nongovernmental organizations certified by the government, in a complex process meant to insulate universities from political interference.\n\n\nNo, Trump Is Not Pulling Columbia’s Accreditation. Here’s What You Need to Know.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/no-trump-is-not-pulling-columbias-accreditation-heres-what-you-need-to-know\n\nIn terms of individual colleges, the federal government has no direct authority to interpret an accreditor’s standards, said John R. Przypyszny, a lawyer who specializes in accreditation. So Trump alone can’t revoke Columbia’s accreditation, which would cut off access to federal financial aid.\n\n\nThe Education Department’s letter, sent Wednesday, argued that Columbia has violated the standards of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.\n\n\nBecause Columbia failed to adequately respond to antisemitic behavior during protests against the war in Gaza, the department’s Office for Civil Rights concluded last month, the institution has violated Title VI, which bars discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared Jewish ancestry. Therefore, the letter continues, Columbia “fails to meet the standards for accreditation,” the department said in a news release. In light of that, the department said, the Middle States Commission must require the university to “establish a plan to come into compliance.”\n\n\nNYTimes: To Bolster Columbia Inquiry, Prosecutor Likened Hamas Graffiti to Cross Burning\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/columbia-protester-hamas-cross.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Justice Department, intent on pursuing a criminal case against student protesters at Columbia University, argued that graffiti with a Hamas symbol outside the home of the school’s interim president threatened her life and was comparable to a racist cross burning, newly unsealed court documents show.\n\n\nThe photo showed graffiti in bright red paint on the building where the university president lived, with the words “free them all” and an inverted triangle.\n\n(How freeing protestors becomes pro-Hamas, I’ll leave for others, but the article mentions an accompanying instagram post.)\n\nThe records also underscore how determined the Trump administration was to press forward with a case judges viewed as weak. Justice Department leaders pushed for an investigation of a student group, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, but federal judges in New York rejected the administration’s efforts to get a search warrant four times, in what some veteran lawyers described as an unusually prolonged disagreement between federal prosecutors and the courts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is saw on bluesky this week\n\n\nIndiana’s governor fired all the elected members of Indiana University’s Board of Trustees.

Faculty were downgraded to “advisory only” roles in university decision-making. Degree programs that graduated too few students would be closed.\n\n\nAnd at Indiana University, whose flagship campus in Bloomington is ranked among the nation’s top 100 schools, the state’s governor was given new power over the school’s governing board.\n\n\nThe moves align with a conservative playbook to reduce faculty power on campuses perceived by many on the right as bastions of liberal thought. This year, several other Republican-led states passed laws requiring reviews for tenured faculty and the reorganization of programs at public institutions that have low enrollment.\n\n\nMany faculty members see the Indiana bill as an attack on their university’s independence and part of an effort to restrict their own freedom to teach and speak. They read Dr. Whitten’s [President of Indiana University] silence as support for the changes.\n\n\nIndiana’s experience has been emblematic of the pressures facing public universities. But several factors — an active protest movement on campus, a state with strong conservative leanings and Dr. Whitten herself, a leader at odds with many on her campus — have created especially tense conditions.\n\n\nDr. Whitten’s administration acted almost immediately. The university called in the Indiana State Police, which stationed snipers on rooftops and arrested 57 people, including a handful of faculty members.\n\n(Snipers!!!)\n\nDr. Whitten and the faculty have long had a frosty relationship. Earlier that spring, more than 800 faculty member approved a vote of no confidence in Dr. Whitten. (More than 3,000 were eligible to vote.)\n\n(Just to be fair, only 948 showed up to be possibly counted https://www.idsnews.com/article/2024/04/behind-the-vote-faculty-lost-confidence-whitten-administration)\n\n\n\n\nUniversities quietly negotiating with White House aide to try to avoid Harvard’s fate, source says | CNN Politics\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/politics/universities-negotiate-trump-administration-harvard\n(So says an anonymous source likely named Stephen Miller)\n\nCollege and university leaders have been privately negotiating with a deputy to top Trump aide Stephen Miller in hopes of avoiding the same aggressive targeting of Harvard University, a person familiar with the matter said, as the administration looks to escalate its attacks on the Ivy League institution and other schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s Attacks Threaten Much More Than Harvard - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/trump-harvard-higher-education-law/682985/\n\nBut the Trump administration’s attack didn’t end there. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s letter announcing this move also doubled as a request for documents, instructing Harvard to deliver five years of video or audio of “any protest activity involving a non-immigrant student,” plus disciplinary files, before the ban will be reconsidered. The next morning, Harvard sued and won a temporary restraining order.\n\n\nThe letter represents the Trump administration’s latest assault in its war on Harvard, in which the government is effectively trying to nationalize a private university.\n\n\nNYTimes: World Scientists Look Elsewhere as U.S. Labs Stagger Under Trump Cuts\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/31/world/asia/us-science-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFor many of the others, the political turmoil in Washington has dried up job opportunities in what Professor Ladher [professor at the National Center for Biological Sciences in Bangalore] calls “the best research ecosystem in the world.” Some decided they would now rather take their skills elsewhere, including Austria, Japan and Australia, while others opted to stay in India.\n\n\nNYTimes: Denying Visas to Chinese Students Could Backfire on America\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/business/china-student-visas-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFor the millions of Chinese who have studied in the United States, myself [ Li Yuan] included, it is a sobering and disheartening development.

One might add Mary Ann Glendon, the Harvard law professor and former ambassador to the Vatican, who in July was named the head of President Trump’s Commission on Unalienable Rights.\n\n\nThe radicals, on the other hand, were those who believed that American liberalism had always been deeply hostile to the core values of Catholics.\n\n\nHarvard Law professor Adrian Vermeule accused Deneen of failing to grapple fully with the consequences of his own diagnosis. … What was needed was not the creation of new societies — which would survive only at the forbearance of the reigning powers — but a coup against the liberal “imperium” from within. … Rather than withdrawing from the power centers of liberal society, Vermeule recommends that administrators and other elites find a “strategic position” from which, as dissatisfaction with liberalism grows, they can turn that bureaucracy to “new ends.”\n\n(Deenan also raises the ire of David Brooks:)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/opinion/trump-vance-morality.html\n\nParks, libraries, museums: here’s why Trump is attacking America’s best-loved institutions | Margaret Sullivan | The Guardian\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/02/national-parks-libraries-museums-trump\n\nIt seems counterintuitive, but this is all a part of a broad plan that the great 20th-century political thinker Hannah Arendt would have understood all too well.\n\n\nTake away natural beauty, free access to books and support for the arts, and you end up with a less enlightened, more ignorant and less engaged public. That’s a public much more easily manipulated.\n\n\n“A people that can no longer believe in anything cannot make up its mind,” said Arendt, a student of authoritarianism, in 1973. Eventually, such a public “is deprived … of its ability to think and judge”, and with people like that, “you can then do what you please”.",

The laws mandate that students take civics courses focused on Western civilization and bar classes centered on race or gender from counting toward core requirements.\n\n\nState lawmakers have the authority to regulate curriculums and set requirements for graduation, but higher education experts say that until recently, they have let public colleges and universities lead the way. That began to change in 2020 after the first Trump administration issued an executive order to stamp out “divisive concepts” about race and gender in the federal government, according to the American Association of University Professors and American Federation of Teachers.\n\n\n“This is a new type of local intervention,” said Keith E. Whittington, founding chair of the Academic Committee of the Academic Freedom Alliance. “Some of the proposals are making more elaborate interventions about what the curriculum ought to look like and are also increasingly interested in the content.”\n\n\nHouse Democrats Air Grievances With McMahon\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/05/mcmahon-faces-angry-house-democrats\n\nThe Trump administration has recently criticized what it sees as a lack of viewpoint diversity at Harvard University and demanded that the institution hire more conservative professors if it would like to regain access to federal grant funding. At a Senate hearing Tuesday, McMahon said a federal law that prevents discrimination based on race and national origin gave the department the authority to make such demands.\n\n\nTakano [California Democrat] snapped back, saying, “I think it’s pretty clear you haven’t thought through this idea of viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\nNYTimes: A Professor Was Fired for Her Politics. Is That the Future of Academia?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/06/magazine/academic-freedom-politics.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut that night, reading Kanazi’s words while taking in the news, she felt a pitch of fury and despair at the rising number of dead in Gaza and her sense that too few Americans were similarly horrified. She believed in her right to state her beliefs and share those of others, like Kanazi, with whom she sympathized. Besides, the post would disappear from her Instagram stories by the following evening.\n\n\nTwo days later, on a Friday, Finkelstein got an email from Jennifer Storm, the director of equity and Title IX at Muhlenberg, asking her to come to a meeting the following Monday — with a lawyer if she wanted one.\n\n\nBut the meeting, which took place a week later on Zoom with Finkelstein’s lawyer present, was entirely about her repost. Finkelstein was told not to return to campus and locked out of her email. Her classes would be reassigned to an adjunct professor while the college hired an outside firm to investigate.\n\n\nThe investigation stretched over the spring semester. Then, in May, Finkelstein received a new letter from the college: She was being fired, with cause. This despite her having tenure, a historic form of academic job protection meant to insulate scholars from the steamrolling power of both politics and public opinion. Less noticed at the time, but arguably more prophetic, was how the mechanics of her firing trammeled yet another longtime standard in the academy, that of professors’ deciding among themselves when and if a colleague should be fired.",

Then He Got in Trouble.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/brown-university-newspaper-musk-doge.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThousands of administrative employees at Brown University woke up this spring to an email with pointed Elon Musk-like questions about their job responsibilities.\n\n\nPlease describe your role, it asked. What tasks have you performed in the past week? How would Brown students be affected if your job didn’t exist?\n\n\nThe March 18 email was from a sophomore, Alex Shieh, who explained that the responses would be included in a story for The Brown Spectator, a new, as yet unpublished conservative newspaper on campus.\n\n\nTwo days later, Brown notified Mr. Shieh that he was under investigation for possible violations of the university’s code of student conduct, including its prohibitions on invasion of privacy, misrepresentation and emotional or psychological harm.\n\n\nWith that, his case — and that of two Spectator students who were later placed under investigation — became the latest flashpoint in the free speech wars on American college campuses.\n\n\nBrown eventually cleared all three students of wrongdoing. But their case is yet another example of how universities continue to struggle with protecting the rights of students to express themselves on campus, after years of trying to adjudicate just when political expression tips into harassment.\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Attacks on Black History Betray America\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/opinion/black-history-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration’s framing of Black history as “D.E.I.” — and “D.E.I.” as harming white Americans — recasts its attack on Black history as protecting white Americans. As administering justice. Which is the justification of nearly every Klan and racist mob attack in history. The justification of the Atlanta attack in 1906.\n\n\nOpinion | Here are the people Trump is trying to delete\n\nhttps://wapo.st/3Hs6XZb\n(Sexism too)\n\nAbout 80 percent of the erased images contained one or more targeted keywords, such as gay, transgender, women, Hispanic and Black.\n\n\nEntire demographics are being scrubbed from records of both America’s past and present — including people of color, transgender people, women, immigrants and people with disabilities. They are now among America’s “missing persons.”\n\n\nPeople who aren’t White are an especially frequent target of government erasure.\n\n\nWomen (alongside racial minorities) have been disproportionately fired in purges of National Institutes of Health science review boards and senior military leadership positions. A landmark study on women’s health — the Women’s Health Initiative — was canceled entirely in April, though eventually restored after significant public outcry. The Labor Department likewise canceled grants for women’s apprenticeship programs last week.\n\n\nMore broadly, the terms “woman” and “women” have also appeared on banned-word lists for federal agency websites, grant applications and other external communications, including at the National Science Foundation and the Food and Drug Administration.",

Rubio did not clarify what fields could be considered critical, potentially setting the stage for a sweeping focus on areas where GOP lawmakers have raised concerns about sensitive national security research being shared with the Chinese government.\n\n\nAt a press conference yesterday, department spokesperson Tammy Bruce declined to “get into the details” of how the new visa scrutiny would be applied or what “critical fields” the department was referring to, because it “might give up our hand and make certain things less effective.”\n\n\n“‘Aggressively revoking’ visas based on political ideology is a gross violation of basic free expression principles that anchor the academy,” he [Jonathan Friedman, managing director of U.S. free expression at PEN America] wrote to Inside Higher Ed.\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/colleges-across-u-s-fear-chill-on-enrollments-of-foreign-students\n\nThe visa-interview suspension capped a week of bad news: The nominee to oversee the student-visa system vowed to end work authorization for recent international graduates, a move that could seriously dent the appeal of American colleges. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned foreign students who had not updated their employment records that they could face deportation. And the Trump administration took the unprecedented step of revoking Harvard University’s authority to enroll international students as part of an all-fronts showdown with one of the nation’s most prestigious institutions. Other colleges could be next, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in announcing the decision: “Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country.”\n\n\nTrump administration claims Chinese students ‘exploit’ U.S. universities\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/01/china-us-students-national-security-threat/\n\nWhat the New Travel Ban Means for Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-the-new-travel-ban-means-for-higher-ed\n\nAnd taken together, the two proclamations underscore the extent to which international students are simultaneously in the crosshairs of two of the most contentious and virulent issues of the Trump presidency, its opposition to immigration and its fight to force higher education to bend to government’s agenda.\n\n\nRestrictions on international students are a powerful lever to use against colleges, many of which have come to rely on the higher tuition paid by foreign students in a time of leaner budgets and domestic demographic declines. At the graduate level, visa holders are the backbone of American research and science.",

The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state on Wednesday over its policy of allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at public universities. Within hours, Texas sided with the Justice Department, and U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor granted a permanent injunction, quashing the policy.\n\n\nIn an interview before the permanent injunction, Ahilan Arulanantham, professor from practice at the UCLA School of Law and co-director of the law school’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said he didn’t believe a legal ruling in the Justice Department’s favor would necessarily affect other states, such as California, with similar laws. He said Texas used a residency criterion to decide eligibility for in-state tuition, an approach more vulnerable to legal challenges than some of the criteria other states use.\n\n\nBut even if other states go unscathed, losing in-state tuition benefits is “extraordinarily significant” for the “massive” undocumented population in Texas, he said.",

And that’s not the only shake-up happening at the NSF, which Congress created in 1950 to “promote the progress of science; advance the national health, prosperity and welfare; and secure the national defense.” The Trump administration has also laid off staff and proposed slashing the agency’s budget.\n\n\nAdditionally, NSF announced new priorities that include not funding projects aimed at recruiting more Americans from underrepresented backgrounds to the STEM workforce—a key focus for the agency historically.\n\n\nThe Trump administration says all these changes are part of its plan to reform the NSF, correct an alleged “scientific slowdown,” build a “a robust domestic STEM workforce” and “rapidly accelerate its investment in critical and advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology.” The NSF sends billions to colleges and universities to support STEM education and nonmedical scientific research.\n\n\nNYTimes: White House Unveils New Details of Stark Budget Cuts\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/us/politics/white-house-budget-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe White House budget is not a matter of law. Ultimately, it is up to Congress to determine the budget, and in recent years it has routinely discarded many of the president’s proposals. Lawmakers are only starting to embark on the annual process, with government funding set to expire at the end of September.\n\n\nTargeting the Education Department, the president again put forward a roughly $12 billion cut, seeking to eliminate dozens of programs while unveiling new changes to Pell grants, which help low-income students pay for college.\n\n\nThe maximum award would be capped at $5,710 for the 2026-7 award year, a decrease of more than $1,600.\n\n\nMr. Trump and his budget director, Russell T. Vought, “are clearly hiding their policy goals, because they would hurt the middle class, the working class and the vulnerable,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, who leads her party on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\n\nNew Details of Trump’s Budget Cuts Alarm Researchers\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/03/new-details-trumps-budget-cuts-alarm-researchers\n\nTrump Wants Grant Makers to Become Political Appointees\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/05/trump-policy-moves-make-grant-makers-political\n\nOfficials say the policy, which would make it easier to fire thousands of government employees, is designed to increase accountability. But experts say it would increase corruption and threaten the nation’s health and economy.\n\n\nIn April, the Office of Personnel Management posted to the Federal Register a proposed rule “to increase career employee accountability” by allowing agencies to quickly remove from critical positions employees “who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.” That could include any employee with “substantive participation and discretionary authority in agency grantmaking,” such as those involved in drafting funding opportunity announcements, evaluating grant applications and recommending or selecting grant recipients.\n\n\n\n\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION FY 2026 Budget Request to Congress\n\nhttps://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/00-NSF-FY26-CJ-Entire-Rollup.pdf\n\n(NSF PROGRAMS TO BROADEN PARTICIPATION (BP)) Total, Broadening Participation Programs FY24 appropriated: $1,613.85M FY26 (Request) $171.31M\n\n(That’s 10.6 percent of the good old days.

The startling accusations show how the Trump administration is wielding power in pursuit of its political agenda.\n\n\nIn a series of letters that have not been previously reported, the government also disclosed that it had a “cooperating witness” inside the student-run journal. That witness now works in the White House under Stephen Miller, the architect of the administration’s domestic policy agenda, Trump officials confirmed.\n\n\nBut the aggressive language in the letters from the Justice Department’s two top civil rights lawyers appeared to have overstated the allegations in pursuit of an additional way to punish Harvard.

She said the government looked forward to being “fully informed of actions taken to ensure Columbia’s compliance with accreditation standards, including compliance with federal civil rights laws.”\n\n\nPresident Trump has described the accreditation process as his “secret weapon” to force ideological changes at universities. But the Trump administration does not have direct control over which universities are accredited. Instead, those decisions are made by nongovernmental organizations certified by the government, in a complex process meant to insulate universities from political interference.\n\n\nNo, Trump Is Not Pulling Columbia’s Accreditation. Here’s What You Need to Know.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/no-trump-is-not-pulling-columbias-accreditation-heres-what-you-need-to-know\n\nIn terms of individual colleges, the federal government has no direct authority to interpret an accreditor’s standards, said John R. Przypyszny, a lawyer who specializes in accreditation. So Trump alone can’t revoke Columbia’s accreditation, which would cut off access to federal financial aid.\n\n\nThe Education Department’s letter, sent Wednesday, argued that Columbia has violated the standards of the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.\n\n\nBecause Columbia failed to adequately respond to antisemitic behavior during protests against the war in Gaza, the department’s Office for Civil Rights concluded last month, the institution has violated Title VI, which bars discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, including shared Jewish ancestry. Therefore, the letter continues, Columbia “fails to meet the standards for accreditation,” the department said in a news release. In light of that, the department said, the Middle States Commission must require the university to “establish a plan to come into compliance.”\n\n\nNYTimes: To Bolster Columbia Inquiry, Prosecutor Likened Hamas Graffiti to Cross Burning\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/04/us/politics/columbia-protester-hamas-cross.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Justice Department, intent on pursuing a criminal case against student protesters at Columbia University, argued that graffiti with a Hamas symbol outside the home of the school’s interim president threatened her life and was comparable to a racist cross burning, newly unsealed court documents show.\n\n\nThe photo showed graffiti in bright red paint on the building where the university president lived, with the words “free them all” and an inverted triangle.\n\n(How freeing protestors becomes pro-Hamas, I’ll leave for others, but the article mentions an accompanying instagram post.)\n\nThe records also underscore how determined the Trump administration was to press forward with a case judges viewed as weak. Justice Department leaders pushed for an investigation of a student group, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, but federal judges in New York rejected the administration’s efforts to get a search warrant four times, in what some veteran lawyers described as an unusually prolonged disagreement between federal prosecutors and the courts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is saw on bluesky this week\n\n\nIndiana’s governor fired all the elected members of Indiana University’s Board of Trustees.

Faculty were downgraded to “advisory only” roles in university decision-making. Degree programs that graduated too few students would be closed.\n\n\nAnd at Indiana University, whose flagship campus in Bloomington is ranked among the nation’s top 100 schools, the state’s governor was given new power over the school’s governing board.\n\n\nThe moves align with a conservative playbook to reduce faculty power on campuses perceived by many on the right as bastions of liberal thought. This year, several other Republican-led states passed laws requiring reviews for tenured faculty and the reorganization of programs at public institutions that have low enrollment.\n\n\nMany faculty members see the Indiana bill as an attack on their university’s independence and part of an effort to restrict their own freedom to teach and speak. They read Dr. Whitten’s [President of Indiana University] silence as support for the changes.\n\n\nIndiana’s experience has been emblematic of the pressures facing public universities. But several factors — an active protest movement on campus, a state with strong conservative leanings and Dr. Whitten herself, a leader at odds with many on her campus — have created especially tense conditions.\n\n\nDr. Whitten’s administration acted almost immediately. The university called in the Indiana State Police, which stationed snipers on rooftops and arrested 57 people, including a handful of faculty members.\n\n(Snipers!!!)\n\nDr. Whitten and the faculty have long had a frosty relationship. Earlier that spring, more than 800 faculty member approved a vote of no confidence in Dr. Whitten.

It is well worth getting past the paywall to read/)\n\nThe warlords who sacked Rome did not intend to doom Western Europe to centuries of ignorance. It was not a foreseeable consequence of their actions. The same cannot be said of the sweeping attack on human knowledge and progress that the Trump administration is now undertaking—a deliberate destruction of education, science, and history, conducted with a fanaticism that recalls the Dark Ages that followed Rome’s fall.\n\n\nEvery week brings fresh examples. The administration is threatening colleges and universities with the loss of federal funding if they do not submit to its demands, or even if they do. The engines of American scientific inquiry and ingenuity, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, are under sustained attack. Historical institutions such as the Smithsonian and artistic ones like the Kennedy Center are being converted into homes for MAGA ideology rather than historical fact and free expression. Libraries are losing funding, government-employed scientists are being dismissed from their jobs, educators are being cowed into silence, and researchers are being warned not to broach forbidden subjects. Entire databases of public-health information collected over decades are at risk of vanishing. Any facts that contradict the gospel of Trumpism are treated as heretical.\n\n\nLike the inquisitors of old, who persecuted Galileo for daring to notice that the sun did not, in fact, revolve around the Earth, they believe that truth-seeking imperils their hold on power.\n\n\nBut a massive technological stall is only the most apparent aspect of the coming damage. The attack on knowledge also threatens the country’s ability to address subtler social problems, such as racial and economic inequalities in health, opportunity, and civil rights. Research into these disparities is being cut across government and civil society in the name of defeating so-called wokeness. Invoked as a general criticism of left-wing excess, the fight against “wokeness” is destroying huge swaths of scholarship and research, for fear the results might make the case for racial or gender equality, the redistribution of wealth, or the regulation of industry.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s Politics of Plunder\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/donald-trumps-politics-of-plunder\n\nHistorically, ruling billionaires have tried to avoid such portraits. (A publicist for J. P. Morgan used to say that he was “paid to keep the bank out of the press.”) But the Trump Presidency has embraced an unusually open marriage of politics and profit. Official filings revealed that his Inauguration fund set a new record by collecting some two hundred and fifty million dollars from corporations, C.E.O.s, and other large donors. The biggest donation, five million dollars, came from a major poultry producer called Pilgrim’s Pride. A few months later, Trump’s Agriculture Secretary delighted the industry by agreeing not to increase salmonella testing and promising to cut “unnecessary bureaucracy.” By then, Trump had already fired the director of the Office of Government Ethics and the head of the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates whistle-blower complaints.\n\n\non-one conversations with the President have become available for five million. The return on investment is uncertain, a government-affairs executive told me: “What if he’s in a bad mood? You have no clue where the money is eventually going.” Another lobbying veteran described the frank exchange as “outer-borough Mafia shit.”\n\n\nThe ultra-rich have captured more of America’s wealth than even the nineteenth-century tycoons of the Gilded Age. Scholars who study inequality as far back as the Neolithic period struggle to find precedents. Tim Kerig, an archeologist who directs the Museum Alzey, in Germany, told me, “The people who built the Egyptian pyramids were probably in a less unequal society.” He suggested that today’s richest people are simply accumulating too much wealth for the system to contain. “The economic and technical evolution is much faster than the social, mental, and ideological evolution,” he said. “We had no time to adapt to all those billionaires.”\n\n\nFor fifteen years, the Patriotic Millionaires have waged an earnest battle to persuade wealthy people to lobby for higher taxes on themselves. This has often been a lonesome endeavor, but Trump’s assault on democracy, financed by some of America’s richest people, has fortified the group’s arguments. Scott Ellis, a member who used to run a consulting group at Hewlett-Packard, told me that even skeptical peers in Silicon Valley had become increasingly receptive. “Some friends used to humor me, but they’re listening more,” he said.\n\n\nIn the 2004 election, according to Americans for Tax Fairness, billionaires gave thirteen million dollars in political contributions; twenty years later, the country’s richest families spent more than two hundred times that much. Payne told the crowd, “There’s a point where money is no longer money. It is power—and they’re using that power to screw life up for everybody else.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas House OKs more state oversight of public universities | The Texas Tribune\n\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/24/texas-governing-boards-regents-senate-bill-37/\n\nSenate Bill 37 passed in an 83-53 vote Saturday. It would create a state-level committee that would recommend courses that should be required for graduation and how to condense the number of those courses. Meanwhile, each public university system’s board of regents, who oversee the school’s operations and are appointed by the governor, would be charged with creating a committee to review curricula and reject any course deemed ideologically charged or that doesn’t align with the workforce demands. Specifically, the committees would ensure curricula do not “advocate or promote that any race, sex, ethnicity or religious belief is inherently superior to any other.”\n\n(This bill if passed is much more than a glancing blow to higher education’s principles.)\n\nIn Defense of Academic Freedom - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/05/in-defense-of-academic-freedom/682914/\n\nWhy defend academic freedom even when the ideas in question are wrongheaded or harmful? “It is precisely because any kind of purge opens the gate to all kinds of purge, that freedom of thought necessarily means the freedom to think bad thoughts as well as good.”\n\n\nThose words, written in 1953 by Joseph Alsop, an alumnus of Harvard who later served on its Board of Overseers, are relevant today, as the Trump administration cancels the visas of foreign students for viewpoints that it deems “bad.” And they were relevant in recent years as institutions of higher education investigated and disciplined members of their communities for expressing views that ran afoul of various progressive social-justice orthodoxies. But Alsop wrote them in response to the McCarthy era’s efforts to identify and punish Communists who were working in academia.\n\n\nA Tumultuous Spring Semester Finally Comes to a Close | The New Yorker\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/a-tumultuous-spring-semester-finally-comes-to-a-close\n\nThe biggest mistake that some universities have made is to presume that the White House is operating in good faith. It is not.\n\n\nAcademic freedom in the United States has found itself periodically under siege. In March, Ellen Schrecker, a historian and the author of “No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities,” spoke via Zoom to deans at Columbia (including myself) about government repression on college campuses in the nineteen-fifties. Schrecker, who has taught at both Columbia and Harvard and retired as a professor at Yeshiva University, emphasized the severity of the current climate. “I’ve studied McCarthyism’s impact on higher education for fifty years,” she said. “What’s happening now is worse.” This is in part because universities today are far more beholden to the federal government. The explosive expansion of higher education that began after the Second World War was underwritten by federal dollars. So members of Congress, and President Trump, too, have leverage that demagogues who preceded them could only dream of.\n\n\nMordecai Johnson was a Black man leading an academic institution during Jim Crow when representatives from an almost entirely white Congress asked him whether professors with radical sympathies should be allowed to teach at Howard. Yet he firmly said that he would sooner shut down his university than allow anyone to dictate what its students could or could not learn. The principle at play—that without free inquiry there is no basis for a university to exist—still applies.\n\n\nUtah Lawmakers Flex Their Power Over Public Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/05/28/new-utah-law-prompts-program-cuts-strategic\n(Thanks SC for sharing and caring)\n\nPublic colleges and universities in Utah are set to lose roughly $60 million in July—or 10 percent of their state-funded instructional budgets—but they can earn back that money by cutting programs and positions and investing in other areas considered worthy by state lawmakers, under a law passed this spring.\n\n\nHB 265 is just one example of how Republicans in Utah’s State House are trying to exert more control over public higher education and shape colleges’ academic programs and services. The changes have raised concerns among faculty, who see their traditional academic freedom and shared governance roles in setting curricula and other areas being usurped.\n\n\nSince 2024, lawmakers have mandated post-tenure review; banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and offices; and banned pride flags, Juneteenth flags and others from “prominent” campus locations. They’ve also created a Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that faculty appointed to that center teach all the university’s general education courses while serving on short-term, at-will contracts.\n\n\nAs for university administrators, Gerdes [president of the University of Utah’s AAUP chapter] said, “Our administration wants to have a healthy working relationship with the State Legislature. I think that they are less concerned about having a healthy relationship with their own faculty.”\n\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune reported that university president Taylor R. Randall cited a 2024 law, Senate Bill 192, on the limits of faculty governance to silence an Academic Senate discussion in February that was critical of his provost.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nRFK Jr. says he may bar scientists from publishing in top medical journals\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/rfk-jr-ban-journals-lancet-jama/\n\n“We’re probably going to stop publishing in the Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA and those other journals because they’re all corrupt,” Kennedy said during an appearance on the “Ultimate Human” podcast. He also described the journals as being under the control of pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\nOn his plans for the department to create its own journals, Kennedy said they would “become the preeminent journals, because if you get [NIH] funding, it is anointing you as a good, legitimate scientist.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump addresses a West Point upended by his changes\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/24/trump-west-point-graduation-dei-military/\n\nHe said that as president, he had rebuilt the military “better than ever before” and rid it of “social experiments” like the teaching of critical race theory and efforts to support transgender soldiers. And he took credit for a rise in military recruitment.\n\n\n“It’s a feeling of real whiplash,” said Graham Parsons, a former West Point professor who resigned from America’s oldest service academy after publicly criticizing the impact of Trump’s policies. “We used to raise the possibility that in the military and beyond, there are still real structural problems with racism and sexism. That would not fly now.”\n\n\nNYTimes: For Trump, Civil Rights Protections Should Help White Men\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/us/politics/trump-race-civil-right-white-men.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAnd last month, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission launched an investigation at Harvard University, alleging that the school had engaged in discriminatory hiring because it showed a significant increase in the percentage of minority, female and nonbinary faculty earning tenure over the past decade while the rates for white men declined.\n\n\nConservatives have denounced disparate impact because it relies on outcome data to allege and prove discrimination — the basis on which Ms. Lucas lodged her charge against Harvard.\n\n\nHow Harmeet Dhillon is engineering a U-turn in the Justice Department’s civil-rights division\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/harmeet-dhillons-civil-rights-revolution-comes-with-tea-and-roses-ff9b1874?st=s7pVVz&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(An attempt at a flattering profile, but don’t be put led astray)\n\n“What we’re seeing now is a complete gutting of all the traditional work of the civil-rights division and then a rump of the civil-rights division being used almost exclusively to pursue right-wing Trumpist agenda items,” said Samuel Bagenstos, a former senior civil-rights official in the Obama Justice Department.\n\n\nUncle Sam’s new message to young Black Americans: I don’t want you\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/27/trump-military-hostile-black-americans/\n\nTrump and his allies have pushed aggressively to defund or eliminate DEI programs across the military. One of Trump’s first actions was to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., only the second African American ever to hold that position.

What Are the Consequences?\n\nhttps://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/trump-cancels-federal-research-grants-what-are-consequences\n\nLast August, Jaafar [professor in the math, engineering and computer science department at LaGuardia Community College] realized a long-held dream of hers to win a NSF grant: $530,002 aimed at boosting students’ success in STEM degrees (and consequently their success in New York City’s workplaces). This grant-funded work would have involved about 40 faculty members directly, plus many more through a robust diffusion model, says Jaafar, providing the kind of professional development that leads to “long-term behavioral change, so that faculty become change agents,” she said. “You go through this transformation and then you’re able to transform others.”\n\n\nOver the three years, Jaafar estimates that trained faculty would have influenced about 5,000 students at LaGuardia, a formally designated Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). “Without making these investments, we’re going to enforce the longstanding barriers to access—and we’ll actually be falling short in workforce needs,” she says.\n\n\nThese aren’t the only NSF grants to CUNY institutions that have been terminated. Indeed, about $17 million in grants have been targeted, including the following:\n\n\nA $1 million grant to Queensborough Community College, Queens College and LaGuardia to develop a program that trains students in the emerging field of wastewater-based epidemiology. The goal was to train about 200 students for public-service jobs.\n\n\nA $1 million grant to LaGuardia, City Tech, which is a 4-year college, and the biotechnology company Schrödinger to create a program that provides hands-on, experiential learning and paid internships.\n\n\nA $700,000 grant to the College of Staten Island to increase students’ sense of belonging and retention through peer-led team learning. Already, this project was achieving dramatic increases in passing rates, but because of the grant’s termination its paid peer leaders have been dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Fulbright Applicants, a DEI Disqualifier\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/us-colleges-world/2025/05/29/fulbright-applicants-rejected-over-dei-research-proposals\n\nInside Higher Ed obtained a copy of Rubio’s cable, which says that this year State Department officials would give the final sign-off; they have been tasked with rooting out any projects that could violate President Trump’s executive orders banning diversity, equity and inclusion. All candidates, whether they’d been approved by FFSB [Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board] already or not, would have to pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Seeks Extensive Student Data in Pressure Campaign to Control Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/trump-harvard-international-student-records.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nKristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, sent a letter to Harvard requesting, among other things, coursework for every international student and information on any student visa holder involved in misconduct or illegal activity.\n\n\nMs. Noem also expanded her request for records to include any videos of international students, on campus or off, involved in protests or illegal or dangerous activity.\n\n(This is of note given CUNY’s recent decision to adopt body worn cameras for its public safety officers.)\n\nNYTimes: Why Harvard Has No Way Out\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nHarvard has won praise for fighting back, and many legal experts believe the law is squarely on its side. But the administration holds the levers of power, and is methodically and creatively using them in a take-no-prisoners assault on the school.\n\n\n“I was dumbfounded,” Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, told me. “What’s becoming increasingly clear is that this administration will use any tool that it can.”\n\n\nMS [Michael Schmidt]: There’s been an audacity and creativity to the way that Trump has tried to use his power in the second term, and this is the latest example. Coming into this, we concentrated on his threats to lock up his enemies, like Liz Cheney or James Comey. The use of the government’s power for purely political ends has manifested itself in ways that I think go beyond what we had imagined, and even beyond what Project 2025 contemplated.\n\n\nHarvard officials have privately determined they are in a major, major, major crisis with very few, if any, good off ramps.\n\n(I hope we recognize that Harvard’s battle is the ultimate fight for academic freedom and the independence of higher education – the assault has no rational explanation; its destructiveness can’t be rationalized.)\n\nHarvard Digs In for Battle, but Trump’s Blows Are Landing\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/harvard-trump-lawsuits-fight-d5f8ec8a?st=27ignH&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nEven as Harvard looks to the courts for relief, faculty and administrators are making contingency plans and preparing for a drawn-out war with the Trump administration\n\n\nHarvard’s conundrum is that it cannot trust the Trump administration to negotiate in good faith nor can it count on winning an extended battle with the federal government, says Aziz Z. Huq, a law professor at the University of Chicago.\n\n\nThe result, Huq suggests, will be a reset not only for Harvard but across higher education. The current model for research universities was created during World War II, when the military outsourced its research and development to schools. That model served the nation well for decades but is increasingly under attack from MAGA conservatives who believe that higher education has become a hotbed of liberal ideology that needs to be torn down and rebuilt.\n\n(I’d rephrase that last part, but will amplify “That model served the nation well for decades” until the mis-informed got mid-informed.)\n\nThe government seems bent on destroying Harvard for the offense of fighting back.

Noem’s letter to Harvard makes clear that Trump and his sycophants will weaponize the state against anyone who incurs their displeasure. Courts may prevent the worst, but the whole pattern has to end if we want to have any hope of living in a country free of fear and featuring at least minimum respect for the rule of law.\n\n\nAs Harvard’s lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security rightly pointed out, Noem’s revocation fits into the Trump administration’s orgy of vengeance prompted by Harvard’s refusal to comply with evidently illegal demands issued in mid-April.\n\n\nWe can draw larger lessons from this – so far – failed attack (eight investigations, involving six different agencies, are still ongoing). One has to be ready – Harvard’s lawyers clearly were. Universities have to stand with each other; Noem warned all of them that they have to “get their act together” or else. Not least, university leaders have to explain to a larger public how Trumpists, in an unprecedented spree of national self-destruction, are busy preventing cancer cures, damaging American soft power, and killing one of the country’s major exports, namely higher education.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Attacks Have Helped Heal a Deeply Divided Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/us/trump-attacks-unify-divided-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDoes the President Want to Fix Harvard or Destroy It? by @jasonrileywsj\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/opinion/does-the-president-want-to-fix-harvard-or-destroy-it-0bf083d1?st=Ya1Vwx&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(destroy… even the WSJ recognizes this…)\n\nNYTimes: Harvard and Trump Lawyers to Face Off in Court in Foreign Student Case\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/us/harvard-trump-lawyers-hearing-foreign-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIn the courtroom, Harvard’s strategy will use the president’s statements as evidence that the government is on a political crusade against the school.

The Trump administration is all in; is higher ed?)\n\nWhile international students make up slightly more than 5 percent of university students nationwide, some of the nation’s most selective schools rely far more heavily on them. At New York University, home to nearly 60,000 students, one-third of them are international. At Columbia, about two in five students come from abroad. And at Harvard, more than a quarter of students come from across the globe.\n\n\n“This sends a signal to the rest of the world that not only is Harvard closed to the international best and brightest, but that the U.S. is not a welcome place for international students,” Mr. Lakhani said [admissions counselor in New York].\n\n\nTrump’s war on America’s Ivy League universities didn’t start with the 2023 anti-Israel protests.

It is well worth getting past the paywall to read/)\n\nThe warlords who sacked Rome did not intend to doom Western Europe to centuries of ignorance. It was not a foreseeable consequence of their actions. The same cannot be said of the sweeping attack on human knowledge and progress that the Trump administration is now undertaking—a deliberate destruction of education, science, and history, conducted with a fanaticism that recalls the Dark Ages that followed Rome’s fall.\n\n\nEvery week brings fresh examples. The administration is threatening colleges and universities with the loss of federal funding if they do not submit to its demands, or even if they do. The engines of American scientific inquiry and ingenuity, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, are under sustained attack. Historical institutions such as the Smithsonian and artistic ones like the Kennedy Center are being converted into homes for MAGA ideology rather than historical fact and free expression. Libraries are losing funding, government-employed scientists are being dismissed from their jobs, educators are being cowed into silence, and researchers are being warned not to broach forbidden subjects. Entire databases of public-health information collected over decades are at risk of vanishing. Any facts that contradict the gospel of Trumpism are treated as heretical.\n\n\nLike the inquisitors of old, who persecuted Galileo for daring to notice that the sun did not, in fact, revolve around the Earth, they believe that truth-seeking imperils their hold on power.\n\n\nBut a massive technological stall is only the most apparent aspect of the coming damage. The attack on knowledge also threatens the country’s ability to address subtler social problems, such as racial and economic inequalities in health, opportunity, and civil rights. Research into these disparities is being cut across government and civil society in the name of defeating so-called wokeness. Invoked as a general criticism of left-wing excess, the fight against “wokeness” is destroying huge swaths of scholarship and research, for fear the results might make the case for racial or gender equality, the redistribution of wealth, or the regulation of industry.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s Politics of Plunder\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/donald-trumps-politics-of-plunder\n\nHistorically, ruling billionaires have tried to avoid such portraits. (A publicist for J. P. Morgan used to say that he was “paid to keep the bank out of the press.”) But the Trump Presidency has embraced an unusually open marriage of politics and profit. Official filings revealed that his Inauguration fund set a new record by collecting some two hundred and fifty million dollars from corporations, C.E.O.s, and other large donors. The biggest donation, five million dollars, came from a major poultry producer called Pilgrim’s Pride. A few months later, Trump’s Agriculture Secretary delighted the industry by agreeing not to increase salmonella testing and promising to cut “unnecessary bureaucracy.” By then, Trump had already fired the director of the Office of Government Ethics and the head of the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates whistle-blower complaints.\n\n\non-one conversations with the President have become available for five million. The return on investment is uncertain, a government-affairs executive told me: “What if he’s in a bad mood? You have no clue where the money is eventually going.” Another lobbying veteran described the frank exchange as “outer-borough Mafia shit.”\n\n\nThe ultra-rich have captured more of America’s wealth than even the nineteenth-century tycoons of the Gilded Age. Scholars who study inequality as far back as the Neolithic period struggle to find precedents. Tim Kerig, an archeologist who directs the Museum Alzey, in Germany, told me, “The people who built the Egyptian pyramids were probably in a less unequal society.” He suggested that today’s richest people are simply accumulating too much wealth for the system to contain. “The economic and technical evolution is much faster than the social, mental, and ideological evolution,” he said. “We had no time to adapt to all those billionaires.”\n\n\nFor fifteen years, the Patriotic Millionaires have waged an earnest battle to persuade wealthy people to lobby for higher taxes on themselves. This has often been a lonesome endeavor, but Trump’s assault on democracy, financed by some of America’s richest people, has fortified the group’s arguments. Scott Ellis, a member who used to run a consulting group at Hewlett-Packard, told me that even skeptical peers in Silicon Valley had become increasingly receptive. “Some friends used to humor me, but they’re listening more,” he said.\n\n\nIn the 2004 election, according to Americans for Tax Fairness, billionaires gave thirteen million dollars in political contributions; twenty years later, the country’s richest families spent more than two hundred times that much. Payne told the crowd, “There’s a point where money is no longer money. It is power—and they’re using that power to screw life up for everybody else.”",

    "text": "Texas House OKs more state oversight of public universities | The Texas Tribune\n\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/24/texas-governing-boards-regents-senate-bill-37/\n\nSenate Bill 37 passed in an 83-53 vote Saturday. It would create a state-level committee that would recommend courses that should be required for graduation and how to condense the number of those courses. Meanwhile, each public university system’s board of regents, who oversee the school’s operations and are appointed by the governor, would be charged with creating a committee to review curricula and reject any course deemed ideologically charged or that doesn’t align with the workforce demands. Specifically, the committees would ensure curricula do not “advocate or promote that any race, sex, ethnicity or religious belief is inherently superior to any other.”\n\n(This bill if passed is much more than a glancing blow to higher education’s principles.)\n\nIn Defense of Academic Freedom - The Atlantic\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/05/in-defense-of-academic-freedom/682914/\n\nWhy defend academic freedom even when the ideas in question are wrongheaded or harmful? “It is precisely because any kind of purge opens the gate to all kinds of purge, that freedom of thought necessarily means the freedom to think bad thoughts as well as good.”\n\n\nThose words, written in 1953 by Joseph Alsop, an alumnus of Harvard who later served on its Board of Overseers, are relevant today, as the Trump administration cancels the visas of foreign students for viewpoints that it deems “bad.” And they were relevant in recent years as institutions of higher education investigated and disciplined members of their communities for expressing views that ran afoul of various progressive social-justice orthodoxies. But Alsop wrote them in response to the McCarthy era’s efforts to identify and punish Communists who were working in academia.\n\n\nA Tumultuous Spring Semester Finally Comes to a Close | The New Yorker\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/06/02/a-tumultuous-spring-semester-finally-comes-to-a-close\n\nThe biggest mistake that some universities have made is to presume that the White House is operating in good faith. It is not.\n\n\nAcademic freedom in the United States has found itself periodically under siege. In March, Ellen Schrecker, a historian and the author of “No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities,” spoke via Zoom to deans at Columbia (including myself) about government repression on college campuses in the nineteen-fifties. Schrecker, who has taught at both Columbia and Harvard and retired as a professor at Yeshiva University, emphasized the severity of the current climate. “I’ve studied McCarthyism’s impact on higher education for fifty years,” she said. “What’s happening now is worse.” This is in part because universities today are far more beholden to the federal government. The explosive expansion of higher education that began after the Second World War was underwritten by federal dollars. So members of Congress, and President Trump, too, have leverage that demagogues who preceded them could only dream of.\n\n\nMordecai Johnson was a Black man leading an academic institution during Jim Crow when representatives from an almost entirely white Congress asked him whether professors with radical sympathies should be allowed to teach at Howard. Yet he firmly said that he would sooner shut down his university than allow anyone to dictate what its students could or could not learn. The principle at play—that without free inquiry there is no basis for a university to exist—still applies.\n\n\nUtah Lawmakers Flex Their Power Over Public Universities\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/05/28/new-utah-law-prompts-program-cuts-strategic\n(Thanks SC for sharing and caring)\n\nPublic colleges and universities in Utah are set to lose roughly $60 million in July—or 10 percent of their state-funded instructional budgets—but they can earn back that money by cutting programs and positions and investing in other areas considered worthy by state lawmakers, under a law passed this spring.\n\n\nHB 265 is just one example of how Republicans in Utah’s State House are trying to exert more control over public higher education and shape colleges’ academic programs and services. The changes have raised concerns among faculty, who see their traditional academic freedom and shared governance roles in setting curricula and other areas being usurped.\n\n\nSince 2024, lawmakers have mandated post-tenure review; banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and offices; and banned pride flags, Juneteenth flags and others from “prominent” campus locations. They’ve also created a Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that faculty appointed to that center teach all the university’s general education courses while serving on short-term, at-will contracts.\n\n\nAs for university administrators, Gerdes [president of the University of Utah’s AAUP chapter] said, “Our administration wants to have a healthy working relationship with the State Legislature. I think that they are less concerned about having a healthy relationship with their own faculty.”\n\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune reported that university president Taylor R. Randall cited a 2024 law, Senate Bill 192, on the limits of faculty governance to silence an Academic Senate discussion in February that was critical of his provost.\n\n\nWe Don’t Need More Administrators Inspecting Our Ideas\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/we-dont-need-more-administrators-inspecting-our-ideas\n\nRFK Jr. says he may bar scientists from publishing in top medical journals\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/rfk-jr-ban-journals-lancet-jama/\n\n“We’re probably going to stop publishing in the Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA and those other journals because they’re all corrupt,” Kennedy said during an appearance on the “Ultimate Human” podcast. He also described the journals as being under the control of pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\nOn his plans for the department to create its own journals, Kennedy said they would “become the preeminent journals, because if you get [NIH] funding, it is anointing you as a good, legitimate scientist.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump addresses a West Point upended by his changes\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/24/trump-west-point-graduation-dei-military/\n\nHe said that as president, he had rebuilt the military “better than ever before” and rid it of “social experiments” like the teaching of critical race theory and efforts to support transgender soldiers. And he took credit for a rise in military recruitment.\n\n\n“It’s a feeling of real whiplash,” said Graham Parsons, a former West Point professor who resigned from America’s oldest service academy after publicly criticizing the impact of Trump’s policies. “We used to raise the possibility that in the military and beyond, there are still real structural problems with racism and sexism. That would not fly now.”\n\n\nNYTimes: For Trump, Civil Rights Protections Should Help White Men\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/us/politics/trump-race-civil-right-white-men.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAnd last month, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission launched an investigation at Harvard University, alleging that the school had engaged in discriminatory hiring because it showed a significant increase in the percentage of minority, female and nonbinary faculty earning tenure over the past decade while the rates for white men declined.\n\n\nConservatives have denounced disparate impact because it relies on outcome data to allege and prove discrimination — the basis on which Ms. Lucas lodged her charge against Harvard.\n\n\nHow Harmeet Dhillon is engineering a U-turn in the Justice Department’s civil-rights division\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/harmeet-dhillons-civil-rights-revolution-comes-with-tea-and-roses-ff9b1874?st=s7pVVz&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(An attempt at a flattering profile, but don’t be put led astray)\n\n“What we’re seeing now is a complete gutting of all the traditional work of the civil-rights division and then a rump of the civil-rights division being used almost exclusively to pursue right-wing Trumpist agenda items,” said Samuel Bagenstos, a former senior civil-rights official in the Obama Justice Department.\n\n\nUncle Sam’s new message to young Black Americans: I don’t want you\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/27/trump-military-hostile-black-americans/\n\nTrump and his allies have pushed aggressively to defund or eliminate DEI programs across the military. One of Trump’s first actions was to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., only the second African American ever to hold that position. Training on racial bias, cultural competency and inclusive leadership has been gutted and labeled “radical.” Officers who speak up about race or systemic injustice are accused of pushing “politics,” while those promoting exclusionary rhetoric are celebrated as patriots.\n\n\nThe message is clear: If you’re Black, Brown or anything other than the old guard — a White male — your presence in the military is conditional and increasingly unwelcome.\n\n\nThe Era of DEI for Conservatives Has Begun\n\n(Thanks BE)\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/conservative-professors-dei-initiatives/682944/?gift=yCYg0MdUGpnvquf3En3lpjtTtgMgla5OiobYjP9Hxt4&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share\n\nLegislatures in red and purple states across the country have shoveled money into universities to establish schools of civic thought, which are marketed as the conservative answer to academia’s leftward drift and the rise of identity-oriented disciplines.\n\n\nRepublicans have unfairly smeared affirmative action as a way to hire people “based on their race and not on their qualifications.” Now they’re the ones who want to hire professors based on their politics, not their fitness for the role.",

This grant-funded work would have involved about 40 faculty members directly, plus many more through a robust diffusion model, says Jaafar, providing the kind of professional development that leads to “long-term behavioral change, so that faculty become change agents,” she said. “You go through this transformation and then you’re able to transform others.”\n\n\nOver the three years, Jaafar estimates that trained faculty would have influenced about 5,000 students at LaGuardia, a formally designated Hispanic-serving institution (HSI). “Without making these investments, we’re going to enforce the longstanding barriers to access—and we’ll actually be falling short in workforce needs,” she says.\n\n\nThese aren’t the only NSF grants to CUNY institutions that have been terminated. Indeed, about $17 million in grants have been targeted, including the following:\n\n\nA $1 million grant to Queensborough Community College, Queens College and LaGuardia to develop a program that trains students in the emerging field of wastewater-based epidemiology. The goal was to train about 200 students for public-service jobs.\n\n\nA $1 million grant to LaGuardia, City Tech, which is a 4-year college, and the biotechnology company Schrödinger to create a program that provides hands-on, experiential learning and paid internships.\n\n\nA $700,000 grant to the College of Staten Island to increase students’ sense of belonging and retention through peer-led team learning.

The current model for research universities was created during World War II, when the military outsourced its research and development to schools. That model served the nation well for decades but is increasingly under attack from MAGA conservatives who believe that higher education has become a hotbed of liberal ideology that needs to be torn down and rebuilt.\n\n(I’d rephrase that last part, but will amplify “That model served the nation well for decades” until the mis-informed got mid-informed.)\n\nThe government seems bent on destroying Harvard for the offense of fighting back.

One has to be ready – Harvard’s lawyers clearly were. Universities have to stand with each other; Noem warned all of them that they have to “get their act together” or else.

Not him.\n\n\nA federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration’s efforts to deport Columbia University demonstrator Mahmoud Khalil were likely unconstitutional\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/mahmoud-khalil-deportation-unconstitutional-judge-194a0d4a?st=2MPd18&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Universities See Trump’s Harvard Move as a Threat to Them, Too\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/24/us/harvard-trump-international-students-impact.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMore than 5,000 miles away, Wendy Hensel, the president of the University of Hawaii, said that it was “reverberating across higher education.”\n\n(Had to add this quote, as I miss our old provost.)\n\nTo many academics, that was a clear signal that Mr. Trump was prepared to use any federal mechanism as leverage if he did not get what he wants.\n\n\n“While Harvard is the victim of the moment, it’s a warning and unprecedented attempt of a hostile federal government to erode the autonomy of all major universities in the U.S.,” said John Aubrey Douglass, a senior research fellow at the Center for Studies in Higher Education at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n(Again, this week’s them. The Trump administration is all in; is higher ed?)\n\nWhile international students make up slightly more than 5 percent of university students nationwide, some of the nation’s most selective schools rely far more heavily on them. At New York University, home to nearly 60,000 students, one-third of them are international. At Columbia, about two in five students come from abroad. And at Harvard, more than a quarter of students come from across the globe.\n\n\n“This sends a signal to the rest of the world that not only is Harvard closed to the international best and brightest, but that the U.S. is not a welcome place for international students,” Mr. Lakhani said [admissions counselor in New York].\n\n\nTrump’s war on America’s Ivy League universities didn’t start with the 2023 anti-Israel protests. It was set off in 2019 by a sucker punch that left a man with a black eye.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-college-university-federal-funding-fight-91c2a274?st=4xm3Hq&reflink=article_gmail_share\n(I’m sure this rationale was used by the Project 2025 authors…)",

In the rare areas where the president — or perhaps Elon Musk — may see value in research, the emergent mafia state is almost certain to distribute funds to its friends. One shudders to think what universities would have to do to fit themselves into that category.\n\n\nSo this is my radical proposal for universities: Act like universities, not like businesses. Spend your endowments. Accept more, not fewer students. Open up your campuses and expand your reach not by buying real estate but by bringing education to communities. Create a base.

It is primarily about the acquisition of power — power for its own sake. It is a multifront assault to make the earth a playground for ruthless men, so of course any institutions that might restrain power must be weakened or destroyed. Trumpism is about ego, appetite and acquisitiveness and is driven by a primal aversion to the higher elements of the human spirit — learning, compassion, scientific wonder, the pursuit of justice.\n\n\nThese are not separate battles. This is a single effort to undo the parts of the civilizational order that might restrain Trump’s acquisition of power. And it will take a concerted response to beat it back.\n\n\nSlowly, many of us are realizing that we need to band together. But even these efforts are insular and fragmented.\n\n\nLet’s take the universities. I’ve been privileged to teach at American universities off and on for nearly 30 years and I get to visit a dozen or two others every year. These are the crown jewels of American life. They are hubs of scientific and entrepreneurial innovation.

This is what the Administration is doing by demanding Harvard accede to “viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\nThe Administration is also overstepping its authority by imposing sweeping conditions on funds that weren’t spelled out by Congress. The Justices held in Cummings (2022) that “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously” to ensure the recipient “voluntarily and knowingly accept[ed] the terms.”\n\n\nWhat Harvard Has Set the Stage For\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/harvard-university-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Thanks EI)\n\nWith these words, Harvard became the first university to officially resist the administration’s abusive intimidation, and it is urgent that it not be the only one. Its actions, supported in recent weeks in statements by other academic leaders, including the presidents of Princeton and Wesleyan, light the way forward on a vital path to fighting President Trump’s war on the independence of higher education.\n\n\nIf universities accept Mr. Trump’s terms, on the other hand, the consequence would be far greater, undermining the very purpose of an independent institution.\n\n\nHarvard Had No Choice\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/harvard-had-no-choice\n\nThus, its decision deserves either praise for courage or condemnation for foolhardiness. I choose praise — in no small part because, as we have already seen with Columbia, capitulation to President Trump’s demands brings only more demands. There’s no point in selling your soul if all you receive in exchange is a worthless IOU.\n\n\nThe anti-intellectual ideologues (no, that’s not an oxymoron) running education policy within and adjacent to the White House do not wish to reform higher education; they want to break it.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: If You’re Boycotting Columbia, Your Priorities Are All Wrong\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/columbia-university-boycott-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThen came the circular firing squad. By mid-April, 2,000 people and more than 75 organizations, most of them faculty groups, had signed onto a boycott of our events, and said they would refuse to work with Columbia scholars, like myself, a vice dean, who hold administrative positions.\n\n\nOne of the main organizers of the boycott, the City University of New York anthropologist Gary Wilder, has struggled to explain this strange form of solidarity.\n\nBut\n\nColumbia would not allow any government to deny professors their rightful role in personnel decisions or to dictate the content of our curricula. Nor would we collaborate with government agents intent on deporting our students and faculty members simply because they exercised their First Amendment rights. At no point did our leadership concede any of these essential principles, which is surely why Columbia has been under Department of Justice investigation “for harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus.”\n\n\nNow that Harvard University has decided to defy the Trump administration, the stage is set for an epic struggle, one that has already defied the expectations of cynics on both sides. After being presented with new demands, Columbia is refusing to comply. No thanks to our fair-weather friends, our acting president, Claire Shipman, has vowed to reject any agreement in which “the government dictates what we teach, research or who we hire” as well as one that would “require us to relinquish our independence and autonomy as an educational institution.” Columbia alumni are rallying in support.\n\n\nThe greatness of American universities is at risk because anti-intellectuals are undermining the foundation of academic excellence: the ability of teachers and researchers to work without political micromanagement in the pursuit of truth, even when these truths are unpopular. Colleges and universities should join a mutual defense pact, as faculty members at several universities, including Rutgers and Indiana University have proposed. If we speak with one voice, we can better articulate the essential importance of universities to the American way of life.\n\n\nWe have now seen that the Trump administration manages the economy with the same expertise and competence it manages higher education, and as a result we might begin to rally the American people. If, instead, academics choose to boycott colleagues rather than stand with them, they become accomplices in the very assault on academic freedom they wish to oppose.\n\n\n\n\n\nCornell Sues DOE for ‘Unlawful’ Cuts to Indirect Costs for Research Grants - The Cornell Daily Sun\n\nhttps://www.cornellsun.com/article/2025/04/breaking-cornell-sues-doe-following-1-billion-funding-freeze\n\nACE and others file lawsuite to prevent DOE cuts\n\nhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.283318/gov.uscourts.mad.283318.1.0.pdf\n\n\n\n\nBrown Takes Out $300 Million Loan\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/17/brown-takes-out-300-million-loan\n\nBoth Harvard University and Princeton University announced in recent weeks that they were issuing bonds.

In the rare areas where the president — or perhaps Elon Musk — may see value in research, the emergent mafia state is almost certain to distribute funds to its friends. One shudders to think what universities would have to do to fit themselves into that category.\n\n\nSo this is my radical proposal for universities: Act like universities, not like businesses. Spend your endowments. Accept more, not fewer students. Open up your campuses and expand your reach not by buying real estate but by bringing education to communities. Create a base. Become a movement.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump’s Threats Force Institutions to Choose: Cut a Deal or Fight Back\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/us/politics/trump-universities-law-firms-deals.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nAt Harvard, hundreds, including Mr. Bowie, rallied to call on the school to stand up to the Trump administration’s demands, while hundreds of faculty members signed a letter urging Harvard to condemn Mr. Trump’s attempt to remake higher education.\n\n\nAt Yale, nearly 1,000 faculty members signed a letter calling on their leaders to resist Mr. Trump’s demands.

That is why this moment is a test of our ability to step up and protect our national greatness from our national leader.\n\nNYTimes: Time for a Civic Uprising\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/opinion/trump-harvard-law-firms.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nDavid Brooks drops the partisan digs and gets right at it:\n\nTrumpism is threatening all of that. It is primarily about the acquisition of power — power for its own sake. It is a multifront assault to make the earth a playground for ruthless men, so of course any institutions that might restrain power must be weakened or destroyed. Trumpism is about ego, appetite and acquisitiveness and is driven by a primal aversion to the higher elements of the human spirit — learning, compassion, scientific wonder, the pursuit of justice.\n\n\nThese are not separate battles. This is a single effort to undo the parts of the civilizational order that might restrain Trump’s acquisition of power. And it will take a concerted response to beat it back.\n\n\nSlowly, many of us are realizing that we need to band together. But even these efforts are insular and fragmented.\n\n\nLet’s take the universities. I’ve been privileged to teach at American universities off and on for nearly 30 years and I get to visit a dozen or two others every year. These are the crown jewels of American life. They are hubs of scientific and entrepreneurial innovation. In a million ways, the scholars at universities help us understand ourselves and our world.\n\n\n\n\nHarvard’s President Says the University Will Not Comply With Trump’s Demands\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/harvards-president-says-the-university-will-not-comply-with-trumps-demands\n\nGarber said that the directives violate Harvard’s First Amendment rights, exceed the federal government’s Title VI authority, and threaten the university’s values.\n\n\nThe American Association of University Professors and its chapter at Harvard University sued the Trump administration Friday in an attempt to block the administration’s policy changes and review of nearly $9 billion in federal funding.\n\nhttps://actionnetwork.org/user_files/user_files/000/122/747/original/File_Stamped_Complaint.pdf\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Will Freeze $2 Billion After Harvard Refuses Demands\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/us/harvard-trump-reject-demands.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nStanford president and provost back Harvard in funding fight\n\nhttps://stanforddaily.com/2025/04/15/levin-martinez-back-harvard-president/\n\nYale too\n\nhttps://thehill.com/homenews/education/5250248-harvard-receives-support-from-yale-stanford/\n\nNYTimes: Why Harvard Decided to Fight Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/why-harvard-resisted-trumps-demands.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n“No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Harvard’s president, Alan M.

Martin Wolf of the Financial Times argued recently that Trump, like Mao Zedong in China more than 50 years ago, has embarked on a “cultural revolution” that seeks “to overthrow the bureaucratic and cultural elites” that are anchored in the nation’s great universities.\n\n\nLiberal professors aren’t yet forced to wear dunce caps or work in “reeducation camps” in farms and factories. Maybe that’s next.

This is what the Administration is doing by demanding Harvard accede to “viewpoint diversity.”\n\n\nThe Administration is also overstepping its authority by imposing sweeping conditions on funds that weren’t spelled out by Congress. The Justices held in Cummings (2022) that “if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously” to ensure the recipient “voluntarily and knowingly accept[ed] the terms.”\n\n\nWhat Harvard Has Set the Stage For\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/harvard-university-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Thanks EI)\n\nWith these words, Harvard became the first university to officially resist the administration’s abusive intimidation, and it is urgent that it not be the only one. Its actions, supported in recent weeks in statements by other academic leaders, including the presidents of Princeton and Wesleyan, light the way forward on a vital path to fighting President Trump’s war on the independence of higher education.\n\n\nIf universities accept Mr. Trump’s terms, on the other hand, the consequence would be far greater, undermining the very purpose of an independent institution.\n\n\nHarvard Had No Choice\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/harvard-had-no-choice\n\nThus, its decision deserves either praise for courage or condemnation for foolhardiness. I choose praise — in no small part because, as we have already seen with Columbia, capitulation to President Trump’s demands brings only more demands. There’s no point in selling your soul if all you receive in exchange is a worthless IOU.\n\n\nThe anti-intellectual ideologues (no, that’s not an oxymoron) running education policy within and adjacent to the White House do not wish to reform higher education; they want to break it.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: If You’re Boycotting Columbia, Your Priorities Are All Wrong\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/opinion/columbia-university-boycott-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThen came the circular firing squad. By mid-April, 2,000 people and more than 75 organizations, most of them faculty groups, had signed onto a boycott of our events, and said they would refuse to work with Columbia scholars, like myself, a vice dean, who hold administrative positions.\n\n\nOne of the main organizers of the boycott, the City University of New York anthropologist Gary Wilder, has struggled to explain this strange form of solidarity.\n\nBut\n\nColumbia would not allow any government to deny professors their rightful role in personnel decisions or to dictate the content of our curricula. Nor would we collaborate with government agents intent on deporting our students and faculty members simply because they exercised their First Amendment rights. At no point did our leadership concede any of these essential principles, which is surely why Columbia has been under Department of Justice investigation “for harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus.”\n\n\nNow that Harvard University has decided to defy the Trump administration, the stage is set for an epic struggle, one that has already defied the expectations of cynics on both sides. After being presented with new demands, Columbia is refusing to comply. No thanks to our fair-weather friends, our acting president, Claire Shipman, has vowed to reject any agreement in which “the government dictates what we teach, research or who we hire” as well as one that would “require us to relinquish our independence and autonomy as an educational institution.” Columbia alumni are rallying in support.\n\n\nThe greatness of American universities is at risk because anti-intellectuals are undermining the foundation of academic excellence: the ability of teachers and researchers to work without political micromanagement in the pursuit of truth, even when these truths are unpopular. Colleges and universities should join a mutual defense pact, as faculty members at several universities, including Rutgers and Indiana University have proposed. If we speak with one voice, we can better articulate the essential importance of universities to the American way of life.\n\n\nWe have now seen that the Trump administration manages the economy with the same expertise and competence it manages higher education, and as a result we might begin to rally the American people. If, instead, academics choose to boycott colleagues rather than stand with them, they become accomplices in the very assault on academic freedom they wish to oppose.\n\n\n\n\n\nCornell Sues DOE for ‘Unlawful’ Cuts to Indirect Costs for Research Grants - The Cornell Daily Sun\n\nhttps://www.cornellsun.com/article/2025/04/breaking-cornell-sues-doe-following-1-billion-funding-freeze\n\nACE and others file lawsuite to prevent DOE cuts\n\nhttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.283318/gov.uscourts.mad.283318.1.0.pdf\n\n\n\n\nBrown Takes Out $300 Million Loan\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/04/17/brown-takes-out-300-million-loan\n\nBoth Harvard University and Princeton University announced in recent weeks that they were issuing bonds.

Errors will prove costly to borrowers and ultimately, to taxpayers.”\n\n\nNYTimes: ‘Chaos and Confusion’ at the Crown Jewel of American Science\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/health/nih-doge-trump.html\n\nA week after Donald J. Trump was inaugurated, a senior scientist at the National Institutes of Health was preparing to give an invited talk at a scientific meeting when an urgent call came in from an administrative assistant.\n\n\nThere is a total communications ban, the scientist was told, and you cannot give the speech.\n\n\nAs soon as the scientist got back to the office, another ban went into effect — one that prohibited researchers from submitting papers to journals for publication.\n\n\nOne said that DOGE had begun a reign of “chaos and confusion.”\n\n\nHundreds of highly competitive grants that support research at universities and medical schools across the country have been cut. Many of the eliminated grants had descriptions that included terms like “minorities,” “transgender,” “AIDS” and “vaccine hesitancy.” But cuts have also affected research on the chronic diseases that Mr. Kennedy has made his priority; for instance, funding has been cut for a grant to Columbia University for a study that has followed people who have diabetes or are at risk of developing it for more than a quarter-century\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Faculty Protests as Trump Officials Hail University Concessions\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/columbia-trump-response.html\n\nEarlier on Monday, at least 50 professors turned out in a steady drizzle outside the campus gates to protest the funding cuts and what they criticized as Columbia’s conciliatory response. The professors said they hoped to be the vanguard of a resistance movement among academics that remains, for now, at an early stage.\n\n\n“We need to stand up, all of us,” said Michael Thaddeus, a mathematics professor at Columbia and vice president of the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors, speaking to the crowd. “We need to organize, from the grass roots to the national level. If we lead, our leaders will follow.”\n\nNYTimes: ‘It Is Hard to Imagine a More Sweeping Agenda to Make Americans Less Healthy’\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/trump-toxins-cancer-environment.html\nScroll down to find\n\nTurning to the issue of medical research, Duke University provides a case study of the problems facing higher education institutions that are struggling to maintain research budgets under the Trump administration.\n\n\nDonald McDonnell, a professor of molecular cancer biology at Duke whose laboratory has received $40 million from N.I.H. over 30 years, told the A.P. that his lab is likely to go into the red because of the uncertainty of N.I.H. grants, forcing him to order layoffs: “The bottom line is, I can’t live, I can’t think in this chaos,” McDonnell said.\n\n\nThe threatened cuts, according to McDonnell, have endangered the next generation of researchers. Duke medical school has reduced the number of Ph.D. students it will admit from 130 this year to 100 or even fewer in the next academic year.\n\n\nWP: EPA knew it wrongfully canceled dozens of environmental grants, documents show\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/03/25/epa-environment-grants-wrongful-termination/\n\nJulia Haggerty, an associate professor of geography at Montana State University, worked with local partners for almost a year to assemble a competitive application to create a program designed to provide technical assistance and resources to underserved communities.\n\n\nBeginning in January, the program’s funding oscillated between being frozen and unfrozen. The EPA terminated the grant on Feb. 21, saying the “award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities,” according to an email reviewed by The Post.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: As Trump’s Policies Worry Scientists, France and Others Put Out a Welcome Mat\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/europe-trump-science-research.html\n\nthe university [Aix Marseille University] in the south of France known for its science programs, has received about a dozen applications per day from what the school considers “scientific asylum” seekers.\n\n\nIf the movement becomes a trend, it could mean the reversal of the long-term brain drain that has seen generations of scientists move to the United States.\n\n\nFallout from Columbia capitulation fuels fears about academic freedom\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/03/24/fallout-columbia-capitulation-fuels-fears-about-academic-freedom/\n\n“I’m worried that the university’s decision could change how civil rights enforcement works,” Erickson said. “If the Trump administration can declare by fiat that the university is in violation of Title VI protections and withhold funding on that basis — without due process or review — every school district in this country could potentially be told that they are in violation of civil rights law and asked to negotiate.”\n\n\nTrump-Inflicted Funding Cuts Could Lead to Overworked Faculty and Staff, Larger Class Sizes\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-inflicted-funding-cuts-could-lead-to-overworked-faculty-and-staff-larger-class-sizes\n\nWhile the federal government’s $76 billion in emergency aid to higher education from 2020 to 2022 helped colleges get through the Covid financial crisis, research universities may be facing an even more significant financial threat this time around\n\n\nDon’t visit the US – it just isn’t worth the risks right now | Arwa Mahdawi | The Guardian\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/25/dont-visit-the-us-it-just-isnt-worth-the-risks-right-now\n(This was posted in a discussion about holding international conferences in the US.)\n*What Rural Universities Stand to Lose Under Trump’s DEI, Higher Education Cuts — ProPublica\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/regional-public-universities-trump-funding-dei\n\nThat’s because diversity also means something more in regional public universities: Many students at SIU come from families that are poor, or barely middle class, and depend on scholarships and mentorship to succeed. Paul Frazier, SIU’s vice chancellor for anti-racism, diversity, equity and inclusion, said the way DEI has been politicized ignores what it actually does: “Poor doesn’t have a color.”\n\n\n\n\n\nColumbia University caves to demands to restore $400m from Trump administration\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/21/columbia-university-funding-trump-demands\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/facing-a-loss-of-400-million-columbia-u-concedes-to-trumps-demands\n\nNYTimes: Adams Uses Agency ‘Tracker’ to Control Messaging on Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/adams-trump-tracker.html\n\nThe mayor’s office has avoided discussing “Know Your Rights” guidance on how immigrants should respond to federal immigration officials and gender-affirming health care for transgender people, according to one of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\n\nUniversity leaders, pinned between liberal faculty and the Trump administration, are quietly trying to make friends in Washington\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/universities-trump-lobbyists-funding-washington-a2e5c77a?st=j5R8xP&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nNow few House lawmakers—and virtually no Republicans—are interested in going to bat for higher education, lobbyists, trade groups and officials said.\n\n\nDozens of schools, including the University of California system and Harvard, have paused hiring amid concerns over the future of federal funding. The National Institutes of Health normally provides billions of dollars to universities every year for medical and public-health research. Proposed cuts to that funding are now being challenged in courts. In the meantime, some schools have rescinded admission offers to graduate students.\n\n\nWhile many faculty members argue universities shouldn’t yield to Trump, they are in a tricky spot. It isn’t uncommon for a quarter or more of the operating budget of a large university to come from federal sources in the forms of student loans, Pell Grants and research funding—research that supporters say goes on to produce innovations and fuel the broader economy.\n\n\nTrump’s actions constitute a “war on civil society,” Roth [Wesleyan PResident] has told Connecticut lawmakers.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s insecurity state\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4izVKU2\n\n[Trump post] While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House House Governor’s Conference,” he posted, “we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House House Governor’s Conference,” he posted, “we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases.\n\n\nHis administration has also gone after Columbia University, demanding that the school make concessions to not lose $400 million in federal funding. Apparently failing to understand that extortion is rarely a one-time deal, the university agreed to the concessions. (Sure enough, a senior Justice Department official indicated in a recent radio interview that more concessions would be needed.)\n\n\nSo much of what orbits the president is held in place by the gravitational pull of his insecurity.\n\n\nColumbia Capitulated — But So Did the Rest of Higher Ed (Thanks Kimora)\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/columbia-capitulated-but-so-did-the-rest-of-higher-ed\n\n“Unless higher education discovers its collective nerve and collective voice, those who “threaten the very mission of the university and its values of free inquiry” will get precisely what they want. And if it allows such a thing to happen without putting up more of a fight in defense of its mission and social purpose, higher education — it deeply pains me to acknowledge — will get what it deserves.”\n\n\nThis is why all our statements on academic freedom are important. My hope is that they give our political and university leaders some pause before they violate academic freedom as easily as they recently did at Hunter. Moreover, they show how each governing body is dealing with the challenges to higher education, and thus preparing their constituents for the challenges to come.\n\n(Thanks EI)\n\nNYTimes: University of Michigan to Scuttle Its Flagship D.E.I.

But it may not pass. Even if it does, the universities that survive may be weakened, frightened shadows of their former selves.\n\n\nNYTimes: ‘This Is Worse’: Trump’s Judicial Defiance Veers Beyond the Autocrat Playbook\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/europe/trump-courts-defiance-autocrats-playbook.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(While not about higher education, this article compares the Trump Adminstrations to other autocratic regime’s approach to capturing the judicial system.)\n\n“We look at these comparative cases in the 21st century, like Hungary and Poland and Turkey. And in a lot of respects, this is worse,” he said. “These first two months have been much more aggressively authoritarian than almost any other comparable case I know of democratic backsliding.”\n\n\nTrump can’t fix American universities by breaking them\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4bOsq9T\n\nFlorida pioneered the kind of crackdown the Trump administration is attempting, and now more left-leaning students and professors in that state have begun describing exactly the kind of speech-chilling atmosphere that conservatives have been complaining about for years. Professors there have steered students away from discussing topics that seem forbidden, including “intersectionality,” and are afraid that students are recording them, the Wall Street Journal has reported. Students voiced similar fears that classmates would broadcast their remarks on social media, and one student publication trimmed its coverage to protect its funding\n\n\nNYTimes: $15 Billion Is Enough to Fight a President\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/trump-university-endowment-spending.html\n\nThus far, university presidents have largely kept their heads down rather than uniting to oppose Mr. Trump’s assault. That is a mistake. A key authoritarian strategy is to single out prominent individuals or institutions for repression so that others, afraid, forgo legitimate criticism of the authoritarian leader. Often, universities are some of the first institutions that authoritarians attack. Make no mistake, the Trump administration’s punitive cuts to federal research grants and detention of university students or faculty, couched under the President’s grievances over diversity programs and campus protests, are early signs of this strategy at work in America.\n\n\nLegal scholars on what Columbia University should have done — and what other colleges could do next.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/it-is-remarkable-how-quickly-the-chill-has-descended\n\nwith the exceptions of the presidents of Brown and Princeton, the leadership of academia has been pretty much absent; everyone is taking a duck-and-cover attitude. So Armstrong [Columbia’s President] felt she was on her own. That’s my most sympathetic read, even though I wish she had taken a firmer stand.\n\n\nSo there’s this very rational cost-benefit analysis where administrators are thinking, “Well, if we speak up and others do not …” It’s a collective-action problem in which, in the moment, it’s always easier not to speak. This is why we have free-speech protections — speech is easily chilled. It is remarkable how quickly the chill has descended.\n\n\nA less sympathetic reading: My sense of what was motivating both the Paul Weiss and Columbia leadership is a view that the concessions being demanded were not very significant.\n\n\nThat in itself is a significant indication of where we are. I’ve been reading all the free-speech policies at different schools. There’s lovely language in the policies about how universities are sites of dissent and how protest is meant to be valued. About how we want to give our students the freedom to question what is in the classroom and what’s outside the classroom. Chicago has a wonderful statement written by David Strauss, who was the head of the ad-hoc committee on protest and dissent, in which he says protest is not only integral to the life of the university because we are a community of dissent, but administrators should strive to problem-solve. So when students break the rules, don’t use discipline. Try to figure out what the cause of their concern is. Since October 7, there has been a demise of that kind of talking and that kind of imagining.\n\n\nIt feels like we are saying goodbye to this beautiful democratic vision of the university and we are now thinking of the university as a place where order must be maintained.\n\n\nThis Time, Higher Ed’s Resistance to Trump is Being Led by Its Associations\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/this-time-higher-eds-resistance-to-trump-is-being-led-by-its-associations\n(The board of ACE is chaired by CUNY’s Chancellor.)\n\nin opening remarks at ACE’s annual conference, Mitchell [ACE’s President] condemned Trump’s actions in unusually strong words. “The flurry of these threats,” he said, “were designed to cow us into silence. When we face threats, we will not cower.”\n\n\nTo Todd Wolfson, president of the AAUP, doing so [joining a lawsuite] was a necessity. “It’s our job to protect our members and to protect their places of employment and their sector,” he said. “If somebody wants to argue with me that’s not the role of unions and associations, I’d love to hear it. But I think this is a fundamental duty of ours, if not the fundamental duty.”\n\n\nNYTimes: David Leonhardt on How Universities Can Stop Trump’s ‘Destroying Agenda’\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/opinion/universities-trump-fight-back.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLeonhardt: It’s important to say that a lot of the conservative critics of universities, including Christopher Rufo, also don’t want a fully open debate. They want to restrict debate in many cases so that it’s just their view of the world. They want to take books out of schools about L.G.B.T. people. That’s really damaging.\n\n\nA world in which Donald Trump’s ideological enforcers are going through a course catalog or telling schools exactly what their admissions policies need to be, rather than letting schools follow the Supreme Court ruling on it, would be a really damaging world.\n\n\nI think we’re on track at a lot of universities and also law firms and other institutions that you’ve written about where people are going to say: Well, can I make a deal with Trump or can I keep my head down and stay out of the line of fire? Maybe not appreciating that this guy and the people around him like Chris Rufo are on a war footing.\n\n\nDear Colleagues: The Time for Boldness Is Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/03/27/letter-faculty-self-censorship-and-boldness-opinion\n\nI do not deny that we are living in perilous times, but what good are academic freedom and tenure if we do not use them? Some think, I believe mistakenly, that speaking out will only embolden the attacks on higher education institutions and faculty. I, instead, am more compelled by Frederick Douglass’s proclamation, “Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted …”\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: U.S. Lodges New Accusations Against Detained Columbia Protest Leader\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/23/nyregion/mahmoud-khalil-trump-allegations.html\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be using the new allegations in part to sidestep the First Amendment issues raised by Mr. Khalil’s case. On Sunday, in a filing opposing his release, Justice Department lawyers argued that the new allegations reduced the importance of concerns about Mr. Khalil’s right to free speech.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow an Accreditation War Could Start\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-an-accreditation-war-could-start\n\nNow President Trump threatens to wield accreditation as a weapon, something which, if carried out, would muzzle the creativity and innovation that has fueled America’s lead.\n\n\nWhat stands in Trump’s way? The federal law establishing the Department of Education prohibits federal interference in curricular matters. That federal law would change, however, if the department is eliminated.\n\n\nAnother obstacle is the First Amendment: If the administration were to directly attack accreditors’ opinions or academic perspectives, they would expose themselves to legal challenges. The administration could respond to this by claiming a national-security concern (say, holding that diversity, equity, and inclusion are part of a Marxist threat to America).\n\n\nIf you have stories you would like me to include in anticipated future digests, please send along via an email to me directly (john.verzani@csi.cuny.edu).",

Trump was inaugurated, a senior scientist at the National Institutes of Health was preparing to give an invited talk at a scientific meeting when an urgent call came in from an administrative assistant.\n\n\nThere is a total communications ban, the scientist was told, and you cannot give the speech.\n\n\nAs soon as the scientist got back to the office, another ban went into effect — one that prohibited researchers from submitting papers to journals for publication.\n\n\nOne said that DOGE had begun a reign of “chaos and confusion.”\n\n\nHundreds of highly competitive grants that support research at universities and medical schools across the country have been cut. Many of the eliminated grants had descriptions that included terms like “minorities,” “transgender,” “AIDS” and “vaccine hesitancy.” But cuts have also affected research on the chronic diseases that Mr. Kennedy has made his priority; for instance, funding has been cut for a grant to Columbia University for a study that has followed people who have diabetes or are at risk of developing it for more than a quarter-century\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Faculty Protests as Trump Officials Hail University Concessions\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/columbia-trump-response.html\n\nEarlier on Monday, at least 50 professors turned out in a steady drizzle outside the campus gates to protest the funding cuts and what they criticized as Columbia’s conciliatory response. The professors said they hoped to be the vanguard of a resistance movement among academics that remains, for now, at an early stage.\n\n\n“We need to stand up, all of us,” said Michael Thaddeus, a mathematics professor at Columbia and vice president of the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors, speaking to the crowd. “We need to organize, from the grass roots to the national level. If we lead, our leaders will follow.”\n\nNYTimes: ‘It Is Hard to Imagine a More Sweeping Agenda to Make Americans Less Healthy’\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/trump-toxins-cancer-environment.html\nScroll down to find\n\nTurning to the issue of medical research, Duke University provides a case study of the problems facing higher education institutions that are struggling to maintain research budgets under the Trump administration.\n\n\nDonald McDonnell, a professor of molecular cancer biology at Duke whose laboratory has received $40 million from N.I.H. over 30 years, told the A.P. that his lab is likely to go into the red because of the uncertainty of N.I.H. grants, forcing him to order layoffs: “The bottom line is, I can’t live, I can’t think in this chaos,” McDonnell said.\n\n\nThe threatened cuts, according to McDonnell, have endangered the next generation of researchers. Duke medical school has reduced the number of Ph.D. students it will admit from 130 this year to 100 or even fewer in the next academic year.\n\n\nWP: EPA knew it wrongfully canceled dozens of environmental grants, documents show\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/03/25/epa-environment-grants-wrongful-termination/\n\nJulia Haggerty, an associate professor of geography at Montana State University, worked with local partners for almost a year to assemble a competitive application to create a program designed to provide technical assistance and resources to underserved communities.\n\n\nBeginning in January, the program’s funding oscillated between being frozen and unfrozen. The EPA terminated the grant on Feb. 21, saying the “award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities,” according to an email reviewed by The Post.",

The National Institutes of Health normally provides billions of dollars to universities every year for medical and public-health research. Proposed cuts to that funding are now being challenged in courts. In the meantime, some schools have rescinded admission offers to graduate students.\n\n\nWhile many faculty members argue universities shouldn’t yield to Trump, they are in a tricky spot. It isn’t uncommon for a quarter or more of the operating budget of a large university to come from federal sources in the forms of student loans, Pell Grants and research funding—research that supporters say goes on to produce innovations and fuel the broader economy.\n\n\nTrump’s actions constitute a “war on civil society,” Roth [Wesleyan PResident] has told Connecticut lawmakers.\n\n\nDonald Trump’s insecurity state\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4izVKU2\n\n[Trump post] While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House House Governor’s Conference,” he posted, “we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House House Governor’s Conference,” he posted, “we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases.\n\n\nHis administration has also gone after Columbia University, demanding that the school make concessions to not lose $400 million in federal funding. Apparently failing to understand that extortion is rarely a one-time deal, the university agreed to the concessions. (Sure enough, a senior Justice Department official indicated in a recent radio interview that more concessions would be needed.)\n\n\nSo much of what orbits the president is held in place by the gravitational pull of his insecurity.\n\n\nColumbia Capitulated — But So Did the Rest of Higher Ed (Thanks Kimora)\n\nhttps://www-chronicle-com.csi.ezproxy.cuny.edu/article/columbia-capitulated-but-so-did-the-rest-of-higher-ed\n\n“Unless higher education discovers its collective nerve and collective voice, those who “threaten the very mission of the university and its values of free inquiry” will get precisely what they want. And if it allows such a thing to happen without putting up more of a fight in defense of its mission and social purpose, higher education — it deeply pains me to acknowledge — will get what it deserves.”\n\n\nThis is why all our statements on academic freedom are important. My hope is that they give our political and university leaders some pause before they violate academic freedom as easily as they recently did at Hunter. Moreover, they show how each governing body is dealing with the challenges to higher education, and thus preparing their constituents for the challenges to come.\n\n(Thanks EI)\n\nNYTimes: University of Michigan to Scuttle Its Flagship D.E.I.

But it may not pass. Even if it does, the universities that survive may be weakened, frightened shadows of their former selves.\n\n\nNYTimes: ‘This Is Worse’: Trump’s Judicial Defiance Veers Beyond the Autocrat Playbook\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/world/europe/trump-courts-defiance-autocrats-playbook.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(While not about higher education, this article compares the Trump Adminstrations to other autocratic regime’s approach to capturing the judicial system.)\n\n“We look at these comparative cases in the 21st century, like Hungary and Poland and Turkey. And in a lot of respects, this is worse,” he said. “These first two months have been much more aggressively authoritarian than almost any other comparable case I know of democratic backsliding.”\n\n\nTrump can’t fix American universities by breaking them\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4bOsq9T\n\nFlorida pioneered the kind of crackdown the Trump administration is attempting, and now more left-leaning students and professors in that state have begun describing exactly the kind of speech-chilling atmosphere that conservatives have been complaining about for years. Professors there have steered students away from discussing topics that seem forbidden, including “intersectionality,” and are afraid that students are recording them, the Wall Street Journal has reported. Students voiced similar fears that classmates would broadcast their remarks on social media, and one student publication trimmed its coverage to protect its funding\n\n\nNYTimes: $15 Billion Is Enough to Fight a President\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/opinion/trump-university-endowment-spending.html\n\nThus far, university presidents have largely kept their heads down rather than uniting to oppose Mr. Trump’s assault. That is a mistake. A key authoritarian strategy is to single out prominent individuals or institutions for repression so that others, afraid, forgo legitimate criticism of the authoritarian leader. Often, universities are some of the first institutions that authoritarians attack. Make no mistake, the Trump administration’s punitive cuts to federal research grants and detention of university students or faculty, couched under the President’s grievances over diversity programs and campus protests, are early signs of this strategy at work in America.\n\n\nLegal scholars on what Columbia University should have done — and what other colleges could do next.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/it-is-remarkable-how-quickly-the-chill-has-descended\n\nwith the exceptions of the presidents of Brown and Princeton, the leadership of academia has been pretty much absent; everyone is taking a duck-and-cover attitude. So Armstrong [Columbia’s President] felt she was on her own. That’s my most sympathetic read, even though I wish she had taken a firmer stand.\n\n\nSo there’s this very rational cost-benefit analysis where administrators are thinking, “Well, if we speak up and others do not …” It’s a collective-action problem in which, in the moment, it’s always easier not to speak. This is why we have free-speech protections — speech is easily chilled. It is remarkable how quickly the chill has descended.\n\n\nA less sympathetic reading: My sense of what was motivating both the Paul Weiss and Columbia leadership is a view that the concessions being demanded were not very significant.\n\n\nThat in itself is a significant indication of where we are. I’ve been reading all the free-speech policies at different schools. There’s lovely language in the policies about how universities are sites of dissent and how protest is meant to be valued. About how we want to give our students the freedom to question what is in the classroom and what’s outside the classroom. Chicago has a wonderful statement written by David Strauss, who was the head of the ad-hoc committee on protest and dissent, in which he says protest is not only integral to the life of the university because we are a community of dissent, but administrators should strive to problem-solve. So when students break the rules, don’t use discipline. Try to figure out what the cause of their concern is. Since October 7, there has been a demise of that kind of talking and that kind of imagining.\n\n\nIt feels like we are saying goodbye to this beautiful democratic vision of the university and we are now thinking of the university as a place where order must be maintained.\n\n\nThis Time, Higher Ed’s Resistance to Trump is Being Led by Its Associations\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/this-time-higher-eds-resistance-to-trump-is-being-led-by-its-associations\n(The board of ACE is chaired by CUNY’s Chancellor.)\n\nin opening remarks at ACE’s annual conference, Mitchell [ACE’s President] condemned Trump’s actions in unusually strong words. “The flurry of these threats,” he said, “were designed to cow us into silence. When we face threats, we will not cower.”\n\n\nTo Todd Wolfson, president of the AAUP, doing so [joining a lawsuite] was a necessity. “It’s our job to protect our members and to protect their places of employment and their sector,” he said. “If somebody wants to argue with me that’s not the role of unions and associations, I’d love to hear it. But I think this is a fundamental duty of ours, if not the fundamental duty.”\n\n\nNYTimes: David Leonhardt on How Universities Can Stop Trump’s ‘Destroying Agenda’\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/opinion/universities-trump-fight-back.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLeonhardt: It’s important to say that a lot of the conservative critics of universities, including Christopher Rufo, also don’t want a fully open debate. They want to restrict debate in many cases so that it’s just their view of the world. They want to take books out of schools about L.G.B.T. people. That’s really damaging.\n\n\nA world in which Donald Trump’s ideological enforcers are going through a course catalog or telling schools exactly what their admissions policies need to be, rather than letting schools follow the Supreme Court ruling on it, would be a really damaging world.\n\n\nI think we’re on track at a lot of universities and also law firms and other institutions that you’ve written about where people are going to say: Well, can I make a deal with Trump or can I keep my head down and stay out of the line of fire? Maybe not appreciating that this guy and the people around him like Chris Rufo are on a war footing.\n\n\nDear Colleagues: The Time for Boldness Is Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/03/27/letter-faculty-self-censorship-and-boldness-opinion\n\nI do not deny that we are living in perilous times, but what good are academic freedom and tenure if we do not use them? Some think, I believe mistakenly, that speaking out will only embolden the attacks on higher education institutions and faculty. I, instead, am more compelled by Frederick Douglass’s proclamation, “Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted …”",

It awards grants that fund research fellowships, programs at museums and historic sites, website development and documentary filmmaking, among a host of other projects related to the public humanities. But it also disburses a great chunk of its appropriation — some $65 million of an annual budget of roughly $210 million — directly to nonprofit humanities councils in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and five territories.\n\n\nStaff cuts begin at NEH, threatening humanities programs across U.S.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2025/04/10/neh-staff-cuts-reduction-in-force/\n\nTrump Presents Harvard With an Ultimatum for Federal Funds\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/04/trump-sets-demands-harvard-must-meet-regain-federal\n\nThe ultimatum came just three days after the president’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism notified the university it had been placed under review for its alleged failure to protect Jewish students and faculty from discrimination. If the case follows the precedent set at other universities, Harvard and its affiliate medical institutions could lose up to $9 billion in federal grants and contracts if they do not comply.\n\n\nSources say the move is driven less by true concern about antisemitism on campus than by the government’s desire to abolish diversity efforts and hobble higher ed institutions it deems too “woke.” This week alone, the administration has retracted funds from Brown and Princeton Universities. Before that, it targeted the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University and opened dozens of civil rights investigations at other colleges, all of which are ongoing.\n\n(Also https://www.chronicle.com/article/trump-demands-harvard-eradicate-dei-to-preserve-its-federal-funding)\n\nNYTimes: Columbia’s Former Leader Faced Contentious Interview After Resigning\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/nyregion/columbia-president-armstrong-federal-deposition.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe hearing transcript provided an inside glimpse of the tension between Columbia and representatives of the Trump administration’s multiagency antisemitism task force, which is investigating at least 10 universities in an effort to root out what it sees as disturbing antisemitic activity on campuses.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Freezes $1 Billion for Cornell and $790 Million for Northwestern, Officials Say\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/us/politics/cornell-northwestern-university-funds-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe moves are the latest and largest in a rapidly escalating campaign against elite American universities that has resulted in billions in federal funds being suspended or put under review in just over a month. Other schools that have had funds threatened include Brown, Columbia, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton.\n\n\nNorthwestern, a Big Ten university, is the first non-Ivy League school to have funding from the Trump administration targeted under investigations of alleged discrimination. The university issued a “progress report” last week that highlighted its efforts to protect Jewish students, including mandatory antisemitism training for all students, faculty and staff.\n\nAlso reported on here\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-team-to-freeze-nearly-2-billion-at-cornell-and-northwestern-universities-2e13a88a?st=BJbjFN&reflink=article_gmail_share\nand elsewhere\n\nNYTimes: Trump Has Targeted These Universities.

Education Secretary Linda McMahon said last month that she believed Columbia was “on the right track” toward final negotiations to unfreeze the research funds.\n\n\nInstead, the Trump administration has gone in the opposite direction, cutting off even more research funding. According to Science, the NIH froze Columbia’s funding Monday at the direction of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH is reportedly not only blocking new funding but also ceasing payments for work on existing projects. In addition, the agency will require prior approval to tap existing disbursements.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: When Trump Is Done, What Will Remain of Public Education?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/opinion/trump-k-12-education.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nA longer piece on the history of the DOE and education in US history\n\nAmerica’s story is one of progress, which has rarely been obtained simply through good will. It has to be enforced. Fights for equality have been messy, and quite bloody at times. Understanding that history is important so as not to repeat it. Still, shortly before leaving office in 2020, Mr. Trump established the President’s Advisory 1776 Commission, in part a rebuttal to the 1619 Project, as a way for the administration to write its own version of American history.\n\n\nThe president’s vision to take a sledgehammer to the Department of Education’s ability to function will cause student suffering. The founders believed that education was critical to the full experience of citizenship; it was where students learned arts, sciences, humanities and how to engage with one another. But putting that vision into place left the nation with a system where inequities — in content and classroom composition — were left in place.\n\n\nAmerica began to undo those inequities, and the department protected that progress. Now, less than three months into Mr. Trump’s second presidency, the administration has done everything in its power, and some things beyond its authority, to ensure we are equal no more.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump cancels dozens of international student visas at UC, Stanford - Los Angeles Times\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-05/trump-administration-cancels-international-student-visas-university-of-california-stanford\n\nAt UC San Diego, Chancellor Pradeep Khosla said in a campus message late Friday that five students had their visas revoked. He said the university received the notification “without warning.” Khosla said a sixth student was “detained at the border, denied entry and deported to their home country.”\n\n\nA University of California statement said that “several” campuses had students who lost their visa status but did not offer more details.\n\n\nTrump Admin Broadens Scope of Student Visa Terminations\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/04/08/trump-admin-broadens-scope-student-visa\n\nInside Higher Ed uncovered dozens of visa terminations that have not been reported elsewhere, many of them at regional public universities and small private colleges.\n\n\nCUNY is not immune\n\nThere are reports that over 20 CUNY students have had SEVIS visa issues (Student and Exchange Visitor Program)\nhttps://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/education/2025/04/09/department-of-homeland-security-revokes-student-visas-at-cuny-and-fordham–schools-say\nhttps://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/09/trump-administration-cancels-dozens-of-student-visas-at-nyu-cuny-other-ny-schools/\n\nTracking Trump’s Actions on Student Visas\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-actions-on-student-visas\n\nWith secret moves against international students, feds spread fear\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/09/international-student-visas-revoked-trump-deportation-fears/\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Columbia Displays More Aggressive Posture in Dealing With Demonstrators\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/nyregion/columbia-security-protesters-removed.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nA new, more assertive stance was on display on Wednesday, as the university’s officers intervened to stop a daylong demonstration of students, most of whom were Jewish, who had chained themselves to the campus’s wrought-iron gates.\n\n\nMoving to end the protest, public safety officers cut or untangled the students from their chains at about 11:15 p.m., and then physically picked them up before escorting them from campus. The officers carried at least one student off the lawn, according to video posted on social media and student interviews.\n\n\nHow conservatives are using Columbia as a ‘test case’ to enforce Trump’s agenda\n\nhttps://wapo.st/43EUxWX\nThis is an important analysis of the playbook being employed and it references what appears to be another Chris Rufo type.\n\nCritical of college admissions, diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and campus protests that he lambasted as pro-Hamas, Max Eden, then a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote an outline that presaged what was to come in the new Trump administration. He singled out Columbia as the top target.\n\n\n “To scare universities straight,” Eden wrote in the Washington Examiner [https://www.aei.org/op-eds/a-comprehensive-guide-to-overhauling-higher-education/] , Education Secretary Linda McMahon “should start by taking a prize scalp. She should simply destroy Columbia University.”\n\n\nOn the day the administration canceled the federal funding to the school, a senior Trump administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, described Columbia as a “test case” for using funding to pressure colleges to comply with Trump’s ideology.\n\n\n“We’re going to bankrupt these universities,” Leo Terrell, leader of the recently formed Justice Department task force on antisemitism, said on Fox News after the cuts to Columbia were announced.\n\n\n“They are targeting private institutions of education and attempting to police and control speech, political expression and thought. And that is truly unprecedented,” said Orion Danjuma, counsel at Protect Democracy, which is representing the unions alongside the law firm Altshuler Berzon. “Columbia is the testing ground for this. It’s a canary in the coal mine.”\n\n\nOther changes are not an exact match to the administration’s demands. The university is not abolishing its judicial board that oversees disciplinary cases as requested. But it will remove students from participating and give the provost oversight. It is not putting the Middle East, South Asian and African Studies department in academic receivership for five years as the administration wanted. That academic department will undergo a review by the provost’s office.\n\n\n“This was planned,” said Reinhold Martin, president of Columbia’s chapter of the AAUP. “We’ve seen the script. The assault on Columbia is going according to that script.”\n\nAs for the Eden piece here are his talking points:\n\nCutting Off Federal Funding – Columbia was, perhaps, the worst offender in indulging the pro-Hamas campus radicals. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights should initiate a compliance review of every single decision Columbia made. To do that, OCR would need the identities of every single foreign student who supported the protests, actions the Trump administration could deem material support of a terrorist organization. Border czar Tom Homan could then revoke every single one of the foreign protesting students’ visas. If Columbia doesn’t cooperate, McMahon could cut off its research grant funding.\n\n\nRemoving Foreign Money from Higher Education – And while the Trump administration is looking into Columbia, the Justice Department should thoroughly explore indicting former Columbia President Lee Bollinger for fraud if he, through commission or omission, played a role in Columbia’s submission of inaccurate data to US News and World Report. Bollinger submitted the data to boost Columbia’s rank in the report. Once the true data were reported, Columbia’s rank fell from second to 18th. College presidents regard Bollinger as perhaps the greatest college leader of the 21st century. He should be regarded as the worst. Perhaps the college presidents could learn a valuable lesson from the sight of him in an orange jumpsuit.\n\n\nThe second target should be the University of California, Los Angeles. UCLA’s …\n\n\nEnforcing Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard; he first step should be forcing Harvard University to comply. Right after the decision was issued, Harvard all but publicly vowed to do everything in its power to violate the spirit of the Supreme Court’s ruling and the 14th Amendment on which it was based. McMahon should initiate a never-ending compliance review to ensure that Harvard follows the law. … If OCR finds a shred of evidence of racial discrimination, Harvard should lose its Title IV funds. I\n\n\nAnd so many other universities have essentially forfeited the privilege of picking their own professors.\n\n\nThe University of Washington and UIC should be forced to pay back wages to every single white applicant they declined to hire over a DEI statement and hire as many as would still like to work there. … However, it could demand all documents and correspondence on hiring in every university faculty department that implemented DEI statements. It could then train an artificial intelligence model to sort through the records and flag likely discrimination. Trump staffers could then send internal, FOIA-able correspondence regarding hot spots of likely discrimination. … Enterprising trial attorneys could team up with starving adjunct professors, and universities could be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement fees. That would teach them a painful lesson: Hiring based on race rather than academic merit comes at a very high cost.\n\n\nHow Trump can Destroy DEI on Campus – it’s all stereotyping. DEI violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment when stereotyping is institutionalized and promoted in an educational institution receiving federal funding — or so the Trump administration should hold and enforce. … To assure compliance with the 14th Amendment, McMahon could task accreditors with ensuring that students aren’t forced to take DEI-infused courses to graduate. This would, essentially, take Florida’s policy of removing DEI from general education requirements national. When students aren’t forced to take these courses, far fewer will, and the radical Marxists will lose students and influence. … McMahon could also champion college students’ First Amendment rights by forcing colleges to dismantle their so-called “Bias Reporting Systems.” More than half of colleges encourage students to snitch on each other for saying something “biased,” and students suspected of wrong speak are then hauled in front of a campus tribunal of DEI administrators.\n\n\nShaking Up College Accreditation – Trump suggested he would simply fire all the existing accreditors. That could prove prohibitively difficult. But Trump could easily decimate the worst of them: the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. … Trump could also easily expedite the approval of additional accreditors. These accreditors could provide a much more streamlined, cost-effective, outcomes-oriented paradigm than the existing set. They could also specialize in helping to launch new colleges, such as the University of Austin, and even newer ones that no one has dreamed up yet. Musk University? Thiel Technical College?\n\n\nA New Kind of Public College What about the American Academy? Experts laughed when Trump proposed launching a new, federally backed college. But former President George Washington wanted one. … At absolute minimum, the American Academy could offer a two-year, high-quality core curriculum, and sympathetic states could mandate their flagship universities accept transfer credit. The Universities of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the like could hoover up students who might otherwise have spent far bigger bucks on a private university with a similar prestige level.\n\n\nThese are just some ideas, and they’re just mine. And, of course, there’s far more the next Trump Education Department should and can do — it just wouldn’t be prudent to broadcast those ideas ahead of time, lest universities take defensive measures.\n\n\nTrump Administration Wants to Install Federal Oversight of Columbia University - The Wall Street Journal. (Thanks KB)\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-consent-decree-trump-federal-funding-2f4c4690?st=nRCE68\n\nA consent decree would be a major escalation of how the federal government normally resolves education-related civil-rights issues. Typically after federal lawyers investigate and find evidence that civil rights were violated, schools enter voluntary agreements to change their practices. The federal government has little ability to enforce such agreements. The Biden administration entered into such voluntary agreements over antisemitism concerns with Brown University and Rutgers.\n\n\nColumbia could fight the move in court; the Justice Department would need to prove that the arrangement is warranted. But a court case could take years, and Columbia would likely lose federal funding in the interim—and might ultimately lose. Opposing the move would also open the school up to required depositions and legal fact-finding, which could keep the school’s campus politics in the spotlight.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: A Playbook for Standing Up to President Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/opinion/trump-law-firms-universities.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThese institutions do not have to capitulate to Mr. Trump. They have a realistic path to defeating his intimidation.\n\n\nYes, Mr. Trump has adopted a more extreme approach to executive power in his second term. He has won some early policy victories, and he will win more. Nonetheless, he faces real constraints on his power. Indeed, the most likely path to American autocracy depends on not only a power-hungry president but also the voluntary capitulation of a cowed civil society. It depends on the mistaken belief that a president is invincible. Anybody who has dealt with a schoolyard bully should recognize this principle: The illusion of invincibility is often his greatest asset.\n\n\nNYTimes: Obama Calls for Universities to Stand Up for Core Values\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/us/politics/obama-trump-college-speech.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, in a campus speech on Thursday, urged universities to resist attacks from the federal government that violate their academic freedom.\n\n\nHe also said schools and students should engage in self-reflection about speech environments on their campuses.\n\n\nEisgruber signals that Princeton will not make concessions (Thanks KB)\n\nhttps://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/04/princeton-news-adpol-eisgruber-university-concessions-bloomberg-interview\n\n“We would look at ways to potentially reallocate endowment funding, which would involve very difficult choices, but at the end of the day, what would happen here and elsewhere is that less research would get done, and that would be a bad thing,” he said.\n\n\nEisgruber also emphasized the need for universities to act together in response to governmental funding cuts.\n\n\n“I think it’s important for universities to stand shoulder to shoulder as we go forward,” he said.\n\nSee also this podcast\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-university-president-willing-to-fight-trump/id1200361736?i=1000702847509\n(which was shared by MOO to the mailing list)\n\nNYTimes: New York Warns Trump It Will Not Comply With Public School D.E.I.

He has mobilized dozens of professors from across the country to track on his website criticalrace.org hundreds of social-justice statements, staff diversity trainings, and courses he says indoctrinate students with false ideas about American racism. His site has been cited more than 170 times by mainstream-media outlets.\n\n\nThe Legal Insurrection Foundation, Jacobson’s nonprofit, collected $1.2 million in revenue from donations and grants in 2023, according to tax filings. It’s not clear who has donated to his cause.\n\n\nThis past December, Jacobson filed a complaint to OCR against the University of Rhode Island for offering more than 31 scholarships exclusively given to minority students. Mentioned in the complaint was the Miya Brophy-Baermann scholarship, which provides $1,500 to speech-language-pathology students who are racial minorities, men, or the first in their families to attend college.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: America’s Brightest Minds Will Walk Away\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/opinion/young-american-scientists.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMany young researchers say they are having to choose between staying in the United States and staying in science.

But on this one point, Donald Trump wants no ambiguity: “My promise to Jewish Americans is this,” he said on the campaign trail. “With your vote, I will be your defender, your protector, and I will be the best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.”\n\n\nAs the first Jewish president of a formerly Methodist university, I find no comfort in the Trump administration’s embrace of my people, on college campuses or elsewhere. Jew hatred is real, but today’s anti-antisemitism isn’t a legitimate effort to fight it.

It awards grants that fund research fellowships, programs at museums and historic sites, website development and documentary filmmaking, among a host of other projects related to the public humanities. But it also disburses a great chunk of its appropriation — some $65 million of an annual budget of roughly $210 million — directly to nonprofit humanities councils in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and five territories.\n\n\nStaff cuts begin at NEH, threatening humanities programs across U.S.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/art/2025/04/10/neh-staff-cuts-reduction-in-force/\n\nTrump Presents Harvard With an Ultimatum for Federal Funds\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/04/trump-sets-demands-harvard-must-meet-regain-federal\n\nThe ultimatum came just three days after the president’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism notified the university it had been placed under review for its alleged failure to protect Jewish students and faculty from discrimination. If the case follows the precedent set at other universities, Harvard and its affiliate medical institutions could lose up to $9 billion in federal grants and contracts if they do not comply.\n\n\nSources say the move is driven less by true concern about antisemitism on campus than by the government’s desire to abolish diversity efforts and hobble higher ed institutions it deems too “woke.” This week alone, the administration has retracted funds from Brown and Princeton Universities.

According to Science, the NIH froze Columbia’s funding Monday at the direction of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH is reportedly not only blocking new funding but also ceasing payments for work on existing projects. In addition, the agency will require prior approval to tap existing disbursements.",

It has to be enforced. Fights for equality have been messy, and quite bloody at times. Understanding that history is important so as not to repeat it. Still, shortly before leaving office in 2020, Mr. Trump established the President’s Advisory 1776 Commission, in part a rebuttal to the 1619 Project, as a way for the administration to write its own version of American history.\n\n\nThe president’s vision to take a sledgehammer to the Department of Education’s ability to function will cause student suffering. The founders believed that education was critical to the full experience of citizenship; it was where students learned arts, sciences, humanities and how to engage with one another. But putting that vision into place left the nation with a system where inequities — in content and classroom composition — were left in place.\n\n\nAmerica began to undo those inequities, and the department protected that progress. Now, less than three months into Mr. Trump’s second presidency, the administration has done everything in its power, and some things beyond its authority, to ensure we are equal no more.",

The officers carried at least one student off the lawn, according to video posted on social media and student interviews.\n\n\nHow conservatives are using Columbia as a ‘test case’ to enforce Trump’s agenda\n\nhttps://wapo.st/43EUxWX\nThis is an important analysis of the playbook being employed and it references what appears to be another Chris Rufo type.\n\nCritical of college admissions, diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and campus protests that he lambasted as pro-Hamas, Max Eden, then a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote an outline that presaged what was to come in the new Trump administration. He singled out Columbia as the top target.\n\n\n “To scare universities straight,” Eden wrote in the Washington Examiner [https://www.aei.org/op-eds/a-comprehensive-guide-to-overhauling-higher-education/] , Education Secretary Linda McMahon “should start by taking a prize scalp. She should simply destroy Columbia University.”\n\n\nOn the day the administration canceled the federal funding to the school, a senior Trump administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, described Columbia as a “test case” for using funding to pressure colleges to comply with Trump’s ideology.\n\n\n“We’re going to bankrupt these universities,” Leo Terrell, leader of the recently formed Justice Department task force on antisemitism, said on Fox News after the cuts to Columbia were announced.\n\n\n“They are targeting private institutions of education and attempting to police and control speech, political expression and thought. And that is truly unprecedented,” said Orion Danjuma, counsel at Protect Democracy, which is representing the unions alongside the law firm Altshuler Berzon. “Columbia is the testing ground for this. It’s a canary in the coal mine.”\n\n\nOther changes are not an exact match to the administration’s demands. The university is not abolishing its judicial board that oversees disciplinary cases as requested. But it will remove students from participating and give the provost oversight. It is not putting the Middle East, South Asian and African Studies department in academic receivership for five years as the administration wanted. That academic department will undergo a review by the provost’s office.\n\n\n“This was planned,” said Reinhold Martin, president of Columbia’s chapter of the AAUP. “We’ve seen the script. The assault on Columbia is going according to that script.”\n\nAs for the Eden piece here are his talking points:\n\nCutting Off Federal Funding – Columbia was, perhaps, the worst offender in indulging the pro-Hamas campus radicals. The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights should initiate a compliance review of every single decision Columbia made. To do that, OCR would need the identities of every single foreign student who supported the protests, actions the Trump administration could deem material support of a terrorist organization. Border czar Tom Homan could then revoke every single one of the foreign protesting students’ visas. If Columbia doesn’t cooperate, McMahon could cut off its research grant funding.\n\n\nRemoving Foreign Money from Higher Education – And while the Trump administration is looking into Columbia, the Justice Department should thoroughly explore indicting former Columbia President Lee Bollinger for fraud if he, through commission or omission, played a role in Columbia’s submission of inaccurate data to US News and World Report. Bollinger submitted the data to boost Columbia’s rank in the report. Once the true data were reported, Columbia’s rank fell from second to 18th. College presidents regard Bollinger as perhaps the greatest college leader of the 21st century. He should be regarded as the worst. Perhaps the college presidents could learn a valuable lesson from the sight of him in an orange jumpsuit.\n\n\nThe second target should be the University of California, Los Angeles. UCLA’s …\n\n\nEnforcing Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard; he first step should be forcing Harvard University to comply. Right after the decision was issued, Harvard all but publicly vowed to do everything in its power to violate the spirit of the Supreme Court’s ruling and the 14th Amendment on which it was based. McMahon should initiate a never-ending compliance review to ensure that Harvard follows the law. … If OCR finds a shred of evidence of racial discrimination, Harvard should lose its Title IV funds. I\n\n\nAnd so many other universities have essentially forfeited the privilege of picking their own professors.\n\n\nThe University of Washington and UIC should be forced to pay back wages to every single white applicant they declined to hire over a DEI statement and hire as many as would still like to work there. … However, it could demand all documents and correspondence on hiring in every university faculty department that implemented DEI statements. It could then train an artificial intelligence model to sort through the records and flag likely discrimination. Trump staffers could then send internal, FOIA-able correspondence regarding hot spots of likely discrimination. … Enterprising trial attorneys could team up with starving adjunct professors, and universities could be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement fees. That would teach them a painful lesson: Hiring based on race rather than academic merit comes at a very high cost.\n\n\nHow Trump can Destroy DEI on Campus – it’s all stereotyping. DEI violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment when stereotyping is institutionalized and promoted in an educational institution receiving federal funding — or so the Trump administration should hold and enforce. … To assure compliance with the 14th Amendment, McMahon could task accreditors with ensuring that students aren’t forced to take DEI-infused courses to graduate. This would, essentially, take Florida’s policy of removing DEI from general education requirements national. When students aren’t forced to take these courses, far fewer will, and the radical Marxists will lose students and influence. … McMahon could also champion college students’ First Amendment rights by forcing colleges to dismantle their so-called “Bias Reporting Systems.” More than half of colleges encourage students to snitch on each other for saying something “biased,” and students suspected of wrong speak are then hauled in front of a campus tribunal of DEI administrators.\n\n\nShaking Up College Accreditation – Trump suggested he would simply fire all the existing accreditors. That could prove prohibitively difficult. But Trump could easily decimate the worst of them: the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. … Trump could also easily expedite the approval of additional accreditors. These accreditors could provide a much more streamlined, cost-effective, outcomes-oriented paradigm than the existing set. They could also specialize in helping to launch new colleges, such as the University of Austin, and even newer ones that no one has dreamed up yet. Musk University? Thiel Technical College?\n\n\nA New Kind of Public College What about the American Academy? Experts laughed when Trump proposed launching a new, federally backed college. But former President George Washington wanted one. … At absolute minimum, the American Academy could offer a two-year, high-quality core curriculum, and sympathetic states could mandate their flagship universities accept transfer credit. The Universities of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the like could hoover up students who might otherwise have spent far bigger bucks on a private university with a similar prestige level.\n\n\nThese are just some ideas, and they’re just mine. And, of course, there’s far more the next Trump Education Department should and can do — it just wouldn’t be prudent to broadcast those ideas ahead of time, lest universities take defensive measures.\n\n\nTrump Administration Wants to Install Federal Oversight of Columbia University - The Wall Street Journal. (Thanks KB)\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/columbia-consent-decree-trump-federal-funding-2f4c4690?st=nRCE68\n\nA consent decree would be a major escalation of how the federal government normally resolves education-related civil-rights issues. Typically after federal lawyers investigate and find evidence that civil rights were violated, schools enter voluntary agreements to change their practices. The federal government has little ability to enforce such agreements. The Biden administration entered into such voluntary agreements over antisemitism concerns with Brown University and Rutgers.\n\n\nColumbia could fight the move in court; the Justice Department would need to prove that the arrangement is warranted. But a court case could take years, and Columbia would likely lose federal funding in the interim—and might ultimately lose. Opposing the move would also open the school up to required depositions and legal fact-finding, which could keep the school’s campus politics in the spotlight.",

So, you can say that, in terms of the loss of freedom, most people feel unaffected. But what we need to get our fellow citizens to see is that it’s all connected, and that when due process is undermined even for a noncitizen, ultimately it can put everyone’s freedom in jeopardy. What lessons do you draw from other countries such as Hungary, India, Poland, Brazil, the Philippines, Turkey and Venezuela, all of which have seen democratic backsliding over the past few decades?\n\n\n The lessons are that people should unify and coordinate as quickly as possible. The more that institutions under threat try to just go their own way or duck for cover, the more they’ll be divided and picked off one by one. The sooner that people rally in coordination and in principled defense of the Constitution and the rule of law, the better the prospect that they will be able to contain and reverse the authoritarian project.\n\n\nNYTimes: What Happened When Trump Altered the Deal With Law Firms and Universities\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/europe/what-happened-when-trump-altered-the-deal-with-law-firms-and-universities.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(In short, the prisoner’s dilemma doesn’t apply when negotiating with the mafia.)\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Battles Academia, but Especially the Ivy League\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/us/politics/trump-ivy-league.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nTimothy L. O’Brien, a biographer of Mr. Trump, said the president’s ire about the upper echelon of academia was not surprising. “He has a long track record of criticizing elites that he desperately wants to be accepted by,” Mr. O’Brien said. As far as the Ivy League, he said, “he could barely wait to get in himself.”\n\n(Not sure this is why; I personally believe things are related to a desire to control competing power bases.)\n\n\n\nPresident Trump fires Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden | AP News\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-library-of-congress-carla-hayden-20a1862ce6d2e0d51a84a37b264ce2ef\n\nNYTimes: Trump Declares High-Speed Internet Program ‘Racist’ and ‘Unconstitutional’\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/politics/trump-biden-digital-equity-act.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas lawmakers moving to greatly increase control of state universities\n\nhttps://wapo.st/4d48IaK\n\nConservative lawmakers, who control all levers of government, are advancing a measure they say would hold institutions more accountable and ensure curriculum is “free from ideological bias.” Faculty could be removed or face civil penalties for violations. Schools that fail to comply could be barred from spending state funds.\n\n\nOpponents say the result would essentially be a takeover of the state’s 126 public universities, community college districts and medical schools, with state officials even allowed to overturn hiring decisions. They fear it could damage the institutions’ reputations and lead to a faculty brain drain.\n\n\nHis (Brandon Creighton) new proposal aims to decrease the power of faculty senates, requiring that half of their members be appointed by school presidents. All would be term-limited, advisory only and removable by top administrators for “political advocacy.”\n\n\nAnother provision would give the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board — composed of nine gubernatorial appointees — the ultimate say in faculty and academic screening. The board would pay special attention to schools’ required core curriculum, to ensure they “do not require or attempt to require a student to adopt a belief that any race, sex, or ethnicity or social, political, or religious belief is inherently superior.”\n\n\nComplaints lodged against professors would be investigated by a new state ombudsman and the attorney general, currently Ken Paxton (R), an ultraconservative Trump ally.\n\n\n“Texas is as broad-reaching a legislative endeavor as we’ve seen,” he (Professor Peter Lake, Stetson University) said. And combined with Trump’s attacks on higher education, the legislation is likely to “embolden red states to experiment with even more control over institutional autonomy, right down to curriculum, hiring and firing, tenure, curriculum review.”\n\n\nUT System Chancellor James B. Milliken also is departing after seven years to become president of the University of California.\n\n\nNew State Laws Target DEI, Struggling Academic Programs, and Tenure\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/new-state-laws-target-dei-struggling-academic-programs-and-tenure\n\n“It fits into a picture with many, many aspects of attempts to control higher education and intellectual and academic freedom,” said Risa Lieberwitz, a professor of labor and employment law at Cornell University and a member of the American Association of University Professors’ committee on academic freedom and tenure.\n\nStates mentioned: Arkansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Wyoming, Kentucky, North Dakota, and Utah.

The measure, known as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, broke a decades-long impasse between congressional Republicans and Democrats on addressing gun violence by focusing largely on improving mental health support for students.\n\n\nTRIO on the Chopping Block\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/retention/2025/05/07/how-trumps-proposed-trio-cuts-could-hamper-college-access\n\nThe Trump administration wants to eliminate the federally funded student support program. That could be devastating for low-income students and the institutions that serve them.\n\n\nHe [sample impacted student] credits his success at Bemidji to TRIO, a federally funded initiative dating back to the 1960s that supports low-income, first-generation college students and students with disabilities as they navigate academic life—and that currently faces an existential threat from the Trump administration.\n\n\n“Today, the pendulum has swung and access to college is not the obstacle it was for students of limited means,” officials wrote in the proposal [Trump budget opening salvo]. “A renewed focus on academics and scholastic accomplishment by [institutions], rather than engaging in woke ideology with federal taxpayer subsidies, would be a welcome change.”\n\n\n\n\nACE’s summary of “STUDENT SUCCESS AND TAXPAYER SAVINGS PLAN” that moves to the House Budget Committee (thanks CMR)\n\nhttps://www.acenet.edu/Documents/Summary-Student-Success-Taxpayer-Savings-Plan.pdf\n(Yes, the name shows the crazy stretching of the all-too elastic phrase “student success”)\nIt includes: Pell Grant restrictions; Loan program eliminations; New repayment plan; Risk-sharing requirement; Regulatory constraints.\nKey parts for Pell\n\nChanges full-time status from 24 semester hours or 36 quarter credit hours to 30 semester hours or 45 quarter credit hours;\n\n(From 12 to 15 credits for CUNY making full time much more out of reach for many of our students)\n\nRequiring that a student who applies for federal student aid be a citizen or a national of the United States or be an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act; and\n\n\nThese provisions would take effect on July 1, 2025, and apply to the 2025-2026 academic year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Trump’s Proposed Budget Cuts Mean for Education, Research (aims to cut at least $163 billion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/05/02/trump-proposes-deep-cuts-education-and-research\n(I’d argue even phrasing this as a planned cut, rather than merely an assault is a mistake, but….)\n\nThe proposed budget plan slashes nearly $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health, $12 billion from the Education Department and nearly $5 billion from the National Science Foundation. The skinny budget also eliminates funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, AmeriCorps, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has already made deep cuts at those agencies and put most—if not all—of their employees on leave.\n\n\nTo compensate for the cuts to programs that directly support students or institutions, the administration argued colleges, states and local communities should on take that responsibility. Other justifications for the cuts reflect the administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and higher ed.\n\n(Again, “crackdown” is far too fair a term here.)\n\nAdditionally, the administration wants to cut the Office for Civil Rights’ budget by $49 million, or 35 percent. The budget document says this cut will refocus OCR “away from DEI and Title IX transgender cases.” In recent years, the Biden administration pleaded with Congress to boost OCR’s funding in order to address an increasing number of complaints. The office received 22,687 complaints in fiscal year 2024, and the Biden administration projected that number to grow to nearly 24,000 in 2025.\n\n\n“The budget cuts funding for: climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and programs in low priority areas of science,” the officials wrote in budget documents. “NSF has fueled research with dubious public value, like speculative impacts from extreme climate scenarios and niche social studies.”\n\n(There is too much there to even unpack; I’ll just note that this was preceded by “we must change course and reorient taxpayer dollars toward proven programs that generate results for American students.”)\n\nThe plan would consolidate NIH programs into five areas: the National Institute on Body Systems Research, the National Institute on Neuroscience and Brain Research, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Institute of Disability Related Research, and the National Institute on Behavioral Health.\n\n\n“The administration is committed to restoring accountability, public trust, and transparency at the NIH,” officials wrote. “NIH has broken the trust of the American people with wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.”\n\n(More nonsense in this “skinny budget”)\n\n\n\n\nUnder Trump, National Science Foundation Cuts Off All Funding to Scientists | Scientific American\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01396-2\n(Only until further notice, as if law breakers mean what they write)\n\nThe policy prevents the NSF, one of the world’s biggest supporters of basic research, from awarding new research grants and from supplying allotted funds for existing grants, such as those that receive yearly increments of money.

According to sources who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, staff were told today that the agency’s 37 divisions—across all eight NSF directorates—are being abolished and the number of programs within those divisions will be drastically reduced. The current directors and deputy directors will lose their titles and might be reassigned to other positions at the agency or elsewhere in the federal government.\n\n\nThe consolidation appears to be driven in part by President Donald Trump’s proposal to cut the agency’s $9 billion budget by 55% for the 2026 fiscal year that begins on 1 October.\n\n\nThe agency is also expected to issue another round of notices tomorrow terminating grants that have already been awarded, sources say. In the past 3 weeks, the agency has pulled the plug on almost 1400 grants worth more than $1 billion.\n\n(CSI faculty were among these who lost funding this week.)\n\n\n\n\nLawsuit Against Humanities Endowment Offers Details on DOGE - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/arts/humanities-endowment-doge-grants.html\n\nEmployees from the Department of Government Efficiency started visiting the office soon after, according to the lawsuit. Citing accounts by former or current staff members at the endowment, the lawsuit says that two DOGE employees, Nate Cavanaugh and Justin Fox, asked for a list of all current grants and then “indiscriminately terminated the vast majority” on April 2. Nearly 1,500 grant recipients received cancellation letters that suggested their projects were not in keeping with “the president’s agenda.”\n\n\nThree weeks later, the agency announced it would be redirecting [stealing ed.] $17 million of its funding to create the National Garden of American Heroes,\n\n\nThe lawsuit contends that those moves violate the Constitution, which reserves the power of the purse for Congress, and also the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\nTrump proposes eliminating the NEA and NEH as arts grants are canceled\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/05/03/trump-budget-nea-neh-eliminate/\n(This applies going forward, the lawsuit applies to past allocations.

The complaint is online here. The suit is likely to proceed quickly, and we will keep you apprised of its progress.\n\n\n\n\nA court decision handed down earlier this week compels the government to restore terminated IMLS funding. I am hopeful that this success will serve as a strong precedent for other suits.\n\n\n\n\nThose who have lost NEH funding should have filed an appeal by now, either as an individual or through their host institution. If you have not done so, the guidance we’ve received is that you should file anyway before taking any further action, following whatever guidelines you have received (and with the understanding that there is, in fact, no truly clear guidance about what is happening at NEH). More information on the appeals process can be found here. When appealing any grant termination, be sure to emphasize how this loss may impact not only your research but your reputation, opportunities passed up to take on the grant-funded project, and the loss of future opportunities that the grant might have made possible. Please remember that our colleagues at NEH – those who remain – are devastated by the current situation and are themselves overwhelmed. They are committed Federal employees who are not to blame for these terminations.

Now, investigating discrimination in schools is practically “impossible.”\n\n\nIn South Dakota, the OCR abruptly terminated its work with a school district that had agreed to take steps to end discrimination against its Native American students. The same office that helped craft the agreement to treat indigenous students equally made a stunning about-face and decided in March that helping Native American students would discriminate against white students.\n\n\nOne OCR attorney, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, told ProPublica that their caseload went from 60 to 380 as they absorbed cases previously handled by employees who worked in offices that had been closed.\n\n\n“OCR is the most useless it’s ever been, and it’s the most dangerous it’s ever been. And by useless, I mean unavailable. Unable to do the work,”\n\n\nInvestigating cases that allege racism, discrimination based on sexual orientation or mistreatment of students with disabilities now requires permission from Trump appointees, according to a memo from OCR leadership. As a result, thousands of discrimination investigations are idled, even ones that were nearing a resolution when Trump took office again.\n\n\nInvestigations being publicized now have largely bypassed the agency’s civil rights attorneys, according to Education Department employees. McMahon and OCR head Craig Trainor created what amounts to a shadow division.\n\n(This article is really a gut punch, but well worth reading)\n\nEducation Dept.

So too must be the student body, staff and leadership. A failing grade, the letter warned, would result in corrective measures, including the deliberate recruiting of “a critical mass” of new faculty and students to correct the imbalance.\n\n\nHarvard has rejected the Trump administration’s demands, calling them a threat to academic freedom and the political independence of higher education. But in a letter to Harvard affiliates informing them that the university was suing the government, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, echoed that vocabulary.\n\n\n“We acknowledge that we have unfinished business,” Dr. Garber wrote. “We need to ensure that the university lives up to its steps to reaffirm a culture of free inquiry, viewpoint diversity and academic exploration.”\n\n\nHarvard itself has been a hotbed of diverse views about the value of viewpoint diversity and its relationship to the bedrock value of academic freedom. But there’s broad agreement that the Trump administration is weaponizing the term — which its letter never defines — in a dangerous way.\n\n\nThe term viewpoint diversity began gaining currency across academia largely through the efforts of Heterodox Academy, a nonpartisan national group founded in 2015 to combat what it describes as “the rise of closed-minded orthodoxies within scholarly communities.”\n\n\nIn recent years, it has been picked up by Republican politicians, as a new tool to support their longstanding argument that universities have been taken over by the left.\n\n\nA report last October by the free expression group PEN America said that viewpoint diversity, while a laudable goal, has too often served as “camouflage” for the real purpose: stifling faculty members’ speech.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Disqualifies Harvard From Future Research Grants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/trump-harvard-research-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThe letter is as they say meshuga\nhttps://x.com/EDSecMcMahon/status/1919517481313427594\nMy favorite is to now blame it on the math\n\nWhy is it, we ask, that Harvard has to teach simple and basic mathematics, when it is supposedly so hard to get into this “acclaimed university”?

And in other circumstances, I would have been like, holy cow. But given what the administration has done over the past three and a half months, it’s not clear to me that it changes the administration’s posture.”\n\n\nTrump administration calls for a freeze on all new grants to Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/05/harvard-new-grants-freeze-trump/\n\nMcMahon’s letter displays an astonishing and frankly disqualifying level of ignorance — about Harvard, about how federal research funding works, and about the plain text of the U.S. Constitution,” Weld (AAUP President of Harvard chapter) said. “The entire higher ed sector must reject this crude authoritarianism with one voice.”\n\n\nTed Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, said, “I think we should all be looking at the interchange between the department, Harvard and the White House as harbingers of things to come.” \n\n\nLarry Summers, former president of Harvard, said the Trump administration’s fight with the Ivy League university has larger implications for civil society. “This is about whether the government has the power to coerce private institutions, using all the various authorities it has to advance particular political agendas of the president,” he said. “But for higher education, this is about academic freedom, which for the better part of a century, the Supreme Court recognized as intimately connected to the First Amendment. So in a broad civic sense, it’s about our commitment to constitutional democracy as manifest in the First Amendment.”\n\n\nTrump Finally Drops the Anti-Semitism Pretext – The latest letter to Harvard makes clear that the administration’s goal is to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal.

But the most notable thing about it is what it leaves out.\n\n\nTo hear McMahon tell it, Harvard is a university on the verge of ruin. (I say McMahon because her signature is at the bottom of the letter, but portions of the document are written in such a distinctive idiolect—“Why is there so much HATE?” the letter asks; it signs off with “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”—that one detects the spirit of a certain uncredited co-author.)\n\n\nWhat you will not find in the McMahon letter is any mention of the original justification for the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on elite universities: anti-Semitism.\n\n\nNow, however, the mask is off. Aside from one oblique reference to congressional hearings about anti-Semitism (“the great work of Congresswoman Elise Stefanik”), the letter is silent on the subject. The administration is no longer pretending that it is standing up for Jewish students. The project has been revealed for what it is: an effort to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal.\n\n\n“There’s no ‘We don’t like you’ authority in the federal Constitution or in statutory law.

Even if Harvard’s legal case is successful, these officials say, the school will still face enormous troubles that may force the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university to rethink its identity and scale.\n\nSo says\n\nThey spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss school officials’ private deliberations.\n\n\nThe crosscurrents are unlike any that the university has faced in its modern history. For centuries, Harvard has cherished its independence, its swaggering pride and its record of academic excellence. But Mr. Trump has reveled in unleashing chaos that many believe will be difficult to contain as long as he sees the university as a target.\n\n\nThe corporation [the board that oversees the university] has told the school’s lawyers not to engage with the Trump administration, according to the two people involved in discussions.\n\n\nComplicating matters is whether the White House will honor a deal.\n\n\nLawrence H. Summers, a former Harvard president, said … “It would be a tragedy if Harvard resolved this in a way that gave support and encouragement to the idea of extralegal extortion.”\n\n\nThe Trump administration this week reiterated its aim to inflict as much damage as possible, when Ms. McMahon fired off a letter telling Harvard that it would not receive future federal grants. Although experts on government contracts and grants scoffed at the missive, the government can essentially blacklist contractors through a process called debarment.\n\n\nAside from the research funding, there will be nothing to stop the administration from saddling the school with more onerous and potentially costly investigations, like the ones currently being conducted by at least five different departments and agencies, including the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Orders to Investigate Columbia Protesters Raised Alarms in Justice Dept.

I did so because the letter represents an authoritarian threat to science, and I knew it wasn’t an isolated, bizarre incident. It is a warning sign, another move in a broader campaign to exert control over research, medicine and media.\n\n\nThe letter asserts that “publications like CHEST Journal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates.” It was written by recently appointed acting U.S. attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr., who gives no examples that might demonstrate partisanship; nor does he cite any laws or legal principles to indicate a matter that should concern the U.S. government.\n\n\nSince I publicly shared this, at least four additional journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, have confirmed receipt of similar letters, according to MedPage Today, STAT News, the New York Times and Science. Aside from Eric Rubin at the NEJM, none of the targeted editors have been willing to go on record, fearing retribution from the Trump administration.\n\n\nWhy CHEST? It’s a specialty outlet—not even among the top 50 medical journals. Is this a keyword-driven campaign like those we’ve seen at the CDC and NIH? Under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., terms like “diversity,” “minority” and “equity” have been systematically flagged.\n\n\nKennedy frequently makes evidence-free claims on podcasts and television shows and now in government press conferences, regardless of the consequences. However, peer-reviewed journals like CHEST require extensive scrutiny as part of their evaluation process.\n\n\nHow a Decades-Old Diversity Program Became Collateral Damage in Trump’s Anti-DEI Crusade\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-a-decades-old-diversity-program-became-collateral-damage-in-trumps-anti-dei-crusade\n\nThe PhD Project has for three decades encouraged business professionals from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue doctorates in the discipline. For years, its work was seen as uncontroversial; its annual conference introduced midcareer business professionals of color to the academy, offering resources and a support network to those interested in switching jobs. Eventually, some of those prospective students would become professors themselves, helping diversify a traditionally homogenous discipline.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Congress Grills College Presidents With an Old Script and New Threats\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/congress-hearing-college-presidents-haverford.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nUnder Republicans’ Scrutiny, College Presidents Apologize for Their Handling of Campus Antisemitism\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/under-republicans-scrutiny-college-presidents-apologize-for-their-handling-of-campus-antisemitism\n\nA three-hour-long hearing on Wednesday once again gave House Republicans the opportunity to amplify reports of antisemitic social-media posts, events, and confrontations, and to demand that institutions provide information on how they discipline students and faculty members who transgress.\n\n\nBut lawmakers seeking to make a point had material to work with. The three campuses all saw pro-Palestinian protests and alleged incidents of antisemitic harassment following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel.\n\n\nWednesday’s hearing marked yet another expansion of Republicans’ efforts to put higher ed under pressure.

Woodward, which established safeguards to protect colleges from ideological and political interference.\n\n\nThe chairs of the boards of trustees at Clark Atlanta University, Eastern Michigan University and the University of Illinois are among the signatories, as well as the heads of the Middle States and New England Commissions of Higher Education.\n\n\nLawmakers in several states have introduced legislation that seeks to increase board oversight in processes like academic programming and tenure, as well as a governor’s ability to appoint board members.\n\n\nA Looming Crisis for Public Colleges: If the federal government cuts Medicaid spending, state funding for higher ed will evaporate.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-looming-crisis-for-public-colleges\n\nThe House Republicans’ plan for reconciliation includes a cut of about $880 billion over the next decade in health-care and energy spending and $230 billion from agriculture. A budget reduction of this magnitude will require significant reductions to Medicaid and SNAP.\n\n\nThat would directly harm low- and moderate-income Americans across the country, but these costs will also be passed on to states, putting pressure on already-tight budgets. And, as history has shown us time and time again, a state-budget squeeze almost always leads to skyrocketing college costs and lower-quality public education.\n\n\nMost states are required to pass balanced budgets each year. But some programs, like Medicaid, are directly tied to formulas and federal matching dollars. When revenue is tight, especially in tough economic times, states reduce the portion of their total budgets that remain “discretionary” — the portion that is not dictated by formula-derived expenses.  In almost every state, higher education is the largest discretionary-spending category.\n\n\nFor just one example, look to Pennsylvania, where I [Tanya I. Garcia] previously served as deputy secretary and commissioner for postsecondary and higher education. For the 30-year period from financial year 1991 to financial year 2021, Pennsylvania increased Medicaid spending by 227 percent and decreased higher-education spending by 28 percent.\n\n\nWhen state funding for higher education drops, it affects open-access, less-selective colleges the most, since they are more dependent on state appropriations and less able to raise their prices than their peers at elite public and flagship institutions. This is a crucial distinction, as 86 percent of all undergraduate students pursuing a degree in the United States do not attend selective flagships or research universities.\n\n\nMake no mistake: Such massive federal funding cuts would unleash mayhem on state budgets and public colleges starved for resources. Almost 40 states will have finalized their budgets by June 30 of this year. Will we have a raft of states calling special legislative sessions to revise their budgets when all is said and done in the nation’s capital? We still have time to avoid this.\n\n\nNYTimes: I Know Trump’s Plan for Universities. It Transformed My College.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/opinion/trump-universities-woke.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMr. Trump has been watching what’s transpired in Florida. The architect of Project 2025’s education policies has said that Florida is “leading the way” on university overhauls. Already, Mr. Trump has threatened to pull funding from colleges that don’t purge language he considers woke. He’s demanded new oversight of certain regional studies departments. Next he could try to ban, as Florida has, “political or social activism.” He could weaken the protections provided by tenure and faculty unions. I saw this happen on my campus, and I know the toll it took. If the Trump administration has its way, my experience could offer a preview of what’s coming for other universities.\n\n\nSince Mr. DeSantis’s crackdown, I’ve seen my colleagues harassed and investigated for addressing topical issues, even outside the classroom. The climate of fear gives the government precisely the result it wants. Administrators and faculty members alike practice anticipatory obedience to avoid even the appearance of wokeness, stifling the sort of open and civil discussions that lead students to develop their own views.\n\n\nSeveral professors have been subjected to efforts at entrapment. Last year a man posing as a student tried to encourage Muslim faculty members to criticize Mr. DeSantis and Israel. A similar incident happened to me. … That incident shattered my conviction that if I did my job well and followed the rules, I would be safe.\n\n\nTeaching is, above all, the creation of a community in the classroom, a web of trust and curiosity that binds students and instructors in a shared intellectual project. Mistrust, fear and self-censorship make that project impossible.\n\n\nNYTimes: West Point Is Supposed to Educate, Not Indoctrinate\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/opinion/west-point-trump-military.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Very good summary of how academic freedom is taken away overnight)\n\n\n\n\nChronicle of Higher Education\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda\nAlso this one on the “dismantling” of DEI\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-higher-eds-dismantling-of-dei\n\nWe Are Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.wearehighered.org/\n(This was mentioned in the NY Times article on the Rutgers “alliance” resolution and allows people to contribute, https://www.wearehighered.org/contact)\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

So, you can say that, in terms of the loss of freedom, most people feel unaffected. But what we need to get our fellow citizens to see is that it’s all connected, and that when due process is undermined even for a noncitizen, ultimately it can put everyone’s freedom in jeopardy. What lessons do you draw from other countries such as Hungary, India, Poland, Brazil, the Philippines, Turkey and Venezuela, all of which have seen democratic backsliding over the past few decades?\n\n\n The lessons are that people should unify and coordinate as quickly as possible. The more that institutions under threat try to just go their own way or duck for cover, the more they’ll be divided and picked off one by one. The sooner that people rally in coordination and in principled defense of the Constitution and the rule of law, the better the prospect that they will be able to contain and reverse the authoritarian project.\n\n\nNYTimes: What Happened When Trump Altered the Deal With Law Firms and Universities\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/world/europe/what-happened-when-trump-altered-the-deal-with-law-firms-and-universities.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(In short, the prisoner’s dilemma doesn’t apply when negotiating with the mafia.)",

Schools that fail to comply could be barred from spending state funds.\n\n\nOpponents say the result would essentially be a takeover of the state’s 126 public universities, community college districts and medical schools, with state officials even allowed to overturn hiring decisions. They fear it could damage the institutions’ reputations and lead to a faculty brain drain.\n\n\nHis (Brandon Creighton) new proposal aims to decrease the power of faculty senates, requiring that half of their members be appointed by school presidents. All would be term-limited, advisory only and removable by top administrators for “political advocacy.”\n\n\nAnother provision would give the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board — composed of nine gubernatorial appointees — the ultimate say in faculty and academic screening. The board would pay special attention to schools’ required core curriculum, to ensure they “do not require or attempt to require a student to adopt a belief that any race, sex, or ethnicity or social, political, or religious belief is inherently superior.”\n\n\nComplaints lodged against professors would be investigated by a new state ombudsman and the attorney general, currently Ken Paxton (R), an ultraconservative Trump ally.\n\n\n“Texas is as broad-reaching a legislative endeavor as we’ve seen,” he (Professor Peter Lake, Stetson University) said. And combined with Trump’s attacks on higher education, the legislation is likely to “embolden red states to experiment with even more control over institutional autonomy, right down to curriculum, hiring and firing, tenure, curriculum review.”\n\n\nUT System Chancellor James B. Milliken also is departing after seven years to become president of the University of California.\n\n\nNew State Laws Target DEI, Struggling Academic Programs, and Tenure\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/new-state-laws-target-dei-struggling-academic-programs-and-tenure\n\n“It fits into a picture with many, many aspects of attempts to control higher education and intellectual and academic freedom,” said Risa Lieberwitz, a professor of labor and employment law at Cornell University and a member of the American Association of University Professors’ committee on academic freedom and tenure.\n\nStates mentioned: Arkansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Wyoming, Kentucky, North Dakota, and Utah.

Now researchers are crowdsourcing databases of suspended grants to shed light on what’s being lost.\n\n\nTrump Administration Cancels $1 Billion in Grants for Student Mental Health (VAC)\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/trump-mental-health-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Whereas Pope wannabees still can qualify for mental health benefits, presumably)\n\nLawmakers authorized the money in 2022 after a former student opened fire at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, killing 19 children and two teachers and injuring 17 others. The measure, known as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, broke a decades-long impasse between congressional Republicans and Democrats on addressing gun violence by focusing largely on improving mental health support for students.\n\n\nTRIO on the Chopping Block\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/retention/2025/05/07/how-trumps-proposed-trio-cuts-could-hamper-college-access\n\nThe Trump administration wants to eliminate the federally funded student support program. That could be devastating for low-income students and the institutions that serve them.\n\n\nHe [sample impacted student] credits his success at Bemidji to TRIO, a federally funded initiative dating back to the 1960s that supports low-income, first-generation college students and students with disabilities as they navigate academic life—and that currently faces an existential threat from the Trump administration.\n\n\n“Today, the pendulum has swung and access to college is not the obstacle it was for students of limited means,” officials wrote in the proposal [Trump budget opening salvo]. “A renewed focus on academics and scholastic accomplishment by [institutions], rather than engaging in woke ideology with federal taxpayer subsidies, would be a welcome change.”\n\n\n\n\nACE’s summary of “STUDENT SUCCESS AND TAXPAYER SAVINGS PLAN” that moves to the House Budget Committee (thanks CMR)\n\nhttps://www.acenet.edu/Documents/Summary-Student-Success-Taxpayer-Savings-Plan.pdf\n(Yes, the name shows the crazy stretching of the all-too elastic phrase “student success”)\nIt includes: Pell Grant restrictions; Loan program eliminations; New repayment plan; Risk-sharing requirement; Regulatory constraints.\nKey parts for Pell\n\nChanges full-time status from 24 semester hours or 36 quarter credit hours to 30 semester hours or 45 quarter credit hours;\n\n(From 12 to 15 credits for CUNY making full time much more out of reach for many of our students)\n\nRequiring that a student who applies for federal student aid be a citizen or a national of the United States or be an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act; and\n\n\nThese provisions would take effect on July 1, 2025, and apply to the 2025-2026 academic year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Trump’s Proposed Budget Cuts Mean for Education, Research (aims to cut at least $163 billion)\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/05/02/trump-proposes-deep-cuts-education-and-research\n(I’d argue even phrasing this as a planned cut, rather than merely an assault is a mistake, but….)\n\nThe proposed budget plan slashes nearly $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health, $12 billion from the Education Department and nearly $5 billion from the National Science Foundation. The skinny budget also eliminates funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, AmeriCorps, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Trump has already made deep cuts at those agencies and put most—if not all—of their employees on leave.\n\n\nTo compensate for the cuts to programs that directly support students or institutions, the administration argued colleges, states and local communities should on take that responsibility. Other justifications for the cuts reflect the administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and higher ed.\n\n(Again, “crackdown” is far too fair a term here.)\n\nAdditionally, the administration wants to cut the Office for Civil Rights’ budget by $49 million, or 35 percent. The budget document says this cut will refocus OCR “away from DEI and Title IX transgender cases.” In recent years, the Biden administration pleaded with Congress to boost OCR’s funding in order to address an increasing number of complaints. The office received 22,687 complaints in fiscal year 2024, and the Biden administration projected that number to grow to nearly 24,000 in 2025.\n\n\n“The budget cuts funding for: climate; clean energy; woke social, behavioral, and economic sciences; and programs in low priority areas of science,” the officials wrote in budget documents. “NSF has fueled research with dubious public value, like speculative impacts from extreme climate scenarios and niche social studies.”\n\n(There is too much there to even unpack; I’ll just note that this was preceded by “we must change course and reorient taxpayer dollars toward proven programs that generate results for American students.”)\n\nThe plan would consolidate NIH programs into five areas: the National Institute on Body Systems Research, the National Institute on Neuroscience and Brain Research, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the National Institute of Disability Related Research, and the National Institute on Behavioral Health.\n\n\n“The administration is committed to restoring accountability, public trust, and transparency at the NIH,” officials wrote. “NIH has broken the trust of the American people with wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.”\n\n(More nonsense in this “skinny budget”)\n\n\n\n\nUnder Trump, National Science Foundation Cuts Off All Funding to Scientists | Scientific American\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01396-2\n(Only until further notice, as if law breakers mean what they write)\n\nThe policy prevents the NSF, one of the world’s biggest supporters of basic research, from awarding new research grants and from supplying allotted funds for existing grants, such as those that receive yearly increments of money.

According to sources who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, staff were told today that the agency’s 37 divisions—across all eight NSF directorates—are being abolished and the number of programs within those divisions will be drastically reduced. The current directors and deputy directors will lose their titles and might be reassigned to other positions at the agency or elsewhere in the federal government.\n\n\nThe consolidation appears to be driven in part by President Donald Trump’s proposal to cut the agency’s $9 billion budget by 55% for the 2026 fiscal year that begins on 1 October.\n\n\nThe agency is also expected to issue another round of notices tomorrow terminating grants that have already been awarded, sources say. In the past 3 weeks, the agency has pulled the plug on almost 1400 grants worth more than $1 billion.\n\n(CSI faculty were among these who lost funding this week.)\n\n\n\n\nLawsuit Against Humanities Endowment Offers Details on DOGE - The New York Times\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/arts/humanities-endowment-doge-grants.html\n\nEmployees from the Department of Government Efficiency started visiting the office soon after, according to the lawsuit. Citing accounts by former or current staff members at the endowment, the lawsuit says that two DOGE employees, Nate Cavanaugh and Justin Fox, asked for a list of all current grants and then “indiscriminately terminated the vast majority” on April 2. Nearly 1,500 grant recipients received cancellation letters that suggested their projects were not in keeping with “the president’s agenda.”\n\n\nThree weeks later, the agency announced it would be redirecting [stealing ed.] $17 million of its funding to create the National Garden of American Heroes,\n\n\nThe lawsuit contends that those moves violate the Constitution, which reserves the power of the purse for Congress, and also the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\nTrump proposes eliminating the NEA and NEH as arts grants are canceled\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/05/03/trump-budget-nea-neh-eliminate/\n(This applies going forward, the lawsuit applies to past allocations.

The complaint is online here. The suit is likely to proceed quickly, and we will keep you apprised of its progress.\n\n\n\n\nA court decision handed down earlier this week compels the government to restore terminated IMLS funding. I am hopeful that this success will serve as a strong precedent for other suits.\n\n\n\n\nThose who have lost NEH funding should have filed an appeal by now, either as an individual or through their host institution. If you have not done so, the guidance we’ve received is that you should file anyway before taking any further action, following whatever guidelines you have received (and with the understanding that there is, in fact, no truly clear guidance about what is happening at NEH). More information on the appeals process can be found here. When appealing any grant termination, be sure to emphasize how this loss may impact not only your research but your reputation, opportunities passed up to take on the grant-funded project, and the loss of future opportunities that the grant might have made possible. Please remember that our colleagues at NEH – those who remain – are devastated by the current situation and are themselves overwhelmed. They are committed Federal employees who are not to blame for these terminations. I urge you to try to be patient as your appeal (and the lawsuit) move forward.",

Duffy announced Friday that the Department of Transportation eliminated seven “woke university grants,” totaling $54 million.\n\nincluding:\n\nabout $9 million to City College of New York’s Center for Social and Economic Mobility for People and Communities through Transportation,\n\n\nThe department also cut a $6 million grant to New York University to fund research on “e-bikes to low-income travelers in transit deserts”\n\n\nHundreds of recipients of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts also received notice Friday (May 2) that their funding had been withdrawn or terminated, NPR reported.\n\n\nAccording to the email, Trump’s priorities include “projects that elevate the Nation’s HBCUs and Hispanic Serving Institutions, celebrate the 250th anniversary of American independence, foster AI competency, empower houses of worship to serve communities, assist with disaster recovery, foster skilled trade jobs, make America healthy again, support the military and veterans, support Tribal communities, make the District of Columbia safe and beautiful, and support the economic development of Asian American communities.”\n\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts rescinds grants, dazing publishers and theaters\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater/2025/05/04/trump-budget-nea-arts-grants-canceled/\n(dazing: make someone unable to think or react properly; stupefy; bewilder.)\n\nEvery arts director at the NEA exits federal culture agency\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/05/07/nea-staff-departure/\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration will put millions of defaulted student-loan borrowers into collections starting Monday and is threatening to confiscate their wages and federal benefits\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/student-loans-debt-payments-collections-6fd28ed3?st=fgHqWY&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nTrump administration to resume collection on student loans in default : NPR\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2025/04/21/nx-s1-5371723/trump-administration-collections-on-defaulted-student-loans\n\nEducation Department Rolls Back Decades of Civil Rights Progress Under Trump — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/education-department-civil-rights-donald-trump-discrimination\n\nHollowed Out: The administration has closed Education Department civil rights offices and fired workers. Now, investigating discrimination in schools is practically “impossible.”\n\n\nIn South Dakota, the OCR abruptly terminated its work with a school district that had agreed to take steps to end discrimination against its Native American students. The same office that helped craft the agreement to treat indigenous students equally made a stunning about-face and decided in March that helping Native American students would discriminate against white students.\n\n\nOne OCR attorney, who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation, told ProPublica that their caseload went from 60 to 380 as they absorbed cases previously handled by employees who worked in offices that had been closed.\n\n\n“OCR is the most useless it’s ever been, and it’s the most dangerous it’s ever been. And by useless, I mean unavailable. Unable to do the work,”\n\n\nInvestigating cases that allege racism, discrimination based on sexual orientation or mistreatment of students with disabilities now requires permission from Trump appointees, according to a memo from OCR leadership. As a result, thousands of discrimination investigations are idled, even ones that were nearing a resolution when Trump took office again.\n\n\nInvestigations being publicized now have largely bypassed the agency’s civil rights attorneys, according to Education Department employees. McMahon and OCR head Craig Trainor created what amounts to a shadow division.\n\n(This article is really a gut punch, but well worth reading)\n\nEducation Dept. Cancels Fulbright-Hays Applications, at Least for Now\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/study-abroad/2025/05/09/fulbright-hays-grants-canceled-year\n\nThe decision, announced Thursday on the Federal Register, will affect doctoral students and faculty who applied for the Group Projects Abroad, Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad and Faculty Research Abroad programs—all of which focus on expanding American expertise in critical languages and are congressionally mandated.\n\n\nAbout 110 individuals and 22 groups from over 55 institutions benefited from these three programs, according to department data, in fiscal year 2022, the most recent year for which data is available. This year, prior to the cancellation, more than 400 applications had been submitted.",

    "text": "NYTimes: Harvard Signals It Will Resist Trump’s Efforts to Revoke Tax-Exempt Status\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-exempt-status.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nNYTimes: The Jewish Student Who Took On Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/us/shabbos-kestenbaum-harvard-lawsuit-settlement.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nNYTimes: Trump and Harvard Both Want ‘Viewpoint Diversity.’ What Does It Mean?\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/arts/harvard-trump-viewpoint-diversity.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThe Trump Administration expects affirmative action for conservative viewpoints:\n\n“Each department, field or teaching unit must be individually viewpoint diverse,” the letter said. So too must be the student body, staff and leadership. A failing grade, the letter warned, would result in corrective measures, including the deliberate recruiting of “a critical mass” of new faculty and students to correct the imbalance.\n\n\nHarvard has rejected the Trump administration’s demands, calling them a threat to academic freedom and the political independence of higher education. But in a letter to Harvard affiliates informing them that the university was suing the government, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, echoed that vocabulary.\n\n\n“We acknowledge that we have unfinished business,” Dr. Garber wrote. “We need to ensure that the university lives up to its steps to reaffirm a culture of free inquiry, viewpoint diversity and academic exploration.”\n\n\nHarvard itself has been a hotbed of diverse views about the value of viewpoint diversity and its relationship to the bedrock value of academic freedom. But there’s broad agreement that the Trump administration is weaponizing the term — which its letter never defines — in a dangerous way.\n\n\nThe term viewpoint diversity began gaining currency across academia largely through the efforts of Heterodox Academy, a nonpartisan national group founded in 2015 to combat what it describes as “the rise of closed-minded orthodoxies within scholarly communities.”\n\n\nIn recent years, it has been picked up by Republican politicians, as a new tool to support their longstanding argument that universities have been taken over by the left.\n\n\nA report last October by the free expression group PEN America said that viewpoint diversity, while a laudable goal, has too often served as “camouflage” for the real purpose: stifling faculty members’ speech.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Disqualifies Harvard From Future Research Grants\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/us/politics/trump-harvard-research-grants.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\nThe letter is as they say meshuga\nhttps://x.com/EDSecMcMahon/status/1919517481313427594\nMy favorite is to now blame it on the math\n\nWhy is it, we ask, that Harvard has to teach simple and basic mathematics, when it is supposedly so hard to get into this “acclaimed university”? Who is getting in under such a low standard when others, with fabulous grades and a great understanding of the highest levels of mathematics, are being rejected?\n\nWhen the NY Times calls this “a contentious letter” they are only sane washing it. It might better be described by an AI prompt “write crazy letter on Harvard in the voice of the president, include all specious claims”\n\nDeciphering the Trump Administration’s Latest Letter to Harvard\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/05/07/experts-unpack-linda-mcmahons-latest-letter-harvard\nInsidehighered found one Project 2025 voice here:\n\n“When the secretary says, ‘Don’t come to us for grants anymore,’ she means that, and she can enforce it,” said Adam Kissel, a visiting fellow in the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Education Policy. “The tone suggests that Harvard really needs to wake up and understand the dire nature of its situation.”\n\nBut by and large, this is the take they find\n\nBut Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, described Monday’s letter as a “particularly disturbing” and “unwarranted escalation of threats.” What the Trump administration has done since day one, Pasquerella said, is launch a “politically motivated attack, not only against Harvard, but higher education as a whole,” and it’s all part of a long-standing Republican playbook.\n\n\nMultiple Inside Higher Ed sources have described the Trump administration’s approach to higher education as “fascist” or “authoritarian,” and Pasquerella even noted that the White House has positioned Viktor Orbán—Hungary’s right-wing prime minister who has long been known for his assault on academic freedom—as someone to emulate.\n\n\n“The president is so bombastic and so over-the-top that it’s hard for me to see gradations,” Hess [director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank] said. “So, sure, the secretary sending a letter that declared ‘don’t bother applying for anything’ is an extraordinary declaration. And in other circumstances, I would have been like, holy cow. But given what the administration has done over the past three and a half months, it’s not clear to me that it changes the administration’s posture.”\n\n\nTrump administration calls for a freeze on all new grants to Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/05/05/harvard-new-grants-freeze-trump/\n\nMcMahon’s letter displays an astonishing and frankly disqualifying level of ignorance — about Harvard, about how federal research funding works, and about the plain text of the U.S. Constitution,” Weld (AAUP President of Harvard chapter) said. “The entire higher ed sector must reject this crude authoritarianism with one voice.”\n\n\nTed Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, said, “I think we should all be looking at the interchange between the department, Harvard and the White House as harbingers of things to come.” \n\n\nLarry Summers, former president of Harvard, said the Trump administration’s fight with the Ivy League university has larger implications for civil society. “This is about whether the government has the power to coerce private institutions, using all the various authorities it has to advance particular political agendas of the president,” he said. “But for higher education, this is about academic freedom, which for the better part of a century, the Supreme Court recognized as intimately connected to the First Amendment. So in a broad civic sense, it’s about our commitment to constitutional democracy as manifest in the First Amendment.”\n\n\nTrump Finally Drops the Anti-Semitism Pretext – The latest letter to Harvard makes clear that the administration’s goal is to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal. (Thanks BE for the sharing and the gift link!)\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/05/mcmahon-harvard-letter/682717/?gift=yCYg0MdUGpnvquf3En3lpkKQKFBhGvbst4TkhNQ1SSk&utm_source=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=social\n(A critique that doesn’t sanewash and well worth reading)\n\nThe intensely hostile letter that Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent to the leadership of Harvard yesterday has a lot going on. But the most notable thing about it is what it leaves out.\n\n\nTo hear McMahon tell it, Harvard is a university on the verge of ruin. (I say McMahon because her signature is at the bottom of the letter, but portions of the document are written in such a distinctive idiolect—“Why is there so much HATE?” the letter asks; it signs off with “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”—that one detects the spirit of a certain uncredited co-author.)\n\n\nWhat you will not find in the McMahon letter is any mention of the original justification for the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on elite universities: anti-Semitism.\n\n\nNow, however, the mask is off. Aside from one oblique reference to congressional hearings about anti-Semitism (“the great work of Congresswoman Elise Stefanik”), the letter is silent on the subject. The administration is no longer pretending that it is standing up for Jewish students. The project has been revealed for what it is: an effort to punish liberal institutions for the crime of being liberal.\n\n\n“There’s no ‘We don’t like you’ authority in the federal Constitution or in statutory law. In fact, quite the opposite: You’re precluded from that.” [Derek Black, a law professor at the University of South Carolina]\n\n\nHarvard Faculty Pledge 10% of Their Salary to Defend Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/06/harvard-faculty-pledge-10-salary-defend-against-trump\n\nNearly 100 senior faculty members at Harvard have committed to taking a pay cut to support the institution’s legal defense against the federal government.\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Leaders See Only Bad Outcomes Ahead as They Battle Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/us/harvard-trump-court-case-negotiation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nBut behind the scenes, several senior officials at Harvard and on its top governing board believe that the university is confronting a crisis that could last until President Trump is out of power, according to three people involved in the discussions. Even if Harvard’s legal case is successful, these officials say, the school will still face enormous troubles that may force the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university to rethink its identity and scale.\n\nSo says\n\nThey spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to discuss school officials’ private deliberations.\n\n\nThe crosscurrents are unlike any that the university has faced in its modern history. For centuries, Harvard has cherished its independence, its swaggering pride and its record of academic excellence. But Mr. Trump has reveled in unleashing chaos that many believe will be difficult to contain as long as he sees the university as a target.\n\n\nThe corporation [the board that oversees the university] has told the school’s lawyers not to engage with the Trump administration, according to the two people involved in discussions.\n\n\nComplicating matters is whether the White House will honor a deal.\n\n\nLawrence H. Summers, a former Harvard president, said … “It would be a tragedy if Harvard resolved this in a way that gave support and encouragement to the idea of extralegal extortion.”\n\n\nThe Trump administration this week reiterated its aim to inflict as much damage as possible, when Ms. McMahon fired off a letter telling Harvard that it would not receive future federal grants. Although experts on government contracts and grants scoffed at the missive, the government can essentially blacklist contractors through a process called debarment.\n\n\nAside from the research funding, there will be nothing to stop the administration from saddling the school with more onerous and potentially costly investigations, like the ones currently being conducted by at least five different departments and agencies, including the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Orders to Investigate Columbia Protesters Raised Alarms in Justice Dept.

    "text": "The Scary Implications of U.S. Government Attacks on Medical Journals | Scientific American\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-scary-implications-of-u-s-government-attacks-on-medical-journals/\n\nIn April, I decided to make public a leaked letter from the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to the editor-in-chief of CHEST, a leading pulmonology and critical care journal. I did so because the letter represents an authoritarian threat to science, and I knew it wasn’t an isolated, bizarre incident. It is a warning sign, another move in a broader campaign to exert control over research, medicine and media.\n\n\nThe letter asserts that “publications like CHEST Journal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates.” It was written by recently appointed acting U.S. attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr., who gives no examples that might demonstrate partisanship; nor does he cite any laws or legal principles to indicate a matter that should concern the U.S. government.\n\n\nSince I publicly shared this, at least four additional journals, including the New England Journal of Medicine, have confirmed receipt of similar letters, according to MedPage Today, STAT News, the New York Times and Science. Aside from Eric Rubin at the NEJM, none of the targeted editors have been willing to go on record, fearing retribution from the Trump administration.\n\n\nWhy CHEST? It’s a specialty outlet—not even among the top 50 medical journals. Is this a keyword-driven campaign like those we’ve seen at the CDC and NIH? Under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., terms like “diversity,” “minority” and “equity” have been systematically flagged.\n\n\nKennedy frequently makes evidence-free claims on podcasts and television shows and now in government press conferences, regardless of the consequences. However, peer-reviewed journals like CHEST require extensive scrutiny as part of their evaluation process.\n\n\nHow a Decades-Old Diversity Program Became Collateral Damage in Trump’s Anti-DEI Crusade\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/how-a-decades-old-diversity-program-became-collateral-damage-in-trumps-anti-dei-crusade\n\nThe PhD Project has for three decades encouraged business professionals from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue doctorates in the discipline. For years, its work was seen as uncontroversial; its annual conference introduced midcareer business professionals of color to the academy, offering resources and a support network to those interested in switching jobs. Eventually, some of those prospective students would become professors themselves, helping diversify a traditionally homogenous discipline.",

It did remind him of Eastern European “Communist Party minder[s] watching over the untrusted bureaucracy.”\n\n\nHe adds: “It also approaches the compilation of an enemies list.”\n\n\nCal Poly, DePaul and Haverford Head to Capitol Hill\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/governance/executive-leadership/2025/05/07/cal-poly-depaul-and-haverford-head-capitol-hill\n\nThis time, lawmakers are targeting California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo; DePaul University; and Haverford College. Presidents from all three institutions will testify at a congressional hearing today.\n\n\nIn all three letters, the Republican-led Committee on Education and the Workforce cited alleged instances of antisemitism and noted failing grades on the Anti-Defamation League’s Campus Antisemitism Report Card: Both DePaul and Haverford received an F, while Cal Poly earned a D.\n\n(Put aside a committee that conflates a D with failing and perhaps worry that Hunter has a “C” grade and could be up soon by these standards.)\n\nHigher Education Leaders Call for Greater Defense of Board Independence\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/05/07/higher-ed-leaders-call-defense-board-independence\n(Reports on this letter https://agb.org/news/letters-and-testimony/community-letter-reaffirming-the-independence-of-higher-education-governance-a-call-to-action/)\n\nAmerican higher education leaders, advocates and stakeholders must stand together to “defend the autonomy of college and university governing boards as a cornerstone of constitutional freedoms; and reject political interference that undermines academic excellence and fiduciary stewardship,” the group said.\n\n\nThey also called for leaders to reaffirm the principles of institutional autonomy laid out in the 1819 Supreme Court decision Dartmouth College v. Woodward, which established safeguards to protect colleges from ideological and political interference.\n\n\nThe chairs of the boards of trustees at Clark Atlanta University, Eastern Michigan University and the University of Illinois are among the signatories, as well as the heads of the Middle States and New England Commissions of Higher Education.\n\n\nLawmakers in several states have introduced legislation that seeks to increase board oversight in processes like academic programming and tenure, as well as a governor’s ability to appoint board members.\n\n\nA Looming Crisis for Public Colleges: If the federal government cuts Medicaid spending, state funding for higher ed will evaporate.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-looming-crisis-for-public-colleges\n\nThe House Republicans’ plan for reconciliation includes a cut of about $880 billion over the next decade in health-care and energy spending and $230 billion from agriculture. A budget reduction of this magnitude will require significant reductions to Medicaid and SNAP.\n\n\nThat would directly harm low- and moderate-income Americans across the country, but these costs will also be passed on to states, putting pressure on already-tight budgets. And, as history has shown us time and time again, a state-budget squeeze almost always leads to skyrocketing college costs and lower-quality public education.\n\n\nMost states are required to pass balanced budgets each year. But some programs, like Medicaid, are directly tied to formulas and federal matching dollars. When revenue is tight, especially in tough economic times, states reduce the portion of their total budgets that remain “discretionary” — the portion that is not dictated by formula-derived expenses.  In almost every state, higher education is the largest discretionary-spending category.\n\n\nFor just one example, look to Pennsylvania, where I [Tanya I. Garcia] previously served as deputy secretary and commissioner for postsecondary and higher education. For the 30-year period from financial year 1991 to financial year 2021, Pennsylvania increased Medicaid spending by 227 percent and decreased higher-education spending by 28 percent.\n\n\nWhen state funding for higher education drops, it affects open-access, less-selective colleges the most, since they are more dependent on state appropriations and less able to raise their prices than their peers at elite public and flagship institutions. This is a crucial distinction, as 86 percent of all undergraduate students pursuing a degree in the United States do not attend selective flagships or research universities.\n\n\nMake no mistake: Such massive federal funding cuts would unleash mayhem on state budgets and public colleges starved for resources. Almost 40 states will have finalized their budgets by June 30 of this year. Will we have a raft of states calling special legislative sessions to revise their budgets when all is said and done in the nation’s capital? We still have time to avoid this.\n\n\nNYTimes: I Know Trump’s Plan for Universities. It Transformed My College.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/opinion/trump-universities-woke.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nMr. Trump has been watching what’s transpired in Florida. The architect of Project 2025’s education policies has said that Florida is “leading the way” on university overhauls. Already, Mr. Trump has threatened to pull funding from colleges that don’t purge language he considers woke. He’s demanded new oversight of certain regional studies departments. Next he could try to ban, as Florida has, “political or social activism.” He could weaken the protections provided by tenure and faculty unions. I saw this happen on my campus, and I know the toll it took. If the Trump administration has its way, my experience could offer a preview of what’s coming for other universities.\n\n\nSince Mr. DeSantis’s crackdown, I’ve seen my colleagues harassed and investigated for addressing topical issues, even outside the classroom. The climate of fear gives the government precisely the result it wants. Administrators and faculty members alike practice anticipatory obedience to avoid even the appearance of wokeness, stifling the sort of open and civil discussions that lead students to develop their own views.\n\n\nSeveral professors have been subjected to efforts at entrapment. Last year a man posing as a student tried to encourage Muslim faculty members to criticize Mr. DeSantis and Israel. A similar incident happened to me. … That incident shattered my conviction that if I did my job well and followed the rules, I would be safe.\n\n\nTeaching is, above all, the creation of a community in the classroom, a web of trust and curiosity that binds students and instructors in a shared intellectual project. Mistrust, fear and self-censorship make that project impossible.\n\n\nNYTimes: West Point Is Supposed to Educate, Not Indoctrinate\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/opinion/west-point-trump-military.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(Very good summary of how academic freedom is taken away overnight)",

It called for “intrinsic goodness” and recognizing the value of “liberal systems and methods” over “violence and bullying and the suppression of freedom of the press.”\n\n\nBut exactly a century later, a modern group of academics, researchers and writers around the world is giving it another go — fearing that the world is once again sleepwalking into dictatorship and violence.

But Tulane leaders have chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.”\n\n\n“It started with the pro-Palestinian activism on our campus and others across the country. It’s emboldened a lot of political leaders to feel they can make inroads by silencing faculty in other areas,” Michelle Lacey, a math professor and president of Tulane’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, told Inside Higher Ed. “That was the catalyst for creating a climate where university administrators are very nervous, especially now as we see the government pulling funding for areas of research they don’t like.”\n\n\nLast summer, he [Governor Landry, Trump aligned[ enacted a law that allows him to directly appoint board chairs at the state’s public colleges and universities.

The ostensible reason offered is so that State Department officials can conduct additional vetting of visas applicants, by reviewing their social media accounts. According to reports, the cable reads: “Effective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consular sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor (F, M, and J) visa appointment capacity until further guidance is issued [in a separate, forthcoming telegram], which we anticipate in the coming days.”\n\n\nState Dept. restarts student visa interviews with tougher social media rules\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/18/student-visas-social-media-vetting-state-department/\n\nAs staff members examine students’ profiles, the cable instructed, they must look to “identify applicants who bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles; who advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists and other threats to U.S. national security; or who perpetrate unlawful antisemitic harassment or violence.”\n\n\nOne State department official noted that the agency issued 446,000 student visas in 2023. “If everyone has to now have their social media scrubbed for derogatory information? Officers do not have that time.”\n\n\nThe cable suggested that State Department officials should request that applicants make public and accessible all portions of their social media accounts and should penalize them if they refuse.\n\n\nIf portions of accounts remain “set to ‘private’ or otherwise limited, you should treat the case as any other where an applicant fails to provide certain information on request,” the cable stated. It added, in a bolded sentence, “You must consider whether such failure reflects evasiveness or otherwise calls into question the applicant’s credibility.”\n\n(Also)\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/18/social-media-screening-student-visas-00413160\n(Also)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/us/politics/student-visa-applications.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nDOJ Targets In-State Tuition for Noncitizens in Kentucky as Texas Students Fight Back\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/20/after-texas-doj-targets-kentuckys-state-tuition\n\nThe Justice Department sued Kentucky politicians over in-state tuition benefits for undocumented students, just as Texas students and advocates are pushing back against a lawsuit that killed a similar state policy.\n\n\nThe department filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky on Tuesday challenging the in-state tuition policy for undocumented students. The lawsuit, which names Democratic governor Andy Beshear, Commissioner of Education Robbie Fletcher and the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education, takes issue with a policy that allows graduates of Kentucky high schools who live in the state, regardless of citizenship, to access in-state tuition benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Universities Would Overhaul Research Funding\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/18/university-leaders-weigh-changes-research\n\nNow, after just over six weeks of work, that group known as the Joint Associations Group is homing in on a plan to rework how the government funds research, and they want feedback from the university research community before they present a proposal to Congress and the Trump administration at the end of the month.\n\n\n“Unfortunately, something is going to change,” said Barbara Snyder, president of the Association of American Universities. “Either we will be part of it or it will be imposed upon us … Significant division in the research community is going to kill us.”\n\n\nBoth versions of what JAG is calling the Fiscal Accountability in Research model, or FAIR, are geared toward offering more accountability and transparency about how federal research dollars are spent. JAG hopes that in the end, the new model will be simpler than the current one. They also want to nix terms like “indirect costs rate” and “overhead” for either essential research support or general research operations in an effort to underscore that the money goes toward the real costs of research.\n\n\nOne model, which the group calls FAIR No. 1, would include costs related to managing the grant, general research operations and facilities as a fixed percentage of the total budget. The percentage would be based in part on the type of institution and research. This approach is designed to be simple and reasonable, according to the group’s presentation, but it’s more general, which makes it “difficult to account for the wide array of research frameworks that now exist.”\n\n\nThe other model, FAIR No. 2, would more accurately reflect the actual costs of a project and make the structure for federal grants more like those from private foundations. Under this model, essential research support would be lumped into the project costs while funding for general research operations, such as payroll and procurement, would be a fixed percentage of the total budget. That change would likely increase the direct costs of the project.\n\n\nResearch Grants Increasingly Require Compliance With Trump’s Orders. Here’s How Colleges Are Responding.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/research-grants-increasingly-require-compliance-with-trumps-orders-heres-how-colleges-are-responding\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the conditions for accepting federal funding have become increasingly partisan. The Chronicle first reported in May that at least two notice-of-award letters from the National Institutes of Health, which are legal documents spelling out the terms of grants, mandated compliance with Trump’s executive order recognizing only two sexes, effectively excluding transgender people from U.S. policy.\n\n\nNow, according to scientists and colleges contacted by The Chronicle, an increasing number of grant letters — from the NIH and other agencies — require compliance with one or more of Trump’s executive orders and with civil-rights laws, which Trump has sought to reinterpret.\n\n\nIn one striking example of the ever-changing environment, the NIH announced a policy in April that required grantees to attest that they don’t operate “illegal” diversity, equity, and inclusion programs or support boycotts of Israel when accepting federal funds. But over the past week, the policy was abruptly rescinded, then put back in place, then rescinded again without explanation.\n\n\nA federal judge announced a short-term win for scientists on Monday, ruling that Trump’s termination of hundreds of grants because they referenced DEI or LGBTQ issues was discriminatory, and ordering the government to restore the funding.\n\n\nHow Senate Republicans Want to Hold Colleges Accountable\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/06/20/how-senate-republicans-want-hold-colleges-accountable\n\nThe high chamber’s proposal, which ties a university’s access to federal loans to how much their students earn after graduation, is simpler and more productive than the House proposal, known as risk-sharing, which would require colleges to pay an annual penalty based on their students’ outstanding loan balances, they say.\n\n\nThe Senate plan seems to be based on an existing regulation known as gainful employment, which uses students’ earnings and debt to measure whether for-profit and non-degree programs adequately prepare their students for the workforce. But Republicans who sponsored the bill and expanded its reach to all degree programs have been wary of drawing attention to the overlap, as lawmakers have avoided calling it anything like “gainful employment 2.0” or “gainful for all.”\n\n\nRepublicans have historically opposed the Democratic policy, which was first put in place during the Obama administration, saying it unfairly targeted for-profit programs and that a free market would be the best way to regulate the quality of academic programs.\n\n\nCongressional Republicans Want to End Grad PLUS Loans. How Might It Affect Your Campus?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/congressional-republicans-want-to-end-grad-plus-loans-how-might-it-affect-your-campus\n\nCongressional Republicans appear set to effectively shut down the 20-year-old Grad PLUS federal student-loan program as House and Senate lawmakers seek passage of a sprawling set of budget cuts, tax adjustments, and policy changes — bundled together and branded by President Trump as the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n\nwould see the Grad PLUS loan program, which had been expected to lend out roughly $19 billion annually between 2026-34, phased out for new borrowers starting in the 2026-27 academic year. The program would eventually be mothballed for all borrowers starting in the 2029-30 academic year.\n\n(The interactive table has some detail\n\n\n\nCollege\nN\nDisbursement\n\n\n\n\nCCNY\n180\n3.3M\n\n\nGC\n193\n2.6M\n\n\nHunter\n114\n1.7M\n\n\nBaruch\n79\n1.6M\n\n\n\nBrooklyn, John Jay, York, Lehman, Queens, CSI also impacted ~ 2M combined)\n\nBut without access to Grad PLUS financing, said Suzanne Ortega, president of the Council of Graduate Schools, graduate-level education will either become unattainable for some students or “force them into high-cost private debt, exacerbating the student-debt crisis and existing work-force shortages in critical fields like teaching, law enforcement, public-health professions, and engineers.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump is undermining U.S. science. Here’s why that’s dangerous.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/18/trump-science-attacks-internet/\n\nThe evisceration of the National Science Foundation (NSF) — including wholesale firings, budget-slashing and arbitrary elimination of grants — is especially worrisome to those of us who understand the crucial role science has played in making America a great and powerful nation. Congress must act soon to halt this devastating attack.\n\n\nAt its heart was a management ethos borrowed from successful wartime research: the idea that knowledgeable scientists could identify the most fruitful topics and the best ways to pursue them. T\n\n\nIn the past, the NSF has usually enjoyed bipartisan support from both presidents and members of Congress. But the ravages currently being inflicted upon the agency may bring a truly golden era of American science to a halt. The February dismissal of 168 “probationary” NSF employees included career scientists newly arrived from academic positions to work as program managers familiar with the scientific disciplines they were to oversee. Though some have been reinstated by court order, the chilling uncertainty this ill-considered action instills in the NSF workforce and its grantees can seriously harm U.S. science.\n\n\nWhat’s worse, the 2026 fiscal year Trump budget calls for slashing $5 billion from the current $9 billion NSF budget. That would be the death knell of the storied agency as it has been known for decades\n\n\n\n\n\ntracking site\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda#research\n\nThe Scientific Research Lost Amid the Trump Administration’s NIH Cuts — ProPublica\n\nhttps://projects.propublica.org/nih-cuts-research-lost-trump/\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is responsible for more than 80% of the world’s grant investment in biomedical research. Its funding has sparked countless medical breakthroughs — on cancer, diabetes, strokes — and plays a fundamental role in the development of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n\nThe NIH has rarely revoked funding once it has been awarded. Out of the tens of thousands of grants overseen by the institution since 2012, it terminated fewer than five for violations of the agency’s terms and conditions.\n\n\nThen Donald Trump was reelected.\n\n\nSince his January inauguration, his administration has terminated more than 1,450 grants, withholding more than $750 million in funds; officials have said they are curbing wasteful spending and “unscientific” research.\n\n\nThe mass cancellation of grants in response to political policy shifts has no precedent, former and current NIH officials told ProPublica. It threatens the stability of the institution and the scientific enterprise of the nation at large.\n\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the toll, ProPublica reached out to more than 500 researchers, scientists and investigators whose grants were terminated. More than 150 responded to share their experiences, which reveal consequences that experts say run counter to scientific logic and even common sense.\n\n(Well worth reading to gain a sense of scale of this sabotage)\n\nTrump’s NIH Axed Research Grants Despite Court Order — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/trump-nih-cuts-transgender-research-grants\n(And more details on sabotage at the NIH)\n\nNearly two weeks after the court’s preliminary injunction was issued, the National Institutes of Health’s then-acting head, Dr. Matthew J. Memoli, drafted a memo that details how the agency, in response to Trump’s executive orders, cut funding for research grants that “promote or inculcate gender ideology.” An internal spreadsheet of terminated NIH grants also references “gender ideology” and lists the number associated with Trump’s executive order as the reason for the termination of more than a half dozen research grants. [Yet, “Lawyers for the federal government have repeatedly claimed in court filings that the administration has been complying with the order (stopping it from cutting funding related to gender identity and the provision of gender-affirming care in response to President Donald Trump’s executive orders)”]\n\n\nThe Washington attorney general’s allegation that the Trump administration violated a court order comes as the country lurches toward a constitutional crisis amid accusations that the executive branch has defied or ignored court orders in several other cases.\n\n\nin depositions filed in the case last week, two NIH officials testified that DOGE itself gave directions in hundreds of grant terminations.\n\n\nThe lawsuit offers an unprecedented view into the termination of more than 600 grants at the NIH over the past two months. Many of the canceled grants appear to have focused on subjects that the administration claims are unscientific or that the agency should no longer focus on under new priorities, such as gender identity, vaccine hesitancy and diversity, equity and inclusion. Grants related to research in China have also been cut, and climate change projects are under scrutiny.\n\n\nMike Faulk, the deputy communications director for the Washington state attorney general’s office, told ProPublica in an email that the administration “appears to have used DOGE in this instance to keep career NIH officials in the dark about what was happening and why.” “While claiming to be transparent, DOGE has actively hidden its activities and its true motivations,” he said.\n\n\n“Their claim to have complied with the preliminary injunction is almost laughable,” said Faulk, the office’s deputy communications director. “The Trump administration is playing games with no apparent respect for the rule of law.”\n\n\nThe executive order detailing DOGE’s responsibilities describes the cost-cutting team as advisers that consult agency heads on the termination of contracts and grants. No language in the orders gives the DOGE team members the authority to direct the cancellation of grants or contracts. However, the depositions portray Riley [former consultant for McKinsey & Co. and DOGE member] as giving directions on how to conduct the terminations.\n\n\nJeremy Berg, who led the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the NIH from 2003 to 2011, told ProPublica that the administration’s assessment of the institution was “not fair and not based on any substantial analysis or evidence,” and the proposed cuts “would be absolutely devastating to NIH and to biomedical research in the United States.”\n\n\nJudge Rejects Trump’s ‘Appalling’ NIH LGBTQ, Race Grant Cuts\n\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/judge-clashes-with-trump-justice-department-over-nih-grant-cuts\n(Thanks KB)\n\n“This represents racial discrimination and discrimination against America’s LGBTQ community.

A hearing in the case is set for July 2.\n\n\nFor example, Johns Hopkins and the DOD currently have in place a negotiated indirect cost rate of 55 percent. In 2024 JHU received $32 million from the DOD to cover indirect costs, according to the lawsuit. If the DOD’s plan moves forward, however, the university would lose $22 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTennessee Lawsuit Puts HSIs’ Fate on the Line\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/13/tenn-lawsuit-puts-hispanic-servings-fate-line\n\nTwo years after its Supreme Court victory against Harvard and UNC Chapel Hill, Students for Fair Admissions has a new target in its sights: Hispanic-serving institutions.

Now, obscured by the turmoil of the many other challenges to higher education since the start of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, tenure has come under siege in states across the country.\n\n\n“It’s the flip side of the same assault,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, or AFT, which represents 400,000 faculty and other university and college employees. “Some of the assault is coming from taking away grants, and some of the assault is coming by taking away tenure.”\n\n(But it doesn’t seem to be driven by a newly appointed leader)\n\n“To me, it’s about the Senate wanting control over the university,” said Christian Fern, executive director of the University of Hawai‘i Professional Assembly, the faculty union.\n\n(States mentioned: Hawaii, Nebraska, Ohio, Kentucky, Texas, Indiana, Arkansas, North Dakota, Kansas)\n\n“This level of attack couldn’t gain the kind of momentum it has without the declining public support for higher education,” Reuben [Harvard historian] said. “It couldn’t have happened to this magnitude before, because there was a general sense that higher education was good for society.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard Will Ask a Judge to Block Trump From Barring International Students\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/us/harvard-international-students-lawsuit-injunction.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe hearing follows at least four different attempts by Trump administration officials to end or limit Harvard’s foreign enrollment. If they succeed, it could affect about 7,000 international scholars and potentially deliver a disabling blow to the campus’s finances, curriculum and identity.\n\n\nIn their court filing, Harvard’s lawyers argued that broad language was necessary because the government had “committed to continuing — indeed to intensifying — its retaliatory campaign,” one that can “throw Harvard and its international community into turmoil.”\n\n\nThe litigation, which is one of two cases Harvard has filed against the Trump administration, began last month when the Department of Homeland Security said it was revoking Harvard’s ability to host students under a system called the Student Exchange and Visitor Program.\n\n\nA lawyer for Harvard, Ian Gershengorn, accused the administration of resorting to “shenanigans” in its efforts to bar foreign students from Harvard.\n\n\nHarvard has said the actions aren’t grounded in real violations but instead are retaliation for its refusal to bend to the administration’s will.\n\n\nJudge Waits to Rule on Trump’s Effort to Bar Harvard Foreign Students\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/17/judge-delays-ruling-trump-ban-harvard-foreign\n\nIn a hearing on Monday, a federal judge put off making a ruling on whether to continue blocking President Trump’s proclamation banning Harvard international students and researchers from entering the country. The judge, Allison Burroughs of the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, agreed to decide within a week and extended an order to temporarily halt the policy until then.\n\n\nThe hearing came after Harvard swiftly filed a legal challenge to Trump’s directive in early June, a day after it was issued. Burroughs quickly granted a temporary restraining order and is now weighing a longer-lasting injunction.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Negotiation or Capitulation? How Columbia Got Off Trump’s Hot Seat.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/nyregion/columbia-middle-east-studies-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nWhile many in the academic world have accused Columbia of caving to Mr. Trump’s pressure, the university’s strategy — so far — has limited the bleeding, even as Harvard has absorbed cut after cut, stretching into billions of dollars. While opponents of the Trump administration’s crackdown have lauded Harvard for standing its ground, it is far from clear which school will be better off in the long run. And the question remains whether Columbia’s path can offer a road map for other universities attacked by the president.\n\n\nStill, the federal Department of Education threatened Columbia’s accreditation in early June, saying that in its eyes, the school was no longer meeting the standards necessary for the key credential, alleging it had “acted with deliberate indifference” toward the harassment of Jewish students.\n\n\n“There is a basic principle of academic freedom that is under attack, but I still believe in it,” he said. “And I think everybody in this department believes in it. And I think the students we teach believe in it.”\n\n\nFederal Judge Dismisses AAUP Lawsuit Challenging Columbia Grant Freezes\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/17/judge-dismisses-lawsuit-over-columbia-grant-freezes\n\nJudge Mary Kay Vyskocil of the Southern District of New York, however, ruled that the unions had no standing to file the lawsuit in the first place—only the university could do that, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration froze Northwestern’s research funding. It hasn’t offered the school a way to get it back.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/northwestern-funding-freeze-trump-85d49da2?st=fGDDU3&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nThrough the spring, Northwestern used university money to pay bills previously covered by NIH grants, spending tens of millions of dollars monthly to keep labs and trials running without a break. Researchers and administrators now worry this stopgap can’t last.\n\n\n“The university is totally keeping us on life support,” said Dr. Daniela Matei, a Northwestern oncologist. “The big question is for how long they can do this.”\n\n\nThe sudden collapse of the once-symbiotic relationship between the federal government and higher education is torpedoing a half-century-old university business model and upending how science is done.\n\n\nIt’s a complete turnaround for today’s university researchers, for whom federal funding—from NIH, National Science Foundation, and other agencies—has never been in question. Billions of dollars have flowed annually to universities through competitive grants, funding basic research that can lead to cutting-edge medicine and technological innovations.\n\n\nAt places like Harvard and Columbia, funding cuts or freezes have come with lists of demands spanning changes to admissions and faculty hiring.\n\n\nAt others, like Northwestern, the path to restoration is less clear. In April, a Trump administration official told media that $790 million in federal funds to the Illinois university would be frozen, but that number has never been detailed or communicated directly to school officials, a school spokesman said. Nor has Trump told the university what they can do to get the money returned, the spokesman said, though the school’s president has met with Trump’s education secretary to discuss the situation on campus.\n\n\nUniversity officials say bills to NIH have simply gone unpaid. NIH grant officers in April were told not to communicate with Northwestern and other affected universities about the freeze, according to an email viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Northwestern researchers have had grants terminated or frozen from multiple agencies, the university said.\n\n\nFacing Research Cuts, Officials at U. of Iowa Spoke of a ‘Limited Ability to Publicly Fight This’\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/facing-research-cuts-officials-at-u-of-iowa-spoke-of-a-limited-ability-to-publicly-fight-this\n\nAsked by a faculty member what he and his peers could do to help, the University of Iowa’s interim vice president for research suggested only “acting as a private citizen to call our legislators and tell them what a bad idea this is (from your own phone or using your own email).” The campus’s location in a solidly red state hindered it from fighting the policy change, Lois J. Geist seemed to imply in her reply. “Being located where we are we have limited ability to publicly fight this as faculty or as an institution.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Leaders Call Trump Attacks on Universities a Competitive Threat\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/fed-meeting-interest-rates-stock-market-06-18-2025/card/business-leaders-call-trump-attacks-on-universities-a-competitive-threat-hphDJbcZLTsaa6Bmeqwg\n\nNYTimes: Tuition Increases and Layoffs Are Coming to a Broad Set of Universities\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/tuition-hikes-layoffs-universities.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n(This is the big fear being realized elsewhere)\n\nPublic universities in the Midwest are raising prices for out-of-state students…\n\n\nCornell and Duke are among the colleges weighing layoffs. The University of Minnesota is cutting hundreds of jobs,…\n\n\nStudents and employees from coast to coast are poised to feel the squeeze. Although the exact consequences will vary by school, administrators are warning that many students may have to pay more, professors may lose their jobs, programs could vanish and support services could shrink.\n\n\nThe Trump administration’s efforts to reduce research funding are siphoning cash from many campuses, sometimes by hundreds of millions of dollars. But that is just one factor contributing to higher education’s financial crunch. Colleges, like businesses and households, are facing greater costs for wages, supplies, utilities and other expenses.\n\n\nIn Minnesota, students are set to pay more for less. … Tuition at the Twin Cities campus will rise by at least 6.5 percent. But the university is also pursuing cuts of 7 percent.\n\n(See attempts to soften here:\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/u-of-minnesota-tries-to-soften-the-blow-of-tuition-hikes-budget-cuts-with-faculty-benefits )\n\nTo manage the financial pressures, school leaders said they “anticipate involuntary reductions in head count.”\n\n\nBut Dr. Mitchell, the American Council on Education president, and a former president of Occidental College, emphasized the range of schools that were facing financial headwinds.\n\n\n“This isn’t just the Ivies, and this just isn’t the result of headline freezes on big research projects,” he said. “This reflects more uncertainty in the basic economy.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking Trump’s Higher-Ed Agenda\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda\n(VAC shared)\n\n\n\n\nThe Handwriting Revolution\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/curriculum/2025/06/17/amid-ai-plagiarism-more-professors-turn-handwritten-work\n\nFive semesters after ChatGPT changed education forever, some professors are taking their classes back to the pre-internet era.\n\n\nSo now, Ryckman is switching things up. Starting next semester, she’s planning to have her students write their responses in class to deter the use of AI—and she’s even considering requiring them to write the answers out by hand.\n\n\nYour Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1\n\nWith today’s wide adoption of LLM products like ChatGPT from OpenAI, humans and businesses engage and use LLMs on a daily basis. Like any other tool, it carries its own set of advantages and limitations. This study focuses on finding out the cognitive cost of using an LLM in the educational context of writing an essay.\n\n\nAs the educational impact of LLM use only begins to settle with the general population, in this study we demonstrate the pressing matter of a likely decrease in learning skills based on the results of our study. The use of LLM had a measurable impact on participants, and while the benefits were initially apparent, as we demonstrated over the course of 4 months, the LLM group’s participants performed worse than their counterparts in the Brain-only group at all levels: neural, linguistic, scoring.\n\n\nWhat Will Be Left of Higher Ed in Four Years?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-will-be-left-of-higher-ed-in-four-years\n\nA recent report from the consulting firm Deloitte confirms what everyone working in higher education already knows: Donald Trump “brings a layer of complexity to questions of financial sustainability for colleges and universities.” The administration’s dizzying range of punitive measures for academe comes at an inconvenient time: Our institutions are already grappling with diminished state support and a looming demographic cliff.\n\n\nResearch universities face the greatest financial pressure. Grant cancellations and planned cuts to the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health are creating enormous budgetary holes: The budgets for graduate programs and scientific-research staffing were developed on the assumption that federal funding was a constant.\n\n\nIn red states like Florida, Indiana, and Texas, Trump-supporting Legislatures are also working to bust up faculty and administrative autonomy as a condition of public funding. The administration’s cultural agenda for higher ed is likely to be advanced most fully in states where MAGA-friendly legislatures have near-total control. This doesn’t mean blue-state public research universities are off the hook. Data shows that state financial support for higher ed has been up over the past couple of years, but we might have reached high tide. Ebbing state funding would pair dangerously with cuts to federal research.\n\n\nRegional Publics and Community Colleges\n\n\nAt first glance these institutions appear to be in an enviable position: They don’t rely heavily on federal research funding, they don’t have big endowments to tax, they don’t enroll lots of international students, and they tend to fly below the political radar. Domestic undergraduate enrollment is unlikely to collapse, and a looming economic downturn could even cause an uptick in demand for these institutions since people look to increase their skills and retrain during recessions. Still, the major financial-aid reform provisions tucked away in the “Big, Beautiful” reconciliation bill recently passed by the House will clearly affect these institutions if enacted, though in mixed ways. For community colleges, their lower tuition prices, shorter program duration, and a vocational orientation might yield comparative advantages in a world with diminished federal student aid. Risk-sharing provisions that put campuses on the hook for portions of unpaid student debt might harm minority-serving institutions and campuses that serve low-income and other students with historically higher rates of loan default. Requiring full-time enrollment for Pell Grant eligibility, as proposed in the House bill, would harm these institutions too. The Senate seems less excited about the risk-sharing and full-time Pell provisions, but the financial-aid outlook remains murky.\n\n\nRegional universities and community colleges also face enrollment risks. Pennsylvania State University plans to shutter several regional campuses, and federal pressure on research universities will have knock-on effects within state university systems. Looking to secure their own budgets, research universities might employ aggressive tactics to lure students otherwise headed to regional campuses.\n\n\nRather than forming partnerships with the federal government, colleges will now have to endure the headwinds created by federal policy and, in some cases, engage in direct confrontation with the administration. I do not believe Trump will be able to destroy American higher education, but his administration will try, and the sector will suffer. Research footprints will shrink, the number of programs and activities on offer will be reduced, and the workloads of already-overextended faculty and staff will increase. Senior administrators can’t say so, but in the next few years colleges and universities will become diminished versions of themselves. Those of us who teach or work in higher ed will watch our institutions decline.\n\n\nCampuses will look for revenue to replace federal dollars. Public research universities will increase their enrollments, often at the expense of their regional counterparts. Our wealthiest colleges may quietly roll back their need-blind admissions policies. The steady trickle of emails from university communications announcing exciting new cancer research efforts and new science facilities will slow. Departmental budgets will be slashed to the point where faculty concern is less for vanishing tenure lines than for the survival of the department itself. Teaching course loads will grow, library operational hours will shrink, and students, stung by loan restrictions and red tape, will increasingly rush from class to part-time jobs. In short, the sector will be smaller, poorer, and capable of doing fewer things.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Data Shows Attendance Fosters Student Success\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/student-success/academic-life/2025/06/13/data-shows-attendance-improves-student-success\n(Some headlines write themselves)\n\nWho’s missing class? It’s not uncommon for a student to miss class for illness or an outside conflict, but higher rates of absence among college students in recent years are giving professors pause.\n\n\nMore than 30 percent of students who attended community college in person skipped class sometimes in the past year, a 2023 study found; 4 percent said they skipped class often or very often.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, some links are behind paywalls.

But Tulane leaders have chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.”\n\n\n“It started with the pro-Palestinian activism on our campus and others across the country. It’s emboldened a lot of political leaders to feel they can make inroads by silencing faculty in other areas,” Michelle Lacey, a math professor and president of Tulane’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, told Inside Higher Ed. “That was the catalyst for creating a climate where university administrators are very nervous, especially now as we see the government pulling funding for areas of research they don’t like.”\n\n\nLast summer, he [Governor Landry, Trump aligned[ enacted a law that allows him to directly appoint board chairs at the state’s public colleges and universities.

The ostensible reason offered is so that State Department officials can conduct additional vetting of visas applicants, by reviewing their social media accounts. According to reports, the cable reads: “Effective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consular sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor (F, M, and J) visa appointment capacity until further guidance is issued [in a separate, forthcoming telegram], which we anticipate in the coming days.”\n\n\nState Dept. restarts student visa interviews with tougher social media rules\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/18/student-visas-social-media-vetting-state-department/\n\nAs staff members examine students’ profiles, the cable instructed, they must look to “identify applicants who bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles; who advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists and other threats to U.S. national security; or who perpetrate unlawful antisemitic harassment or violence.”\n\n\nOne State department official noted that the agency issued 446,000 student visas in 2023. “If everyone has to now have their social media scrubbed for derogatory information? Officers do not have that time.”\n\n\nThe cable suggested that State Department officials should request that applicants make public and accessible all portions of their social media accounts and should penalize them if they refuse.\n\n\nIf portions of accounts remain “set to ‘private’ or otherwise limited, you should treat the case as any other where an applicant fails to provide certain information on request,” the cable stated.

    "text": "How Universities Would Overhaul Research Funding\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/06/18/university-leaders-weigh-changes-research\n\nNow, after just over six weeks of work, that group known as the Joint Associations Group is homing in on a plan to rework how the government funds research, and they want feedback from the university research community before they present a proposal to Congress and the Trump administration at the end of the month.\n\n\n“Unfortunately, something is going to change,” said Barbara Snyder, president of the Association of American Universities. “Either we will be part of it or it will be imposed upon us … Significant division in the research community is going to kill us.”\n\n\nBoth versions of what JAG is calling the Fiscal Accountability in Research model, or FAIR, are geared toward offering more accountability and transparency about how federal research dollars are spent. JAG hopes that in the end, the new model will be simpler than the current one. They also want to nix terms like “indirect costs rate” and “overhead” for either essential research support or general research operations in an effort to underscore that the money goes toward the real costs of research.\n\n\nOne model, which the group calls FAIR No. 1, would include costs related to managing the grant, general research operations and facilities as a fixed percentage of the total budget. The percentage would be based in part on the type of institution and research. This approach is designed to be simple and reasonable, according to the group’s presentation, but it’s more general, which makes it “difficult to account for the wide array of research frameworks that now exist.”\n\n\nThe other model, FAIR No. 2, would more accurately reflect the actual costs of a project and make the structure for federal grants more like those from private foundations. Under this model, essential research support would be lumped into the project costs while funding for general research operations, such as payroll and procurement, would be a fixed percentage of the total budget. That change would likely increase the direct costs of the project.\n\n\nResearch Grants Increasingly Require Compliance With Trump’s Orders. Here’s How Colleges Are Responding.\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/research-grants-increasingly-require-compliance-with-trumps-orders-heres-how-colleges-are-responding\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the conditions for accepting federal funding have become increasingly partisan. The Chronicle first reported in May that at least two notice-of-award letters from the National Institutes of Health, which are legal documents spelling out the terms of grants, mandated compliance with Trump’s executive order recognizing only two sexes, effectively excluding transgender people from U.S. policy.\n\n\nNow, according to scientists and colleges contacted by The Chronicle, an increasing number of grant letters — from the NIH and other agencies — require compliance with one or more of Trump’s executive orders and with civil-rights laws, which Trump has sought to reinterpret.\n\n\nIn one striking example of the ever-changing environment, the NIH announced a policy in April that required grantees to attest that they don’t operate “illegal” diversity, equity, and inclusion programs or support boycotts of Israel when accepting federal funds. But over the past week, the policy was abruptly rescinded, then put back in place, then rescinded again without explanation.\n\n\nA federal judge announced a short-term win for scientists on Monday, ruling that Trump’s termination of hundreds of grants because they referenced DEI or LGBTQ issues was discriminatory, and ordering the government to restore the funding.\n\n\nHow Senate Republicans Want to Hold Colleges Accountable\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/06/20/how-senate-republicans-want-hold-colleges-accountable\n\nThe high chamber’s proposal, which ties a university’s access to federal loans to how much their students earn after graduation, is simpler and more productive than the House proposal, known as risk-sharing, which would require colleges to pay an annual penalty based on their students’ outstanding loan balances, they say.\n\n\nThe Senate plan seems to be based on an existing regulation known as gainful employment, which uses students’ earnings and debt to measure whether for-profit and non-degree programs adequately prepare their students for the workforce. But Republicans who sponsored the bill and expanded its reach to all degree programs have been wary of drawing attention to the overlap, as lawmakers have avoided calling it anything like “gainful employment 2.0” or “gainful for all.”\n\n\nRepublicans have historically opposed the Democratic policy, which was first put in place during the Obama administration, saying it unfairly targeted for-profit programs and that a free market would be the best way to regulate the quality of academic programs.\n\n\nCongressional Republicans Want to End Grad PLUS Loans. How Might It Affect Your Campus?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/congressional-republicans-want-to-end-grad-plus-loans-how-might-it-affect-your-campus\n\nCongressional Republicans appear set to effectively shut down the 20-year-old Grad PLUS federal student-loan program as House and Senate lawmakers seek passage of a sprawling set of budget cuts, tax adjustments, and policy changes — bundled together and branded by President Trump as the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n\nwould see the Grad PLUS loan program, which had been expected to lend out roughly $19 billion annually between 2026-34, phased out for new borrowers starting in the 2026-27 academic year. The program would eventually be mothballed for all borrowers starting in the 2029-30 academic year.\n\n(The interactive table has some detail\n\n\n\nCollege\nN\nDisbursement\n\n\n\n\nCCNY\n180\n3.3M\n\n\nGC\n193\n2.6M\n\n\nHunter\n114\n1.7M\n\n\nBaruch\n79\n1.6M\n\n\n\nBrooklyn, John Jay, York, Lehman, Queens, CSI also impacted ~ 2M combined)\n\nBut without access to Grad PLUS financing, said Suzanne Ortega, president of the Council of Graduate Schools, graduate-level education will either become unattainable for some students or “force them into high-cost private debt, exacerbating the student-debt crisis and existing work-force shortages in critical fields like teaching, law enforcement, public-health professions, and engineers.”\n\n\n\n\nTrump is undermining U.S. science. Here’s why that’s dangerous.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/18/trump-science-attacks-internet/\n\nThe evisceration of the National Science Foundation (NSF) — including wholesale firings, budget-slashing and arbitrary elimination of grants — is especially worrisome to those of us who understand the crucial role science has played in making America a great and powerful nation. Congress must act soon to halt this devastating attack.\n\n\nAt its heart was a management ethos borrowed from successful wartime research: the idea that knowledgeable scientists could identify the most fruitful topics and the best ways to pursue them. T\n\n\nIn the past, the NSF has usually enjoyed bipartisan support from both presidents and members of Congress. But the ravages currently being inflicted upon the agency may bring a truly golden era of American science to a halt. The February dismissal of 168 “probationary” NSF employees included career scientists newly arrived from academic positions to work as program managers familiar with the scientific disciplines they were to oversee. Though some have been reinstated by court order, the chilling uncertainty this ill-considered action instills in the NSF workforce and its grantees can seriously harm U.S. science.\n\n\nWhat’s worse, the 2026 fiscal year Trump budget calls for slashing $5 billion from the current $9 billion NSF budget.

Its funding has sparked countless medical breakthroughs — on cancer, diabetes, strokes — and plays a fundamental role in the development of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\n\nThe NIH has rarely revoked funding once it has been awarded. Out of the tens of thousands of grants overseen by the institution since 2012, it terminated fewer than five for violations of the agency’s terms and conditions.\n\n\nThen Donald Trump was reelected.\n\n\nSince his January inauguration, his administration has terminated more than 1,450 grants, withholding more than $750 million in funds; officials have said they are curbing wasteful spending and “unscientific” research.\n\n\nThe mass cancellation of grants in response to political policy shifts has no precedent, former and current NIH officials told ProPublica. It threatens the stability of the institution and the scientific enterprise of the nation at large.\n\n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of the toll, ProPublica reached out to more than 500 researchers, scientists and investigators whose grants were terminated. More than 150 responded to share their experiences, which reveal consequences that experts say run counter to scientific logic and even common sense.\n\n(Well worth reading to gain a sense of scale of this sabotage)\n\nTrump’s NIH Axed Research Grants Despite Court Order — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/trump-nih-cuts-transgender-research-grants\n(And more details on sabotage at the NIH)\n\nNearly two weeks after the court’s preliminary injunction was issued, the National Institutes of Health’s then-acting head, Dr. Matthew J. Memoli, drafted a memo that details how the agency, in response to Trump’s executive orders, cut funding for research grants that “promote or inculcate gender ideology.” An internal spreadsheet of terminated NIH grants also references “gender ideology” and lists the number associated with Trump’s executive order as the reason for the termination of more than a half dozen research grants. [Yet, “Lawyers for the federal government have repeatedly claimed in court filings that the administration has been complying with the order (stopping it from cutting funding related to gender identity and the provision of gender-affirming care in response to President Donald Trump’s executive orders)”]\n\n\nThe Washington attorney general’s allegation that the Trump administration violated a court order comes as the country lurches toward a constitutional crisis amid accusations that the executive branch has defied or ignored court orders in several other cases.\n\n\nin depositions filed in the case last week, two NIH officials testified that DOGE itself gave directions in hundreds of grant terminations.\n\n\nThe lawsuit offers an unprecedented view into the termination of more than 600 grants at the NIH over the past two months. Many of the canceled grants appear to have focused on subjects that the administration claims are unscientific or that the agency should no longer focus on under new priorities, such as gender identity, vaccine hesitancy and diversity, equity and inclusion. Grants related to research in China have also been cut, and climate change projects are under scrutiny.\n\n\nMike Faulk, the deputy communications director for the Washington state attorney general’s office, told ProPublica in an email that the administration “appears to have used DOGE in this instance to keep career NIH officials in the dark about what was happening and why.” “While claiming to be transparent, DOGE has actively hidden its activities and its true motivations,” he said.\n\n\n“Their claim to have complied with the preliminary injunction is almost laughable,” said Faulk, the office’s deputy communications director. “The Trump administration is playing games with no apparent respect for the rule of law.”\n\n\nThe executive order detailing DOGE’s responsibilities describes the cost-cutting team as advisers that consult agency heads on the termination of contracts and grants. No language in the orders gives the DOGE team members the authority to direct the cancellation of grants or contracts. However, the depositions portray Riley [former consultant for McKinsey & Co. and DOGE member] as giving directions on how to conduct the terminations.\n\n\nJeremy Berg, who led the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the NIH from 2003 to 2011, told ProPublica that the administration’s assessment of the institution was “not fair and not based on any substantial analysis or evidence,” and the proposed cuts “would be absolutely devastating to NIH and to biomedical research in the United States.”\n\n\nJudge Rejects Trump’s ‘Appalling’ NIH LGBTQ, Race Grant Cuts\n\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/judge-clashes-with-trump-justice-department-over-nih-grant-cuts\n(Thanks KB)\n\n“This represents racial discrimination and discrimination against America’s LGBTQ community. That’s what this is,” said Judge William G. Young of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts. “I would be blind not to call it out. My duty is to call it out.”\n\n(Also, from VAC)\nhttps://www.axios.com/local/boston/2025/06/16/nih-grants-ordered-restored\n(Also)\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/16/us/trump-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\n\n\nUniversities Sue, Judge Blocks DOD’s Indirect Costs Cap\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/20/universities-sue-judge-blocks-dods-indirect-costs-cap\n\nJohns Hopkins, Arizona State and Cornell Universities are among a coalition of 12 higher education institutions and three trade groups that filed a lawsuit against the Department of Defense on Monday over the agency’s plan to cap universities’ indirect research cost rates at 15 percent.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge in Boston issued a temporary restraining order, prohibiting the DOD from enacting the cap. A hearing in the case is set for July 2.\n\n\nFor example, Johns Hopkins and the DOD currently have in place a negotiated indirect cost rate of 55 percent. In 2024 JHU received $32 million from the DOD to cover indirect costs, according to the lawsuit. If the DOD’s plan moves forward, however, the university would lose $22 million."

On Wednesday, the advocacy group joined the state of Tennessee in suing the U.S. Department of Education, arguing that the criteria to become an HSI are unconstitutional and discriminatory. The move is distressing HSI advocates, who hoped to see the institutions left out of the political fray.\n\n\nFunding for Hispanic-Serving Institutions Is Discriminatory and Unconstitutional, Lawsuit Argues\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/funding-for-hispanic-serving-institution-is-discriminatory-unconstitutional-lawsuit-argues\n(Thanks VAC)\n\nNew state laws target job protections for college professors\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/18/tenure-college-faculty-republican-challenges/\nhttps://hechingerreport.org/special-reports/higher-education/\n\nHONOLULU — The “gravy train.” That’s what a Hawaii state senator called the practice of awarding tenure to university research faculty when she proposed legislation in 2022 stripping this long-standing form of job protection from them.\n\n\nThe bill got little notice at the time. Now, obscured by the turmoil of the many other challenges to higher education since the start of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, tenure has come under siege in states across the country.\n\n\n“It’s the flip side of the same assault,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, or AFT, which represents 400,000 faculty and other university and college employees. “Some of the assault is coming from taking away grants, and some of the assault is coming by taking away tenure.”\n\n(But it doesn’t seem to be driven by a newly appointed leader)\n\n“To me, it’s about the Senate wanting control over the university,” said Christian Fern, executive director of the University of Hawai‘i Professional Assembly, the faculty union.\n\n(States mentioned: Hawaii, Nebraska, Ohio, Kentucky, Texas, Indiana, Arkansas, North Dakota, Kansas)\n\n“This level of attack couldn’t gain the kind of momentum it has without the declining public support for higher education,” Reuben [Harvard historian] said. “It couldn’t have happened to this magnitude before, because there was a general sense that higher education was good for society.”"

If they succeed, it could affect about 7,000 international scholars and potentially deliver a disabling blow to the campus’s finances, curriculum and identity.\n\n\nIn their court filing, Harvard’s lawyers argued that broad language was necessary because the government had “committed to continuing — indeed to intensifying — its retaliatory campaign,” one that can “throw Harvard and its international community into turmoil.”\n\n\nThe litigation, which is one of two cases Harvard has filed against the Trump administration, began last month when the Department of Homeland Security said it was revoking Harvard’s ability to host students under a system called the Student Exchange and Visitor Program.\n\n\nA lawyer for Harvard, Ian Gershengorn, accused the administration of resorting to “shenanigans” in its efforts to bar foreign students from Harvard.\n\n\nHarvard has said the actions aren’t grounded in real violations but instead are retaliation for its refusal to bend to the administration’s will.\n\n\nJudge Waits to Rule on Trump’s Effort to Bar Harvard Foreign Students\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/06/17/judge-delays-ruling-trump-ban-harvard-foreign\n\nIn a hearing on Monday, a federal judge put off making a ruling on whether to continue blocking President Trump’s proclamation banning Harvard international students and researchers from entering the country. The judge, Allison Burroughs of the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, agreed to decide within a week and extended an order to temporarily halt the policy until then.\n\n\nThe hearing came after Harvard swiftly filed a legal challenge to Trump’s directive in early June, a day after it was issued. Burroughs quickly granted a temporary restraining order and is now weighing a longer-lasting injunction.\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Negotiation or Capitulation? How Columbia Got Off Trump’s Hot Seat.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/nyregion/columbia-middle-east-studies-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nWhile many in the academic world have accused Columbia of caving to Mr. Trump’s pressure, the university’s strategy — so far — has limited the bleeding, even as Harvard has absorbed cut after cut, stretching into billions of dollars. While opponents of the Trump administration’s crackdown have lauded Harvard for standing its ground, it is far from clear which school will be better off in the long run. And the question remains whether Columbia’s path can offer a road map for other universities attacked by the president.\n\n\nStill, the federal Department of Education threatened Columbia’s accreditation in early June, saying that in its eyes, the school was no longer meeting the standards necessary for the key credential, alleging it had “acted with deliberate indifference” toward the harassment of Jewish students.\n\n\n“There is a basic principle of academic freedom that is under attack, but I still believe in it,” he said. “And I think everybody in this department believes in it. And I think the students we teach believe in it.”\n\n\nFederal Judge Dismisses AAUP Lawsuit Challenging Columbia Grant Freezes\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/17/judge-dismisses-lawsuit-over-columbia-grant-freezes\n\nJudge Mary Kay Vyskocil of the Southern District of New York, however, ruled that the unions had no standing to file the lawsuit in the first place—only the university could do that, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration froze Northwestern’s research funding. It hasn’t offered the school a way to get it back.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/northwestern-funding-freeze-trump-85d49da2?st=fGDDU3&reflink=article_gmail_share\n\nThrough the spring, Northwestern used university money to pay bills previously covered by NIH grants, spending tens of millions of dollars monthly to keep labs and trials running without a break. Researchers and administrators now worry this stopgap can’t last.\n\n\n“The university is totally keeping us on life support,” said Dr. Daniela Matei, a Northwestern oncologist. “The big question is for how long they can do this.”\n\n\nThe sudden collapse of the once-symbiotic relationship between the federal government and higher education is torpedoing a half-century-old university business model and upending how science is done.\n\n\nIt’s a complete turnaround for today’s university researchers, for whom federal funding—from NIH, National Science Foundation, and other agencies—has never been in question. Billions of dollars have flowed annually to universities through competitive grants, funding basic research that can lead to cutting-edge medicine and technological innovations.\n\n\nAt places like Harvard and Columbia, funding cuts or freezes have come with lists of demands spanning changes to admissions and faculty hiring.\n\n\nAt others, like Northwestern, the path to restoration is less clear. In April, a Trump administration official told media that $790 million in federal funds to the Illinois university would be frozen, but that number has never been detailed or communicated directly to school officials, a school spokesman said. Nor has Trump told the university what they can do to get the money returned, the spokesman said, though the school’s president has met with Trump’s education secretary to discuss the situation on campus.\n\n\nUniversity officials say bills to NIH have simply gone unpaid. NIH grant officers in April were told not to communicate with Northwestern and other affected universities about the freeze, according to an email viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Northwestern researchers have had grants terminated or frozen from multiple agencies, the university said.\n\n\nFacing Research Cuts, Officials at U. of Iowa Spoke of a ‘Limited Ability to Publicly Fight This’\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/facing-research-cuts-officials-at-u-of-iowa-spoke-of-a-limited-ability-to-publicly-fight-this\n\nAsked by a faculty member what he and his peers could do to help, the University of Iowa’s interim vice president for research suggested only “acting as a private citizen to call our legislators and tell them what a bad idea this is (from your own phone or using your own email).” The campus’s location in a solidly red state hindered it from fighting the policy change, Lois J. Geist seemed to imply in her reply. “Being located where we are we have limited ability to publicly fight this as faculty or as an institution.”"

But that is just one factor contributing to higher education’s financial crunch. Colleges, like businesses and households, are facing greater costs for wages, supplies, utilities and other expenses.\n\n\nIn Minnesota, students are set to pay more for less. … Tuition at the Twin Cities campus will rise by at least 6.5 percent.

Starting next semester, she’s planning to have her students write their responses in class to deter the use of AI—and she’s even considering requiring them to write the answers out by hand.\n\n\nYour Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1\n\nWith today’s wide adoption of LLM products like ChatGPT from OpenAI, humans and businesses engage and use LLMs on a daily basis. Like any other tool, it carries its own set of advantages and limitations. This study focuses on finding out the cognitive cost of using an LLM in the educational context of writing an essay.\n\n\nAs the educational impact of LLM use only begins to settle with the general population, in this study we demonstrate the pressing matter of a likely decrease in learning skills based on the results of our study. The use of LLM had a measurable impact on participants, and while the benefits were initially apparent, as we demonstrated over the course of 4 months, the LLM group’s participants performed worse than their counterparts in the Brain-only group at all levels: neural, linguistic, scoring.\n\n\nWhat Will Be Left of Higher Ed in Four Years?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/what-will-be-left-of-higher-ed-in-four-years\n\nA recent report from the consulting firm Deloitte confirms what everyone working in higher education already knows: Donald Trump “brings a layer of complexity to questions of financial sustainability for colleges and universities.” The administration’s dizzying range of punitive measures for academe comes at an inconvenient time: Our institutions are already grappling with diminished state support and a looming demographic cliff.\n\n\nResearch universities face the greatest financial pressure. Grant cancellations and planned cuts to the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health are creating enormous budgetary holes: The budgets for graduate programs and scientific-research staffing were developed on the assumption that federal funding was a constant.\n\n\nIn red states like Florida, Indiana, and Texas, Trump-supporting Legislatures are also working to bust up faculty and administrative autonomy as a condition of public funding. The administration’s cultural agenda for higher ed is likely to be advanced most fully in states where MAGA-friendly legislatures have near-total control. This doesn’t mean blue-state public research universities are off the hook. Data shows that state financial support for higher ed has been up over the past couple of years, but we might have reached high tide. Ebbing state funding would pair dangerously with cuts to federal research.\n\n\nRegional Publics and Community Colleges\n\n\nAt first glance these institutions appear to be in an enviable position: They don’t rely heavily on federal research funding, they don’t have big endowments to tax, they don’t enroll lots of international students, and they tend to fly below the political radar. Domestic undergraduate enrollment is unlikely to collapse, and a looming economic downturn could even cause an uptick in demand for these institutions since people look to increase their skills and retrain during recessions. Still, the major financial-aid reform provisions tucked away in the “Big, Beautiful” reconciliation bill recently passed by the House will clearly affect these institutions if enacted, though in mixed ways. For community colleges, their lower tuition prices, shorter program duration, and a vocational orientation might yield comparative advantages in a world with diminished federal student aid. Risk-sharing provisions that put campuses on the hook for portions of unpaid student debt might harm minority-serving institutions and campuses that serve low-income and other students with historically higher rates of loan default. Requiring full-time enrollment for Pell Grant eligibility, as proposed in the House bill, would harm these institutions too. The Senate seems less excited about the risk-sharing and full-time Pell provisions, but the financial-aid outlook remains murky.\n\n\nRegional universities and community colleges also face enrollment risks. Pennsylvania State University plans to shutter several regional campuses, and federal pressure on research universities will have knock-on effects within state university systems. Looking to secure their own budgets, research universities might employ aggressive tactics to lure students otherwise headed to regional campuses.\n\n\nRather than forming partnerships with the federal government, colleges will now have to endure the headwinds created by federal policy and, in some cases, engage in direct confrontation with the administration. I do not believe Trump will be able to destroy American higher education, but his administration will try, and the sector will suffer. Research footprints will shrink, the number of programs and activities on offer will be reduced, and the workloads of already-overextended faculty and staff will increase. Senior administrators can’t say so, but in the next few years colleges and universities will become diminished versions of themselves. Those of us who teach or work in higher ed will watch our institutions decline.\n\n\nCampuses will look for revenue to replace federal dollars. Public research universities will increase their enrollments, often at the expense of their regional counterparts. Our wealthiest colleges may quietly roll back their need-blind admissions policies. The steady trickle of emails from university communications announcing exciting new cancer research efforts and new science facilities will slow. Departmental budgets will be slashed to the point where faculty concern is less for vanishing tenure lines than for the survival of the department itself. Teaching course loads will grow, library operational hours will shrink, and students, stung by loan restrictions and red tape, will increasingly rush from class to part-time jobs. In short, the sector will be smaller, poorer, and capable of doing fewer things."

Despite the public’s declining confidence in institutions of higher education, 76 percent of Americans think a college education is very or somewhat important for success. Ninety percent of Democrats, 71 percent of Republicans and 72 percent of Independents agree that a college education is at least somewhat important.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Republican Plot to Un-Educate America | The New Republic\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/197017/budget-bill-kill-higher-education\n\nTrump’s “big, beautiful bill” is an extinction-level event for higher education that would annihilate the country’s intellectual potential.\n\n\nFor colleges and universities, the potential fallout is hard to overstate. Whatever schools survive are likely to be drained of working- and middle-class families, instead populated only by society’s most wealthy. As it is, millions of people rightly consider universities to be a costly endeavor that is irrelevant to their everyday life. But rather than remaking higher ed into a vibrant and more democratic institution, this bill threatens to do the opposite. It will cement the stereotype of higher education as an elite institution into an ironclad reality. On June 25, student debtors and their allies will be protesting these devastating cuts in Washington, D.C. But so far, very few elected officials are sounding the alarm on these issues with the fever pitch they deserve, let alone doing the work required to slow down and obstruct their passage into law.\n\n\nIn the words of influential conservative activist Christopher Rufo, “Reforming the student loan programs could put the whole university sector into a significant recession” and state of “existential terror.” The goal is to use economic policy to impose an unpopular and stifling ideological agenda, exacted by punitive student debt.\n\n\nThese cuts won’t just harm students who rely on loans to afford college; they will take the doors off colleges’ and universities’ capacity to expand minds and redistribute opportunity. Lost revenue will encourage schools to close programs, squeeze staff, and perhaps shutter entirely. A proposed endowment tax for colleges and universities has prompted fury among higher education lobbyists, but those players have said very little about the bill’s vigorous imposition of debt as a tool of social control.\n\n\nContemporary Republicans are even more brazen. Consider a recent report released by the Heritage Foundation that recommends terminating higher education “subsidies” and student loan cancellation in order to “increase the married birthrate.” What does this goulash mean in plain English?\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Freedom Was Already Limited at U.S. Service Academies. Then Came Trump.\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/06/23/academic-freedom-service-academies-dissipates-under\n(Thanks BE for sharing)\n\nOfficials are restricting education about diversity and criticism of the U.S. It’s an erosion of rights within the institutions training America’s future military officers.\n\n\nA week into his second presidential term, Donald Trump issued an executive order banning service academies under the Defense Department—the U.S Military Academy at West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Air Force Academy—from “promoting, advancing, or otherwise inculcating the following un-American, divisive, discriminatory, radical, extremist, and irrational theories.” The theories listed were “divisive concepts,” “gender ideology,” race or sex “stereotyping” and “scapegoating,” and the idea “that America’s founding documents are racist or sexist.”\n\n\nThe Times also reported that Christopher Barth, West Point’s senior librarian, is resigning after 14 years amid demands that he identify books that might violate Hegseth’s order. West Point didn’t answer most questions that Inside Higher Ed posed to it, including whether books have actually been removed.\n\n\nAt the Naval Academy, Tom McCarthy resigned from his role as history department chair this month, The Baltimore Sun reported.

Simon often assigns readings that describe how the families her students might one day serve have been impacted by more than a century of housing, employment, and education discrimination. The associate professor has encouraged her students to engage in spirited discussions about race, even assigning a project in which they advocate for or against a social-justice issue.\n\n\nDoing any of those things today, she argues in a federal lawsuit, could get her fired from the state flagship, where she’s taught for 25 years. Last year, the state’s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, signed into law a sweeping bill that restricts what professors can teach about race. If any of their lessons veer into what conservative politicians have deemed “divisive concepts,” faculty members risk being reported, investigated, and potentially fired.\n\n\nBut over the past two years, more than a dozen laws have been enacted that either limit which classes can be taught or imposed restrictions on what professors can say in the classroom, according to a Chronicle analysis of state legislation and a compilation of what PEN America calls “educational gag orders.”\n\n\nThis year especially “has been a banner year for censorship at a state level across the country,” said Amy B. Reid, senior manager at PEN America’s Freedom to Learn program. “The point of a lot of these restrictions is to put people on guard, worried that anything or everything could be prohibited so you really have to watch what you say.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas looks to enact restrictions on when and how students can protest\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/20/texas-campus-speech-law-palestine-protests/\n\nSenate Bill 2972 prohibits protesting between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m., or during the last two weeks of the semester; and bans students from camping or erecting tents on campus, or wearing a disguise to conceal their identity. It also bars the use of microphones and drums.\n\n\nRepublicans in Texas say the proposal will prevent campus disruption and intimidation seen during last year’s pro-Palestinian protests. But critics across the political spectrum, such as the free speech advocacy group Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, say the proposal is too broad and threatens all forms of expressive activity.\n\n\n“Wearing a MAGA hat or a Bernie [Sanders] T-shirt would be prohibited between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. because the political apparel is an expressive act, and therefore covered as an expressive activity,” said Tyler Coward, FIRE’s lead counsel for government affairs.\n\n\nUnder the proposed law, universities could bar a guest speaker from campus if school officials believe there will be a large protest, Coward said.\n\n\nTexas Governor Signs Bill to Limit Expressive Activity on Campuses\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/free-speech/2025/06/23/texas-passes-bill-limiting-expressive-activity-campus\n\nTexas governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial bill that would restrict expressive activities on college campuses, reversing some of the rights afforded by a 2019 bill intended to protect Texans’ ability to protest on campuses.\n\n\nTexas Governor Signs Law Giving Presidents Control of Faculty Senates\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/24/texas-passes-law-presidents-control-faculty-senates\n(These were highlighted in an earlier digest, but worth repeating…)\n\nSenate Bill 37 says that only an institution’s governing board can create a faculty council or senate. If a board decides to keep one, the college or university president gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary” and prescribe how the body conducts meetings.\n\n\nUnless the institution’s board decides otherwise, faculty governing bodies must shrink to no more than 60 members. The Texas A&M University Faculty Senate currently has 122.\n\n\nThe 60 members must include at least two representatives from each of the colleges and schools that comprise the institution—including what the law describes vaguely as “one member appointed by the president or chief executive officer of the institution,” with the rest elected by the faculty of the particular school or college. This could mean that half of a faculty senate would be chosen by the president, barring an exemption by the institution’s board.\n\n\nSB 37 also says an institution’s provost can recommend to the president that members be “immediately removed” for failing to attend meetings or not conducting their “responsibilities within the council’s or senate’s parameters,” or for “similar misconduct.”\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Says He Wants to Fund More Trade Schools.

It also created a new point of contention in President Trump’s efforts to cut costs by dismantling elements of the social safety net. As Congress debates a budget bill that would reduce funding for federal anti-poverty programs such as Medicaid and food benefits, the White House is also proposing that the Job Corps, with its nearly $1.8 billion budget, be eliminated.\n\n\nTrump DEI Purge Made Black Women in Federal Jobs an “Easy Target” — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/trump-dei-black-women-minorities-careers-jobs-dismissed\n\nHer experience is part of a largely untold story unfolding as Trump dismantles civil rights and inclusion programs across government: Many of those being forced out, like Crowner, are Black women who spent decades building a career of government service, only to see those careers shattered in a sudden purge.\n\n\nNYTimes: How Trump Treats Black History Differently Than Other Parts of America’s Past\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/politics/trump-black-history-federal-holidays.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nChad Williams, a historian and professor of African American and Black diaspora studies at Boston University, said Mr. Trump’s actions, taken as a whole, showed that the administration was seeking to craft a “propaganda version of history.”\n\n\n“They’re trying to erase the history of Black struggle and Black resistance by denying the realities of racism and white supremacy,” Mr. Williams said. “They’re crafting a history that romanticizes the past at the expense of a true telling of the complexities and nuances of the American experience.”\n\n\nHBCUs Reel as Trump Cuts Black-Focused Grants: ‘This Is Our Existence’\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/hbcus-reel-as-trump-cuts-black-focused-grants-this-is-our-existence\n\nIn less than three years, Quick [Tennessee State University’s Quincy Quick] helped raise $100 million in research grants, launch an AI research center, and bring Tennessee State significantly closer to becoming the second historically Black college and university to receive Research I status. But many of those grants focused on serving Black students and Black communities, a core part of the land-grant institution’s mission.\n\n\nAs the VPs fretted over how they would retain vital research grants, one administrator quipped, “HBCUs won’t be affected because they don’t look at HBCUs as DEI.”\n\n\nQuick, the only HBCU administrator in attendance, recalled thinking, “That’s ridiculous, and it’s absolutely naïve. We absolutely would get hit. … And that’s exactly what has happened.”\n\n\nIn total, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation have canceled more than $140 million in grants at HBCUs since March, according to a Chronicle analysis of two databases tracking grant cancellations.\n\n\nThe NIH in March said that plans to enhance diversity are no longer required in training-grant applications, and “those included in applications under review will not be evaluated or considered in funding decisions.”\n\n\nThe NSF said in April that research supported by the federal government must “aim to create opportunities for all Americans everywhere.” Federally supported research on protected groups must be open to all nonprotected groups.\n\n\nThe agency has not provided guidance on what initiatives are considered DEI.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Justice Dept. Pressuring University of Virginia President to Resign\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/us/politics/university-of-virginia-president-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Trump administration has privately demanded that the University of Virginia oust its president to help resolve a Justice Department investigation into the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, according to three people briefed on the matter.\n\n\nThe extraordinary condition the Justice Department has put on the school demonstrates that President Trump’s bid to shift the ideological tilt of the higher education system, which he views as hostile to conservatives, is more far-reaching than previously understood.\n\n\nJustice Department officials have told University of Virginia officials that hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding are at risk because of what the department says is the school’s disregard for civil rights law over its diversity practices, according to two of the people.\n\n\nThe demand to remove Mr. Ryan was made over the past month on several occasions by Gregory Brown, the deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights\n\n\nHarmeet K. Dhillon, the Justice Department’s top civil rights lawyer, has also been involved in negotiations with the university.\n\n\nBefore becoming the University of Virginia’s president, Mr. Ryan served as the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he was praised for his commitment to D.E.I. programs.\n\n\nThe administration’s attempt to assert federal influence over state university leadership decisions is also illustrative of how Mr. Trump’s political appointees continue to wield the Justice Department’s investigative powers to achieve policy goals long sought by a top Trump adviser, Stephen Miller.\n\n\nBut Mr. Ryan has been singled out by the Trump administration as his steps toward compliance have been criticized by conservative groups as insufficient. America First Legal, a nonprofit started by Mr. Miller, last month accused the University of Virginia of paying lip service to Mr. Trump’s orders by simply running the same diversity programs under a different name. The group issued a news release last month that called on the Justice Department to “hold UVA accountable.”\n\n(also here)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda\n\nNYTimes: How Trump Upended 60 Years of Civil Rights in Two Months\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/27/magazine/trump-civil-rights-law-discrimination.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast year, a little-known office in the U.S. Department of Labor helped Black workers at a Texas medical center recover $900,000 in back wages, and Black workers at a Caterpillar manufacturing plant in Illinois recover $800,000, each time over allegations that those applicants lost out on jobs because of their race. Called the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, this division investigates and fights employment discrimination for one-fifth of the U.S. labor force. It was created in 1965 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an executive order strengthening the provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned racial discrimination by employers.\n\n\nOn his second day in office, President Donald Trump labeled O.F.C.C.P.’s efforts to enforce the 1964 Civil Rights Act illegal and discriminatory — presumably against white people. He signed his own executive order revoking Johnson’s on behalf of, as he put it, “hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American dream.”\n\n\nYet in the opening months of his second term, Trump has capitalized on the unpopularity of equality efforts among some Americans, glibly wielding the language of D.E.I. to initiate the broadest and most significant assault on civil rights and racial integration in this country in more than a century.\n\n\nConservatives have spent decades chipping away both at civil rights protections and the national will to address racial inequality. Since the racial reckoning of 2020, Republicans have toppled affirmative action in college admissions and waged an enormously successful campaign to make the language of equity and inclusion anathema, to label books and lessons about the nation’s history “anti-white” and “divisive” and to prohibit everything from Black studies to university diversity offices. And earlier this month, the Supreme Court, which over the years has made it increasingly challenging for Black Americans to prove discrimination, has now made it easier for straight white people to do so.\n\n\nThe Education Department sent a letter to all educational institutions receiving federal funds asserting without evidence that they were engaging in “pervasive and repugnant race-based” discrimination against white and Asian students. Federal data shows that Black students are disproportionately concentrated in schools with fewer resources and less funding, and experience significant academic disparities. And yet the letter told public schools and universities that they had 14 days to purge all diversity and equity efforts — which include programs that try to help diversify teaching staffs and help Black students close the achievement gaps they suffer from nationwide — or lose access to federal funds.\n\n\nBut probably the starkest change is the redirecting of the Department of Justice away from fighting anti-Black discrimination and toward eliminating integration efforts. Harmeet Dhillon, the new head of the department’s Civil Rights Division, sent a memo to the staff making it clear the mandate going forward would be to enforce Trump’s executive orders targeting diversity programs.\n\n(A long, well written and researched article, very much worth clicking through)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNSF Indirect Cost Cap Unlawful, Judge Rules\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/24/federal-judge-vacates-nsf-indirect-cost-cap\n\nfederal judge tossed out the National Science Foundation’s policy capping reimbursements for costs indirectly related to research, finding “severe” deficiencies in the agency’s reasoning for the plan as well as “errors of law.”\n\n\nThe ruling from Judge Indira Talwani of the District of Massachusetts is the first final judgment against the 15 percent cap, which three other federal agencies have also sought to implement. Judges have temporarily blocked those caps, but in this lawsuit, the plaintiffs sought summary judgement, which allows the judge to reach a final decision without a trial.\n\n\nThirteen universities along with the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and the American Council on Education sued the NSF in May to block the cap, arguing the policy would cut funding to institutions and risk the country’s standing “as a world leader in scientific discovery.” The government’s lawyers said in court filings that the cap would have meant a cut of $432.3 million for colleges and universities in fiscal year 2024.\n\n\nTrump Administration Ousts National Science Foundation from Headquarters Building\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administration-ousts-national-science-foundation-from-headquarters/\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development is expected to announce Wednesday that it’s moving into the headquarters of the National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia, according to the union representing NSF employees.\n\n\nThe union, Soriano wrote, “understands that there is no planning except that the HUD secretary may take over the 18th and 19th floors” and start planning the HUD move over the next two years. “There is no planning for NSF, no identified future location, appropriation for a new building or a move,” he wrote.\n\n(A bluesky post lists HUD secretaries designs to take over the 19th floor for him; build out an executive dining room, reserve 5 personal parking spaces, have exclusive use of 1 elevator, have all assistants on the 18th floor)\nAlso\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/06/25/housing-hud-relocation/\n\nThe move will displace about 1,800 employees at the National Science Foundation, which has faced massive spending cuts under the Trump administration. Administration officials on Wednesday did not say where those NSF workers would end up, but Peters said the search for a new location would aim to minimize disruption to those employees’ lives and work.\n\n\nThe frustration added to broader discontent at HUD, the backbone of the federal government’s housing policy. Since Trump’s inauguration, the department has sought to slash funding for fair housing efforts, rental assistance, housing vouchers and homelessness prevention. So many staffers took the second-round buyout offer that officials are trying to get people to voluntarily move into vacant roles.\n\n\n“This callous disregard for taxpayer dollars and NSF employees comes after the Administration already cut NSF’s budget, staff and science grants and forced NSF employees back into the office,” the union said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump admin curtails colleges’ defense research\n\n[Politico Weekly Education email]\n\nFUNDING CUTS: The Department of Defense is shrinking research funding at various colleges and universities, a move that academics say curtails projects that keep U.S. troops safe.\n\n\nEarlier this month, the administration notified universities it would cut facility and administrative reimbursements to 15 percent for all DOD research grants focused on protecting military service members and strengthening national defense. These rates are negotiated between individual institutions and the government, but often fall between 50 percent and 65 percent.\n\n\nSeparate from the lawsuit, Cornell received 75 stop-work orders from DOD, which affected research pertaining to national defense, cybersecurity, and health.\n\nhttps://statements.cornell.edu/2025/20250408-federal-research-funding.cfm\n\n\n\n\nThe Education Department is paying us millions not to work\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/23/education-department-layoffs-doge-afge/\n\nNearly two million student loan borrowers are at risk of having their wages garnished this summer\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/student-loan-wage-garnishment-07fc4d2a?st=wKEnzN&reflink=article_gmail_share\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/financial-aid/2025/06/24/federal-cuts-could-lead-reduced-financial-aid-offers\n\n\n\n\n\nCongress Eyes Cap on Parent PLUS Loans\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/financial-aid/2025/06/25/advocates-say-parent-plus-caps-will-reduce-college-access\n\nBoth House and Senate Republicans want to cap how much parents can borrow via the Parent PLUS loan program, though they disagree about the amount. The House plan limits parents to $50,000 total, while the Senate plan would allow them to borrow up to $65,000 per dependent. Currently, the loans are uncapped, so parents can borrow as much as they need.\n\n\n(Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said at a recent hearing that about 34 percent of those with Parent PLUS loans borrow above the House’s proposed cap of $50,000.)\n\n\nThe proposed caps are just one of many cuts to student aid that Congress has included in recent proposals as part of the process known as reconciliation. The House version of the bill, which includes steeper cuts and restrictions across the board, passed in late May, while the Senate continues to finalize its proposal and is planning to vote on it as soon as this week. President Donald Trump has said he wants to sign what he’s dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by July 4.\n\n\nBut college-accessibility advocates have warned that the legislation will inevitably make college less affordable and loans more difficult to pay off for millions of Americans.\n\n\nTransUnion: 5M Borrowers Could Default by September\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/25/transunion-5m-borrowers-could-default-september\n\nThe TransUnion analysis found that as of April 2025, nearly one-third of borrowers were more than 90 days past due on their loans—a roughly 10-percentage-point jump compared to February 2025. Before the government paused payments in spring 2020 because of the pandemic, just 11.7 percent of borrowers fell into this category.\n\n\nBorrowers default when they are 270 days behind on their payments. TransUnion expects about 1.8 million borrowers to default in July, followed by another million in August and then another two million in September.\n\n\nThe Education Department resumed debt collections in May—the first time in more than three years that borrowers who defaulted on their loans faced the harshest consequences. Since that announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and other officials have worked to spread the word about the consequences of default and defended the restart as necessary to shore up the student loan system. They’ve encouraged borrowers to get in touch with their student loan servicer and urged colleges to get involved as well.\n\n\nThe Trump administration did plan to withhold some federal benefits such as tax returns and Social Security checks, but officials later backed off that part of that plan.\n\n\nBut so far, the department has held off on restarting its automatic wage garnishment system, in which they can dock up to 15 percent of a defaulted borrower’s paycheck. The agency plans to resume that system this summer.\n\n\nGraduate Programs Face a Federal Reckoning\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/graduate/2025/06/26/can-graduate-programs-survive-federal-loan-caps\n\nCongress wants to significantly cut back on federal loans for grad students. That could decimate the highly profitable graduate degree market—and limit who has access to it.\n\n\nThe Senate version of the reconciliation bill, which President Donald Trump has urged Congress to pass as early as next week, would cap professional degree loans at $200,000 and all other graduate loans at $100,000. Both the House and the Senate also proposed completely eliminating Grad PLUS, an unsubsidized federal loan with no borrowing limit that has helped students from modest backgrounds pay for graduate degrees since 2006.\n\n(This doesn’t seem to have an impact on CUNY students)\n\nEducation Department Outlines Plan to Change Debt-Relief Program for Public Servants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/06/26/education-department-outlines-plan-change-pslf-rules\n(This is a bit misplaced, but this would impact CUNY students)\n\nCritics worry that the changes could derail debt relief for borrowers and allow the administration to block funds from reaching public servants who work in fields or for employers that the president disagrees with.\n\n\n“The law does not empower the Secretary of Education to opine on the supposed illegality of a public service employer’s mission—an unprecedented exercise of executive power that extends far beyond the Higher Education Act,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, which shared a copy of the issue paper with Inside Higher Ed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Harvard and Trump Restart Talks to Potentially End Bitter Dispute\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/politics/harvard-federal-funding-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIt is unclear how close both sides are to a potential deal and the exact terms any final agreement would entail. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said it was “very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so.”\n\n\nHarvard has been widely praised by Democrats, academics, its alumni and democracy advocates for fighting the Trump administration. But top Harvard officials, according to two people briefed on the matter, have become increasingly convinced in recent weeks that the school has little choice but to try to strike a deal with the White House.\n\n\nThe Harvard officials believe that if the university remains at odds with the administration that it is likely to become far smaller and less ambitious as Mr. Trump tries to keep pummeling it with funding cuts, federal investigations and limits on visas for international students.\n\n\nIn exchange, Harvard would agree to take even more aggressive action than it already has to address issues such as antisemitism, race, and viewpoint diversity. The White House has pushed Harvard to make new commitments to change its admissions and hiring practices, one of the people close to the negotiations said.\n\n\nThe White House, according to one person briefed on the negotiations, hopes that an agreement with Harvard might serve as a framework for other elite colleges to strike deals with Mr. Trump. Other schools have been in discussions with the Trump administration about making deals that would keep their federal funding intact and avoid the president’s ire, two of the people said.\n\n\nAmong other conditions, the administration wanted Harvard to establish “merit based” hiring and admissions policies, and to see the influence of its faculty curbed. It sought a review for “viewpoint diversity,” the shutdown of any programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, and an outside review to examine “those programs and departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.”\n\n\nThe government also asked for Harvard to adjust its “recruitment, screening and admissions of international students,” audits of university data and reports “at least until the end of 2028” about the university’s compliance with the Trump administration’s conditions.\n\n\nUntil recently, though, Harvard’s top board resisted talks. The members directed the school’s battalion of lawyers, many of them fixtures of conservative legal circles, not to engage with the government.\n\n\nThe calculus has since shifted, in parallel with a handful of courtroom successes for Harvard and Mr. Trump’s public venting that the university had drawn a favorable judge.\n\n(Anyways, if Harvard bends it will be a gigantic blow to higher education. This article tries to narrow the “deal” to it impacting other top colleges, but this just opens the gates to asking for more and more and more, as the same threats can be reapplied by an administration that doesn’t honor past “deals”.)\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Live Updates: Federal Judge Blocks Efforts to Keep International Students Out of Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/20/us/trump-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nHarvard dispute: A federal judge on Friday froze the Trump administration’s effort to stop international students from enrolling at Harvard University.

Harvard’s relative prestige rises with the square of the distance from Cambridge, and so a global talent competition helps it. The greatest universities are drivers of progress. The 21st century will be a center of the life sciences, and because of Harvard, M.I.T. and their affiliates, Boston and Cambridge are ground zero, creating a flywheel effect with Stanford and digital technology. If anything, the trend is toward a higher fraction of government, business, artistic elites coming from elite schools as they get better at drawing talent.\n\n\nSummers: The trend could break if Trump stays super-destructive, courts are super-tolerant and the universities don’t adapt and settle. That is a real worry. My best guess, though, is that the need for universities as economic engines, the enforcement of law and the fact that there is low-hanging fruit for cultural correction in the universities will carry the day. I don’t think there is yet evidence of leading universities losing their appeal. Yes, there is a need to walk back from crazy, as there was after the 1960s. My guess is this will happen. You will see versions of Stanford’s Hoover Institution on many campuses, more emphasis on nonideological science and a big walk back on identity politics.\n\n\nBruni: Ross, it’s clear that Trump and his allies actually don’t want sweeping protections for free speech. They correctly called out intolerance on the left but are now replacing it with intolerance from the right. When you’re essentially banning any mention of D.E.I., detaining students for political viewpoints they’ve articulated, putting institutions on notice that you’ll punish them for any deviation from just-two-genders orthodoxy, well, Trump is swapping one cancel culture for another.

Bollinger, a former president of Columbia University and the University of Michigan, said that Harvard stood at a critical juncture in the history of American academia.\n\n\n“How you conduct yourself in these moments will say a lot over the future,” he said.\n\n\nHe warned that allowing the government a say in hiring was a perilous threat to “a core, core academic freedom principle.”\n\n\nMany around academia are wary of the White House’s record. …\n\n\nWith stakes high, White House pushes negotiations with Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/24/with-stakes-high-white-house-pushes-negotiations-with-harvard/\n\nThe Trump administration is ramping up negotiations with Harvard University in an effort to reach an end to its months-long battle with the elite school, two senior White House officials have said, as Harvard has been racking up legal wins in court.\n\n\nThe administration expects a deal to land by the end of the month, one official said, and hopes the agreement would make a big enough splash to “basically be a blueprint for the rest of higher education.” The White House officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\n\nHarvard declined to comment.\n\n\nHarvard allies, free-speech advocates and others have feared that the Trump administration would use its attacks on Harvard to exert control over universities nationwide and dismantle academic freedom. Whatever the outcome, the case will create a significant precedent, said higher education attorney Sarah Hartley.\n\n\n“This is the playbook to be used with other universities by the government going forward,” said Hartley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm BCLP. “It, in many ways, is being used as a test of democracy and what the government can force on private institutions.”\n\n\nThe government may have more motivation to come to a settlement outside of court than Harvard does, said higher education attorney Jodie Ferise, who believes Harvard has a stronger legal case.\n\n\n“The White House has every incentive to want to reach some kind of compromise, because I don’t think they’ll win this case,” she said.\n\n\n“The government cannot attempt a hostile takeover of any private institution, much less a private college or university, in order to impose its preferred vision of ideological balance,” the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in a brief filed with seven other organizations, including the right-leaning Cato Institute and Rutherford Institute.\n\n\nHarvard scientist accused of smuggling frog embryos faces new charges\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/26/harvard-researcher-frog-embryos-ice/\n\nIf convicted on the felony smuggling charge, Petrova could face up to 20 years in prison and be fined as much as $250,000. The new charges related to false statements are punishable by up to five years in prison and another $250,000 fine.\n\n\n\n\n\nHundreds of IU degree programs at risk of disappearing – WFIU/WTIU News\n\n(Thanks KB for sharing)\nhttps://wfiunews.wordpress.com/2025/06/24/hundreds-of-iu-degree-programs-at-risk-of-disappearing/\n\nIndiana University could lose hundreds of degree programs as part of compliance with an array of new laws affecting higher education that passed at the 11th hour of the legislative session. One of the laws requires public colleges and universities to eliminate programs with low numbers of degrees averaged over a three-year period. The cutoff is 15 graduates for a bachelor’s degree, seven for a master’s and three for a doctorate.\n\n\nSo far, most faculty don’t know what to expect. President-elect of the Bloomington Faculty Council Heather Akou said she hasn’t heard anything from the university but that it’s “aggressively” moving to get in line with the law. “There are going to be big changes for this university, and the pace at which this is being pushed through is not designed for positive outcomes,” she said. “I have to say that my faculty colleagues are in panic to a degree that I have never seen before.”\n\n\nMost of the degrees with low numbers of recipients are in the humanities and languages. Jewish Studies, Classical Studies and multiple language departments could lose their main offerings. From 2020 to 2022, IU Bloomington conferred more humanities doctorates than any other university in the country, according to data from Carnegie Classifications. It also ranks first for number of languages taught, for now.\n\n\n“Even tenured faculty are wondering, am I going to have a job in two months?” Akou said. “We’re scheduled to teach classes. Will I be allowed to teach the classes I’m scheduled to teach this fall? I don’t know. That’s really the level of chaos and confusion that’s going on right now.” The university declined an interview, but spokesperson Mark Bode wrote in an email that “IU is working with campus leaders to comply with the process mandated by state law.”\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Dept. says it is investigating Univ. of California hiring practices\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/26/university-california-trump-dei-investigation-hiring-justice/\n\nIn a letter to University of California President Michael Drake dated Thursday, the Justice Department claimed a strategic growth plan created by the UC system that mentions diversity in hiring suggests that the educational institution “may be engaged” in discriminatory employment practices based on race or sex.\n\n(May be the only people who take a strategic plan so seriously; ours is here https://www.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/about/chancellor/strategic-roadmap/CUNY_Lifting_New_York.pdf )\n\nThe antisemitism probe at the UC system is supposed to determine whether a “hostile work environment” has existed for Jewish employees on its campuses. The investigation announced Monday, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, will similarly seek to determine whether discrimination has existed in UC hiring.\n\n\n“It is important to note that we have not reached any conclusions about the subject matter of the investigation. We intend to consider all relevant information,” Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said in her letter to Drake.\n\n\nDhillon’s letter did not detail specific allegations of instances of hiring discrimination. She cited the University of California 2030 Capacity Plan as having “precipitated unlawful action,” specifically employment practices that may have discriminated against “employees, job applicants and training program participants based on race and sex.”\n\n\nIn its strategic plan, the University of California says it is “committed to increasing the diversity of its faculty, both underrepresented minorities and female faculty.” The plan discusses efforts to diversify the faculty so that campuses better reflect the population of California, a goal partially rooted in helping populations who are less likely to graduate from college earn degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Budget Cuts and a Loss of Trust Threaten Higher Ed’s Workforce\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/career-development/2025/06/23/budget-cuts-loss-trust-threaten-higher-eds\n\nThe consequences of the sector’s financial instability and ongoing government attacks include anxiety among faculty and staff feeling the strain of hiring freezes, uncertainty about internal grant opportunities and even questions about having enough staff on hand to continue delivering basic services, said Kevin McClure, a professor of higher education and chair of the Department of Educational Leadership at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.\n\n\nHe added that leaders who have compromised their institutional values in response to political pressure have eroded the trust of their campus communities.\n\n\nFIU Donor Pulls Funds Over President’s Politics\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/26/fiu-donor-pulls-funds-over-presidents-politics\n\nA Miami businessman has walked back a $1 million donation to Florida International University after lawmakers repealed in-state tuition for undocumented students, The Miami Herald reported.\n\n\n\n\n\nNSF Grant Terminations 2025\n\nhttps://grant-watch.us/\n\nGrant Watch is a project to track the termination of grants of scientific research agencies under the Trump administration in 2025.

    "text": "The Republican Plot to Un-Educate America | The New Republic\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/197017/budget-bill-kill-higher-education\n\nTrump’s “big, beautiful bill” is an extinction-level event for higher education that would annihilate the country’s intellectual potential.\n\n\nFor colleges and universities, the potential fallout is hard to overstate. Whatever schools survive are likely to be drained of working- and middle-class families, instead populated only by society’s most wealthy. As it is, millions of people rightly consider universities to be a costly endeavor that is irrelevant to their everyday life. But rather than remaking higher ed into a vibrant and more democratic institution, this bill threatens to do the opposite. It will cement the stereotype of higher education as an elite institution into an ironclad reality. On June 25, student debtors and their allies will be protesting these devastating cuts in Washington, D.C. But so far, very few elected officials are sounding the alarm on these issues with the fever pitch they deserve, let alone doing the work required to slow down and obstruct their passage into law.\n\n\nIn the words of influential conservative activist Christopher Rufo, “Reforming the student loan programs could put the whole university sector into a significant recession” and state of “existential terror.” The goal is to use economic policy to impose an unpopular and stifling ideological agenda, exacted by punitive student debt.\n\n\nThese cuts won’t just harm students who rely on loans to afford college; they will take the doors off colleges’ and universities’ capacity to expand minds and redistribute opportunity. Lost revenue will encourage schools to close programs, squeeze staff, and perhaps shutter entirely. A proposed endowment tax for colleges and universities has prompted fury among higher education lobbyists, but those players have said very little about the bill’s vigorous imposition of debt as a tool of social control.\n\n\nContemporary Republicans are even more brazen. Consider a recent report released by the Heritage Foundation that recommends terminating higher education “subsidies” and student loan cancellation in order to “increase the married birthrate.” What does this goulash mean in plain English?",

Then Came Trump.\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/academic-freedom/2025/06/23/academic-freedom-service-academies-dissipates-under\n(Thanks BE for sharing)\n\nOfficials are restricting education about diversity and criticism of the U.S. It’s an erosion of rights within the institutions training America’s future military officers.\n\n\nA week into his second presidential term, Donald Trump issued an executive order banning service academies under the Defense Department—the U.S Military Academy at West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Air Force Academy—from “promoting, advancing, or otherwise inculcating the following un-American, divisive, discriminatory, radical, extremist, and irrational theories.” The theories listed were “divisive concepts,” “gender ideology,” race or sex “stereotyping” and “scapegoating,” and the idea “that America’s founding documents are racist or sexist.”\n\n\nThe Times also reported that Christopher Barth, West Point’s senior librarian, is resigning after 14 years amid demands that he identify books that might violate Hegseth’s order. West Point didn’t answer most questions that Inside Higher Ed posed to it, including whether books have actually been removed.\n\n\nAt the Naval Academy, Tom McCarthy resigned from his role as history department chair this month, The Baltimore Sun reported. The Naval Academy confirmed his resignation letter to Inside Higher Ed.\n\n\n‘A Banner Year for Censorship’: More States Are Restricting Classroom Discussions on Race and Gender\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/a-banner-year-for-censorship-more-states-are-restricting-classroom-discussions-on-race-and-gender\n\nTeaching social work in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Cassandra E. Simon often assigns readings that describe how the families her students might one day serve have been impacted by more than a century of housing, employment, and education discrimination. The associate professor has encouraged her students to engage in spirited discussions about race, even assigning a project in which they advocate for or against a social-justice issue.\n\n\nDoing any of those things today, she argues in a federal lawsuit, could get her fired from the state flagship, where she’s taught for 25 years. Last year, the state’s Republican governor, Kay Ivey, signed into law a sweeping bill that restricts what professors can teach about race. If any of their lessons veer into what conservative politicians have deemed “divisive concepts,” faculty members risk being reported, investigated, and potentially fired.\n\n\nBut over the past two years, more than a dozen laws have been enacted that either limit which classes can be taught or imposed restrictions on what professors can say in the classroom, according to a Chronicle analysis of state legislation and a compilation of what PEN America calls “educational gag orders.”\n\n\nThis year especially “has been a banner year for censorship at a state level across the country,” said Amy B. Reid, senior manager at PEN America’s Freedom to Learn program. “The point of a lot of these restrictions is to put people on guard, worried that anything or everything could be prohibited so you really have to watch what you say.”",

    "text": "Texas looks to enact restrictions on when and how students can protest\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/20/texas-campus-speech-law-palestine-protests/\n\nSenate Bill 2972 prohibits protesting between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m., or during the last two weeks of the semester; and bans students from camping or erecting tents on campus, or wearing a disguise to conceal their identity. It also bars the use of microphones and drums.\n\n\nRepublicans in Texas say the proposal will prevent campus disruption and intimidation seen during last year’s pro-Palestinian protests. But critics across the political spectrum, such as the free speech advocacy group Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, say the proposal is too broad and threatens all forms of expressive activity.\n\n\n“Wearing a MAGA hat or a Bernie [Sanders] T-shirt would be prohibited between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. because the political apparel is an expressive act, and therefore covered as an expressive activity,” said Tyler Coward, FIRE’s lead counsel for government affairs.\n\n\nUnder the proposed law, universities could bar a guest speaker from campus if school officials believe there will be a large protest, Coward said.\n\n\nTexas Governor Signs Bill to Limit Expressive Activity on Campuses\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/free-speech/2025/06/23/texas-passes-bill-limiting-expressive-activity-campus\n\nTexas governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial bill that would restrict expressive activities on college campuses, reversing some of the rights afforded by a 2019 bill intended to protect Texans’ ability to protest on campuses.\n\n\nTexas Governor Signs Law Giving Presidents Control of Faculty Senates\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/24/texas-passes-law-presidents-control-faculty-senates\n(These were highlighted in an earlier digest, but worth repeating…)\n\nSenate Bill 37 says that only an institution’s governing board can create a faculty council or senate. If a board decides to keep one, the college or university president gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary” and prescribe how the body conducts meetings.\n\n\nUnless the institution’s board decides otherwise, faculty governing bodies must shrink to no more than 60 members. The Texas A&M University Faculty Senate currently has 122.\n\n\nThe 60 members must include at least two representatives from each of the colleges and schools that comprise the institution—including what the law describes vaguely as “one member appointed by the president or chief executive officer of the institution,” with the rest elected by the faculty of the particular school or college. This could mean that half of a faculty senate would be chosen by the president, barring an exemption by the institution’s board.\n\n\nSB 37 also says an institution’s provost can recommend to the president that members be “immediately removed” for failing to attend meetings or not conducting their “responsibilities within the council’s or senate’s parameters,” or for “similar misconduct.”\n\n\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Says He Wants to Fund More Trade Schools.

It also created a new point of contention in President Trump’s efforts to cut costs by dismantling elements of the social safety net. As Congress debates a budget bill that would reduce funding for federal anti-poverty programs such as Medicaid and food benefits, the White House is also proposing that the Job Corps, with its nearly $1.8 billion budget, be eliminated.\n\n\nTrump DEI Purge Made Black Women in Federal Jobs an “Easy Target” — ProPublica\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/trump-dei-black-women-minorities-careers-jobs-dismissed\n\nHer experience is part of a largely untold story unfolding as Trump dismantles civil rights and inclusion programs across government: Many of those being forced out, like Crowner, are Black women who spent decades building a career of government service, only to see those careers shattered in a sudden purge.\n\n\nNYTimes: How Trump Treats Black History Differently Than Other Parts of America’s Past\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/politics/trump-black-history-federal-holidays.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nChad Williams, a historian and professor of African American and Black diaspora studies at Boston University, said Mr. Trump’s actions, taken as a whole, showed that the administration was seeking to craft a “propaganda version of history.”\n\n\n“They’re trying to erase the history of Black struggle and Black resistance by denying the realities of racism and white supremacy,” Mr. Williams said. “They’re crafting a history that romanticizes the past at the expense of a true telling of the complexities and nuances of the American experience.”\n\n\nHBCUs Reel as Trump Cuts Black-Focused Grants: ‘This Is Our Existence’\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/hbcus-reel-as-trump-cuts-black-focused-grants-this-is-our-existence\n\nIn less than three years, Quick [Tennessee State University’s Quincy Quick] helped raise $100 million in research grants, launch an AI research center, and bring Tennessee State significantly closer to becoming the second historically Black college and university to receive Research I status. But many of those grants focused on serving Black students and Black communities, a core part of the land-grant institution’s mission.\n\n\nAs the VPs fretted over how they would retain vital research grants, one administrator quipped, “HBCUs won’t be affected because they don’t look at HBCUs as DEI.”\n\n\nQuick, the only HBCU administrator in attendance, recalled thinking, “That’s ridiculous, and it’s absolutely naïve. We absolutely would get hit. … And that’s exactly what has happened.”\n\n\nIn total, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation have canceled more than $140 million in grants at HBCUs since March, according to a Chronicle analysis of two databases tracking grant cancellations.\n\n\nThe NIH in March said that plans to enhance diversity are no longer required in training-grant applications, and “those included in applications under review will not be evaluated or considered in funding decisions.”\n\n\nThe NSF said in April that research supported by the federal government must “aim to create opportunities for all Americans everywhere.” Federally supported research on protected groups must be open to all nonprotected groups.\n\n\nThe agency has not provided guidance on what initiatives are considered DEI.\n\n\nNYTimes: Trump Justice Dept.

Dhillon, the Justice Department’s top civil rights lawyer, has also been involved in negotiations with the university.\n\n\nBefore becoming the University of Virginia’s president, Mr. Ryan served as the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he was praised for his commitment to D.E.I. programs.\n\n\nThe administration’s attempt to assert federal influence over state university leadership decisions is also illustrative of how Mr. Trump’s political appointees continue to wield the Justice Department’s investigative powers to achieve policy goals long sought by a top Trump adviser, Stephen Miller.\n\n\nBut Mr. Ryan has been singled out by the Trump administration as his steps toward compliance have been criticized by conservative groups as insufficient. America First Legal, a nonprofit started by Mr. Miller, last month accused the University of Virginia of paying lip service to Mr. Trump’s orders by simply running the same diversity programs under a different name. The group issued a news release last month that called on the Justice Department to “hold UVA accountable.”\n\n(also here)\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/tracking-trumps-higher-ed-agenda\n\nNYTimes: How Trump Upended 60 Years of Civil Rights in Two Months\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/27/magazine/trump-civil-rights-law-discrimination.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLast year, a little-known office in the U.S. Department of Labor helped Black workers at a Texas medical center recover $900,000 in back wages, and Black workers at a Caterpillar manufacturing plant in Illinois recover $800,000, each time over allegations that those applicants lost out on jobs because of their race. Called the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, this division investigates and fights employment discrimination for one-fifth of the U.S. labor force. It was created in 1965 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an executive order strengthening the provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that banned racial discrimination by employers.\n\n\nOn his second day in office, President Donald Trump labeled O.F.C.C.P.’s efforts to enforce the 1964 Civil Rights Act illegal and discriminatory — presumably against white people. He signed his own executive order revoking Johnson’s on behalf of, as he put it, “hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American dream.”\n\n\nYet in the opening months of his second term, Trump has capitalized on the unpopularity of equality efforts among some Americans, glibly wielding the language of D.E.I. to initiate the broadest and most significant assault on civil rights and racial integration in this country in more than a century.\n\n\nConservatives have spent decades chipping away both at civil rights protections and the national will to address racial inequality. Since the racial reckoning of 2020, Republicans have toppled affirmative action in college admissions and waged an enormously successful campaign to make the language of equity and inclusion anathema, to label books and lessons about the nation’s history “anti-white” and “divisive” and to prohibit everything from Black studies to university diversity offices. And earlier this month, the Supreme Court, which over the years has made it increasingly challenging for Black Americans to prove discrimination, has now made it easier for straight white people to do so.\n\n\nThe Education Department sent a letter to all educational institutions receiving federal funds asserting without evidence that they were engaging in “pervasive and repugnant race-based” discrimination against white and Asian students. Federal data shows that Black students are disproportionately concentrated in schools with fewer resources and less funding, and experience significant academic disparities. And yet the letter told public schools and universities that they had 14 days to purge all diversity and equity efforts — which include programs that try to help diversify teaching staffs and help Black students close the achievement gaps they suffer from nationwide — or lose access to federal funds.\n\n\nBut probably the starkest change is the redirecting of the Department of Justice away from fighting anti-Black discrimination and toward eliminating integration efforts. Harmeet Dhillon, the new head of the department’s Civil Rights Division, sent a memo to the staff making it clear the mandate going forward would be to enforce Trump’s executive orders targeting diversity programs.\n\n(A long, well written and researched article, very much worth clicking through)",

Judges have temporarily blocked those caps, but in this lawsuit, the plaintiffs sought summary judgement, which allows the judge to reach a final decision without a trial.\n\n\nThirteen universities along with the Association of American Universities, the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and the American Council on Education sued the NSF in May to block the cap, arguing the policy would cut funding to institutions and risk the country’s standing “as a world leader in scientific discovery.” The government’s lawyers said in court filings that the cap would have meant a cut of $432.3 million for colleges and universities in fiscal year 2024.\n\n\nTrump Administration Ousts National Science Foundation from Headquarters Building\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administration-ousts-national-science-foundation-from-headquarters/\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development is expected to announce Wednesday that it’s moving into the headquarters of the National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia, according to the union representing NSF employees.\n\n\nThe union, Soriano wrote, “understands that there is no planning except that the HUD secretary may take over the 18th and 19th floors” and start planning the HUD move over the next two years. “There is no planning for NSF, no identified future location, appropriation for a new building or a move,” he wrote.\n\n(A bluesky post lists HUD secretaries designs to take over the 19th floor for him; build out an executive dining room, reserve 5 personal parking spaces, have exclusive use of 1 elevator, have all assistants on the 18th floor)\nAlso\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/06/25/housing-hud-relocation/\n\nThe move will displace about 1,800 employees at the National Science Foundation, which has faced massive spending cuts under the Trump administration. Administration officials on Wednesday did not say where those NSF workers would end up, but Peters said the search for a new location would aim to minimize disruption to those employees’ lives and work.\n\n\nThe frustration added to broader discontent at HUD, the backbone of the federal government’s housing policy. Since Trump’s inauguration, the department has sought to slash funding for fair housing efforts, rental assistance, housing vouchers and homelessness prevention. So many staffers took the second-round buyout offer that officials are trying to get people to voluntarily move into vacant roles.\n\n\n“This callous disregard for taxpayer dollars and NSF employees comes after the Administration already cut NSF’s budget, staff and science grants and forced NSF employees back into the office,” the union said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump admin curtails colleges’ defense research\n\n[Politico Weekly Education email]\n\nFUNDING CUTS: The Department of Defense is shrinking research funding at various colleges and universities, a move that academics say curtails projects that keep U.S. troops safe.\n\n\nEarlier this month, the administration notified universities it would cut facility and administrative reimbursements to 15 percent for all DOD research grants focused on protecting military service members and strengthening national defense. These rates are negotiated between individual institutions and the government, but often fall between 50 percent and 65 percent.\n\n\nSeparate from the lawsuit, Cornell received 75 stop-work orders from DOD, which affected research pertaining to national defense, cybersecurity, and health.\n\nhttps://statements.cornell.edu/2025/20250408-federal-research-funding.cfm\n\n\n\n\nThe Education Department is paying us millions not to work\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/23/education-department-layoffs-doge-afge/\n\nNearly two million student loan borrowers are at risk of having their wages garnished this summer\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/student-loan-wage-garnishment-07fc4d2a?st=wKEnzN&reflink=article_gmail_share\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/financial-aid/2025/06/24/federal-cuts-could-lead-reduced-financial-aid-offers",

    "text": "Congress Eyes Cap on Parent PLUS Loans\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/financial-aid/2025/06/25/advocates-say-parent-plus-caps-will-reduce-college-access\n\nBoth House and Senate Republicans want to cap how much parents can borrow via the Parent PLUS loan program, though they disagree about the amount. The House plan limits parents to $50,000 total, while the Senate plan would allow them to borrow up to $65,000 per dependent. Currently, the loans are uncapped, so parents can borrow as much as they need.\n\n\n(Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said at a recent hearing that about 34 percent of those with Parent PLUS loans borrow above the House’s proposed cap of $50,000.)\n\n\nThe proposed caps are just one of many cuts to student aid that Congress has included in recent proposals as part of the process known as reconciliation. The House version of the bill, which includes steeper cuts and restrictions across the board, passed in late May, while the Senate continues to finalize its proposal and is planning to vote on it as soon as this week. President Donald Trump has said he wants to sign what he’s dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by July 4.\n\n\nBut college-accessibility advocates have warned that the legislation will inevitably make college less affordable and loans more difficult to pay off for millions of Americans.\n\n\nTransUnion: 5M Borrowers Could Default by September\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/06/25/transunion-5m-borrowers-could-default-september\n\nThe TransUnion analysis found that as of April 2025, nearly one-third of borrowers were more than 90 days past due on their loans—a roughly 10-percentage-point jump compared to February 2025. Before the government paused payments in spring 2020 because of the pandemic, just 11.7 percent of borrowers fell into this category.\n\n\nBorrowers default when they are 270 days behind on their payments. TransUnion expects about 1.8 million borrowers to default in July, followed by another million in August and then another two million in September.\n\n\nThe Education Department resumed debt collections in May—the first time in more than three years that borrowers who defaulted on their loans faced the harshest consequences. Since that announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and other officials have worked to spread the word about the consequences of default and defended the restart as necessary to shore up the student loan system. They’ve encouraged borrowers to get in touch with their student loan servicer and urged colleges to get involved as well.\n\n\nThe Trump administration did plan to withhold some federal benefits such as tax returns and Social Security checks, but officials later backed off that part of that plan.\n\n\nBut so far, the department has held off on restarting its automatic wage garnishment system, in which they can dock up to 15 percent of a defaulted borrower’s paycheck. The agency plans to resume that system this summer.\n\n\nGraduate Programs Face a Federal Reckoning\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/graduate/2025/06/26/can-graduate-programs-survive-federal-loan-caps\n\nCongress wants to significantly cut back on federal loans for grad students. That could decimate the highly profitable graduate degree market—and limit who has access to it.\n\n\nThe Senate version of the reconciliation bill, which President Donald Trump has urged Congress to pass as early as next week, would cap professional degree loans at $200,000 and all other graduate loans at $100,000. Both the House and the Senate also proposed completely eliminating Grad PLUS, an unsubsidized federal loan with no borrowing limit that has helped students from modest backgrounds pay for graduate degrees since 2006.\n\n(This doesn’t seem to have an impact on CUNY students)\n\nEducation Department Outlines Plan to Change Debt-Relief Program for Public Servants\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/student-aid-policy/2025/06/26/education-department-outlines-plan-change-pslf-rules\n(This is a bit misplaced, but this would impact CUNY students)\n\nCritics worry that the changes could derail debt relief for borrowers and allow the administration to block funds from reaching public servants who work in fields or for employers that the president disagrees with.\n\n\n“The law does not empower the Secretary of Education to opine on the supposed illegality of a public service employer’s mission—an unprecedented exercise of executive power that extends far beyond the Higher Education Act,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, which shared a copy of the issue paper with Inside Higher Ed.",

    "text": "NYTimes: Harvard and Trump Restart Talks to Potentially End Bitter Dispute\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/us/politics/harvard-federal-funding-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nIt is unclear how close both sides are to a potential deal and the exact terms any final agreement would entail. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said it was “very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so.”\n\n\nHarvard has been widely praised by Democrats, academics, its alumni and democracy advocates for fighting the Trump administration. But top Harvard officials, according to two people briefed on the matter, have become increasingly convinced in recent weeks that the school has little choice but to try to strike a deal with the White House.\n\n\nThe Harvard officials believe that if the university remains at odds with the administration that it is likely to become far smaller and less ambitious as Mr. Trump tries to keep pummeling it with funding cuts, federal investigations and limits on visas for international students.\n\n\nIn exchange, Harvard would agree to take even more aggressive action than it already has to address issues such as antisemitism, race, and viewpoint diversity. The White House has pushed Harvard to make new commitments to change its admissions and hiring practices, one of the people close to the negotiations said.\n\n\nThe White House, according to one person briefed on the negotiations, hopes that an agreement with Harvard might serve as a framework for other elite colleges to strike deals with Mr. Trump. Other schools have been in discussions with the Trump administration about making deals that would keep their federal funding intact and avoid the president’s ire, two of the people said.\n\n\nAmong other conditions, the administration wanted Harvard to establish “merit based” hiring and admissions policies, and to see the influence of its faculty curbed. It sought a review for “viewpoint diversity,” the shutdown of any programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, and an outside review to examine “those programs and departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.”\n\n\nThe government also asked for Harvard to adjust its “recruitment, screening and admissions of international students,” audits of university data and reports “at least until the end of 2028” about the university’s compliance with the Trump administration’s conditions.\n\n\nUntil recently, though, Harvard’s top board resisted talks. The members directed the school’s battalion of lawyers, many of them fixtures of conservative legal circles, not to engage with the government.\n\n\nThe calculus has since shifted, in parallel with a handful of courtroom successes for Harvard and Mr. Trump’s public venting that the university had drawn a favorable judge.\n\n(Anyways, if Harvard bends it will be a gigantic blow to higher education. This article tries to narrow the “deal” to it impacting other top colleges, but this just opens the gates to asking for more and more and more, as the same threats can be reapplied by an administration that doesn’t honor past “deals”.)\n\nNYTimes: Trump Administration Live Updates: Federal Judge Blocks Efforts to Keep International Students Out of Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/20/us/trump-news?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nHarvard dispute: A federal judge on Friday froze the Trump administration’s effort to stop international students from enrolling at Harvard University. The preliminary injunction, from a federal court in Boston, allows about 7,000 Harvard students and recent graduates to continue to study and work legally in the United States.

It does not address President Donald Trump’s executive proclamation from earlier this month banning the State Department from issuing visas to international students and researchers attending Harvard; a temporary restriction on that ban expired June 20.\n\n\nNYTimes: ‘Are We Past Peak Harvard?’: 3 Writers Mull Higher Education’s Woes\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/opinion/trump-higher-education-harvard.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nLarry Summers: Maybe, but there are countervailing forces. Harvard’s relative prestige rises with the square of the distance from Cambridge, and so a global talent competition helps it. The greatest universities are drivers of progress. The 21st century will be a center of the life sciences, and because of Harvard, M.I.T. and their affiliates, Boston and Cambridge are ground zero, creating a flywheel effect with Stanford and digital technology. If anything, the trend is toward a higher fraction of government, business, artistic elites coming from elite schools as they get better at drawing talent.\n\n\nSummers: The trend could break if Trump stays super-destructive, courts are super-tolerant and the universities don’t adapt and settle. That is a real worry. My best guess, though, is that the need for universities as economic engines, the enforcement of law and the fact that there is low-hanging fruit for cultural correction in the universities will carry the day. I don’t think there is yet evidence of leading universities losing their appeal. Yes, there is a need to walk back from crazy, as there was after the 1960s. My guess is this will happen. You will see versions of Stanford’s Hoover Institution on many campuses, more emphasis on nonideological science and a big walk back on identity politics.\n\n\nBruni: Ross, it’s clear that Trump and his allies actually don’t want sweeping protections for free speech. They correctly called out intolerance on the left but are now replacing it with intolerance from the right. When you’re essentially banning any mention of D.E.I., detaining students for political viewpoints they’ve articulated, putting institutions on notice that you’ll punish them for any deviation from just-two-genders orthodoxy, well, Trump is swapping one cancel culture for another. No?\n\n(But there is no convincing Ross Douthat and Larry Summers carries around grudges about faculty for who knows when)\n\nNYTimes: Here Is All the Science at Risk in Trump’s Clash With Harvard\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/22/upshot/harvard-funding-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe federal government annually spends billions funding research at Harvard, part of a decades-old system that is little understood by the public but essential to American science.\n\n\nThis spring, nearly every dollar of that payment was cut off by the Trump administration, endangering much of the university’s research.\n\n\nThe New York Times was able to identify more than 900 terminated grants, using court records, government databases and other internal university sources — a near-complete accounting of the cuts in the Trump administration’s escalating campaign to cripple the university.\n\n(Accompanying infographic is top notch)\n\nHarvard flouted the rules. Now, it’s getting a hard lesson. (Kristi Noem can write…)\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/23/kristi-noem-harvard-foreign-students-dhs-restriction/\n\nI remain prepared to revoke Harvard University’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which allows the university to admit foreign students, because school leadership has not complied with the Department of Homeland Security’s lawful oversight duties, has fostered antisemitic extremism and used taxpayer money to collaborate with an American adversary.\n\n(I’d quote more, but my keyboard might melt)\n\nNYTimes: Judge Blocks Trump Proclamation Barring Harvard’s International Students\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/us/harvard-trump-international-students.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nNYTimes: Behind Closed Doors, Harvard Officials Debate a Risky Truce With Trump\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/24/us/politics/harvard-debate-settlement-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nHarvard University, battered by a devastating conflict with the Trump administration that has jeopardized its elite standing, is facing a problem as it weighs a possible truce with President Trump: how to strike a deal without compromising its values or appearing to have capitulated.\n\n\nUnlike many other powerful institutions that have struck bargains with Mr. Trump, Harvard, the nation’s oldest and richest university, spent much of this spring as the vanguard of resistance to the White House, credited by academic leaders, alumni and pro-democracy activists for fighting the administration and serving as a formidable barrier against authoritarianism.\n\n\nDespite a series of legal wins against the administration, though, Harvard officials concluded in recent weeks that those victories alone might be insufficient to protect the university.\n\n\nLee C. Bollinger, a former president of Columbia University and the University of Michigan, said that Harvard stood at a critical juncture in the history of American academia.\n\n\n“How you conduct yourself in these moments will say a lot over the future,” he said.\n\n\nHe warned that allowing the government a say in hiring was a perilous threat to “a core, core academic freedom principle.”\n\n\nMany around academia are wary of the White House’s record. …\n\n\nWith stakes high, White House pushes negotiations with Harvard\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/24/with-stakes-high-white-house-pushes-negotiations-with-harvard/\n\nThe Trump administration is ramping up negotiations with Harvard University in an effort to reach an end to its months-long battle with the elite school, two senior White House officials have said, as Harvard has been racking up legal wins in court.\n\n\nThe administration expects a deal to land by the end of the month, one official said, and hopes the agreement would make a big enough splash to “basically be a blueprint for the rest of higher education.” The White House officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\n\n\nHarvard declined to comment.\n\n\nHarvard allies, free-speech advocates and others have feared that the Trump administration would use its attacks on Harvard to exert control over universities nationwide and dismantle academic freedom. Whatever the outcome, the case will create a significant precedent, said higher education attorney Sarah Hartley.\n\n\n“This is the playbook to be used with other universities by the government going forward,” said Hartley, a partner at the Washington-based law firm BCLP. “It, in many ways, is being used as a test of democracy and what the government can force on private institutions.”\n\n\nThe government may have more motivation to come to a settlement outside of court than Harvard does, said higher education attorney Jodie Ferise, who believes Harvard has a stronger legal case.\n\n\n“The White House has every incentive to want to reach some kind of compromise, because I don’t think they’ll win this case,” she said.\n\n\n“The government cannot attempt a hostile takeover of any private institution, much less a private college or university, in order to impose its preferred vision of ideological balance,” the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in a brief filed with seven other organizations, including the right-leaning Cato Institute and Rutherford Institute.\n\n\nHarvard scientist accused of smuggling frog embryos faces new charges\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/26/harvard-researcher-frog-embryos-ice/\n\nIf convicted on the felony smuggling charge, Petrova could face up to 20 years in prison and be fined as much as $250,000. The new charges related to false statements are punishable by up to five years in prison and another $250,000 fine.\n\n\n\n\n\nHundreds of IU degree programs at risk of disappearing – WFIU/WTIU News\n\n(Thanks KB for sharing)\nhttps://wfiunews.wordpress.com/2025/06/24/hundreds-of-iu-degree-programs-at-risk-of-disappearing/\n\nIndiana University could lose hundreds of degree programs as part of compliance with an array of new laws affecting higher education that passed at the 11th hour of the legislative session. One of the laws requires public colleges and universities to eliminate programs with low numbers of degrees averaged over a three-year period. The cutoff is 15 graduates for a bachelor’s degree, seven for a master’s and three for a doctorate.\n\n\nSo far, most faculty don’t know what to expect. President-elect of the Bloomington Faculty Council Heather Akou said she hasn’t heard anything from the university but that it’s “aggressively” moving to get in line with the law. “There are going to be big changes for this university, and the pace at which this is being pushed through is not designed for positive outcomes,” she said. “I have to say that my faculty colleagues are in panic to a degree that I have never seen before.”\n\n\nMost of the degrees with low numbers of recipients are in the humanities and languages. Jewish Studies, Classical Studies and multiple language departments could lose their main offerings. From 2020 to 2022, IU Bloomington conferred more humanities doctorates than any other university in the country, according to data from Carnegie Classifications. It also ranks first for number of languages taught, for now.\n\n\n“Even tenured faculty are wondering, am I going to have a job in two months?” Akou said. “We’re scheduled to teach classes. Will I be allowed to teach the classes I’m scheduled to teach this fall? I don’t know. That’s really the level of chaos and confusion that’s going on right now.” The university declined an interview, but spokesperson Mark Bode wrote in an email that “IU is working with campus leaders to comply with the process mandated by state law.”\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Dept. says it is investigating Univ. of California hiring practices\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/06/26/university-california-trump-dei-investigation-hiring-justice/\n\nIn a letter to University of California President Michael Drake dated Thursday, the Justice Department claimed a strategic growth plan created by the UC system that mentions diversity in hiring suggests that the educational institution “may be engaged” in discriminatory employment practices based on race or sex.\n\n(May be the only people who take a strategic plan so seriously; ours is here https://www.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/about/chancellor/strategic-roadmap/CUNY_Lifting_New_York.pdf )\n\nThe antisemitism probe at the UC system is supposed to determine whether a “hostile work environment” has existed for Jewish employees on its campuses. The investigation announced Monday, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, will similarly seek to determine whether discrimination has existed in UC hiring.\n\n\n“It is important to note that we have not reached any conclusions about the subject matter of the investigation. We intend to consider all relevant information,” Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said in her letter to Drake.\n\n\nDhillon’s letter did not detail specific allegations of instances of hiring discrimination. She cited the University of California 2030 Capacity Plan as having “precipitated unlawful action,” specifically employment practices that may have discriminated against “employees, job applicants and training program participants based on race and sex.”\n\n\nIn its strategic plan, the University of California says it is “committed to increasing the diversity of its faculty, both underrepresented minorities and female faculty.” The plan discusses efforts to diversify the faculty so that campuses better reflect the population of California, a goal partially rooted in helping populations who are less likely to graduate from college earn degrees.",

    "text": "Dear All,\nPlease find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week. Sadly another terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week. More tricks (re) employed: monkeying with grants; tax-exempt status; accreditation; student visas; and a Draconian proposed budget. Atleast it seems clear – resistance is the only means forward.\n\n\n\nSeveral CUNY senates have passed alliance resolutions\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/my5g55jprx5o64r4vzus0/ABqQBAimqk_KN5t-EsUG8Ds/1.Mutual%20Defense%20Statements?dl=0&rlkey=zvsqtp7ev781y4rqqjti8xaho&subfolder_nav_tracking=1\nThese include BMCC, CCNY, Hostos, Hunter, QBCC, and the UFS XC. (Apologies if any are not included)\n\nPSC, UUP, and NYSUT (representing public higher education in NY State) speak out in a press statement\n\nhttps://psc-cuny.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/State-Ed-leaders-call-on-Chancellors-challenge-Trump-administration-attacks-on-the-public-higher-education-systems.pdf\n\nWe Must Leverage the Strength of Our Institutions and Stand Together\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/we-must-leverage-the-strength/home\n\nDear Presidents, Chancellors, and Boards of Trustees of the 60 Universities that received a March 10th warning letter from the U.S. Department of Education:\n\n\nYou are on the frontlines of a war that is unfolding against U.S. higher education. We look to you for leadership and coalition-building during a time when the stakes have never been higher.\n\n\nWe ask all sixty institutions under government threat to unite in a coordinated, proactive defense.\n\n(~3009 signatories)\n\nAdvocating for Brown – What’s at stake | Office of the President | Brown University\n\nhttps://president.brown.edu/president/advocating-brown-whats-stake\n\nIt’s important to share what is at stake for Brown. The research funding cuts that Brown has already suffered are causing immediate harm, forcing us to reconfigure our operations and budget to address funding shortfalls. Any long-term cuts of significant magnitude would imperil, or possibly end, several areas of high-impact research at Brown. This would be devastating to Brown’s research community, including the undergraduate, graduate and medical students we teach, and the people, patients and communities that benefit from the results of our research.\n\n\nEven more concerning, since early April, Brown has not been reimbursed for any expenses associated with active (i.e., not terminated) grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), whose grants make up roughly 70% of Brown’s overall research portfolio. Again, we have not been given any official explanation for why expenses for active grants are not being reimbursed.

When Mr. Trump began threatening the university with canceled funds this spring, many Harvard professors and students urged administrators to head straight to the ramparts and denounce him. Alan Garber, Harvard’s president, took a wiser approach. He acknowledged that some of Mr. Trump’s criticisms had merit. Harvard, like much of elite higher education, has, in fact, been blasé about antisemitism, and it has too often prioritized progressive ideology over an independent search for truth.\n\n\nBy admitting as much, Mr. Garber strengthened Harvard’s political position. He said what many Americans believed. But when the administration issued a list of ludicrous demands, Harvard fought back hard. It filed a lawsuit, with help from a legal team that included conservative litigators, and became a national symbol of resistance to his lawlessness. Mr. Garber made Harvard look reasonable and Mr. Trump unreasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Road Map of Trump’s Lawless Presidency, According to 35 Legal Scholars\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/opinion/trump-constitution-rule-of-law.html?unlocked_article_code=1.DE8.cUMD.AE-5Mjxg6jlf&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe disregard for law is itself part of the agenda.

You need to trace its roots in the 1960s, its evolution through the culture wars of the 1980s and ’90s, and into the current populist fray. Then you need to do something about it. Professors, administrators, students, and concerned citizens can no longer stand on the sidelines, shaking our heads and deploring the potentially devastating consequences. The simple truth is this: For decades, outside forces have — both consciously and unintentionally — undermined the integrity and quality of public higher education in America. And time and time again, a divided academic community has failed to combat them effectively. We can and must do better. Seeds of resistance are sprouting. Together, we must nurture their growth.

With labs, dormitories, lecture halls, athletic facilities, and so much else, colleges have exorbitant fixed costs. Those fixed costs have typically been covered in large part by student enrollment. Now that enrollment is declining, higher education’s cost curve is breaking. No amount of cutting will fix the underlying problem. Many colleges have masked their operating deficiencies by using Covid-relief funds in the past few years, but now, with those funds exhausted, they are dealing with a broken economic model. The Trump administration’s cuts to research funding are adding additional stress to colleges’ already precarious cost structure.\n\n\nMore damaging than the cost curve is the shift in how students view the value of higher education. Having grown up with Amazon, Netflix, and Google, students expect a speedy, on-demand, and low-friction experience. Moreover, they increasingly view college through a transactional lens: They pursue a degree to get a job. So they regard college much like any other consumer product, and like those other products, they expect it to be delivered how they want, when they want.

The university’s president, James E. Ryan, said the move signaled that “becoming a more diverse, equitable place is both the right and the smart thing to do.”\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the board voted unanimously to rescind any such numerical goals as part of a sweeping effort to wipe out evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The Trump administration had warned university officials, only the day before, that it had received complaints that the university wasn’t acting fast enough to carry through on its promise to “dismantle DEI apparatuses.”\n\n\nIn its letter on Monday, the Justice Department said the president had failed to produce a sufficiently detailed progress report. (A campus spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about whether the required report had been submitted.) It demanded that Ryan and Hardie certify by Friday that the vestiges of DEI have been removed from every division, department, program, and school.\n\n\nThe Board of Visitors deliberated during a closed session on Tuesday. The public portion of the meeting was not live-streamed. It’s unclear whether the board brought up the fact that Ryan, who became president in 2018, was one of more than 550 higher-education leaders who signed a statement circulated by the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) that condemned “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe.\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate was concerned enough about the board’s reaction that on Monday, it passed a resolution supporting Ryan and his decision to sign the AAC&U statement, saying it “expresses principles that are essential to upholding UVA’s mission, reputation, and operations.”\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate had encouraged Ryan to collaborate with other university presidents to promote higher education’s contributions to the nation.

Newton wrote in an email. “It would result in diminished financial aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs, and lost opportunities for innovation.

We look to you for leadership and coalition-building during a time when the stakes have never been higher.\n\n\nWe ask all sixty institutions under government threat to unite in a coordinated, proactive defense.\n\n(~3009 signatories)\n\nAdvocating for Brown – What’s at stake | Office of the President | Brown University\n\nhttps://president.brown.edu/president/advocating-brown-whats-stake\n\nIt’s important to share what is at stake for Brown. The research funding cuts that Brown has already suffered are causing immediate harm, forcing us to reconfigure our operations and budget to address funding shortfalls. Any long-term cuts of significant magnitude would imperil, or possibly end, several areas of high-impact research at Brown. This would be devastating to Brown’s research community, including the undergraduate, graduate and medical students we teach, and the people, patients and communities that benefit from the results of our research.\n\n\nEven more concerning, since early April, Brown has not been reimbursed for any expenses associated with active (i.e., not terminated) grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), whose grants make up roughly 70% of Brown’s overall research portfolio. Again, we have not been given any official explanation for why expenses for active grants are not being reimbursed. These unreimbursed expenses, which amount to millions of dollars per week, represent a significant threat to Brown’s financial sustainability and its ability to conduct federally funded research.\n\n\nAs we navigate the current environment, I continue to share a set of core principles:\n\n\nBrown will always defend the ability for students and scholars to teach and learn without fear of government intrusion or censorship, which is fundamental to efforts to protect academic freedom.\n\n\nBrown is deeply committed to following the law and maintaining an academic community where all can participate fully in the life of the institution. This means maintaining a campus that is free of all forms of harassment and discrimination for all community members, including addressing allegations of discrimination based on shared ancestry. We are proud of our initiatives to combat antisemitism, many of which we launched even before this became a major area of focus for the federal government.\n\n\nBrown will continue to provide resources and support to members of our international community."

And faculty members at the Big Ten universities are ramping up pressure on their institutions to collaborate and defend one another against threats from the administration.\n\n\nMore and More Faculty Groups Want Their Colleges to Stand Together Against Trump\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/more-and-more-faculty-groups-want-their-colleges-to-stand-together-against-trump\n\nFaculty senates across the nation are endorsing the idea of standing collectively against the actions of the Trump administration. Ten of the Big Ten’s 18 member institutions have adopted resolutions in recent weeks calling for an alliance among that group’s members, and on Saturday the State University of New York’s University Faculty Senate also endorsed a mutual-defense compact.\n\n\nWithin the City University of New York system, the Senates at Hunter College, Hostos Community College, and the City College of New York have done the same for a New York-based effort.\n\n\nSupport for mutual-defense compacts has come alongside several other efforts to stand against the Trump administration’s actions, among them the AAC&U statement condemning “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe, which now has been signed by more than 500 higher-ed leaders.\n\n\nPresidents and trustees from about 10 institutions have also formed an informal private collective to discuss possible responses to the administration, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The Journal did not name those institutions but noted that they included Ivy League campuses and top private research universities, primarily in blue states.\n\n\nA call for unity among researchers, libraries, publishers, journalists and the public in fighting the Trump administration.\n\nhttps://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2025/04/30/trump-v-research-how-we-could-turn-the-threats-into-opportunities/\n(Thanks BE!)\n\n“while it’s encouraging to see some organizations coming together within their existing siloes, that’s not enough. There’s a real opportunity – and imperative – for all stakeholders in the research community to join forces. Each group plays a vital role in the research endeavor. Now is the time to show our support for everyone’s contributions, and to help everyone understand that, by dismantling the research infrastructure through censorship and defunding, we hamper research progress and its benefits in the US and across the world. We call on the industry bodies that represent all these different stakeholders to leverage their relationships and networks to develop something that’s bigger than just a campaign — a movement that spans all individuals and organizations working to fund, conduct, support, and disseminate the science and scholarship essential for our survival and success.\n\n\n“So let’s set aside our usual disagreements (open access business models, pricing, copyright, etc., etc.) to focus on what’s really important right now.

When Mr. Trump began threatening the university with canceled funds this spring, many Harvard professors and students urged administrators to head straight to the ramparts and denounce him. Alan Garber, Harvard’s president, took a wiser approach. He acknowledged that some of Mr. Trump’s criticisms had merit. Harvard, like much of elite higher education, has, in fact, been blasé about antisemitism, and it has too often prioritized progressive ideology over an independent search for truth.\n\n\nBy admitting as much, Mr. Garber strengthened Harvard’s political position. He said what many Americans believed. But when the administration issued a list of ludicrous demands, Harvard fought back hard. It filed a lawsuit, with help from a legal team that included conservative litigators, and became a national symbol of resistance to his lawlessness. Mr. Garber made Harvard look reasonable and Mr. Trump unreasonable."

You need to trace its roots in the 1960s, its evolution through the culture wars of the 1980s and ’90s, and into the current populist fray. Then you need to do something about it. Professors, administrators, students, and concerned citizens can no longer stand on the sidelines, shaking our heads and deploring the potentially devastating consequences. The simple truth is this: For decades, outside forces have — both consciously and unintentionally — undermined the integrity and quality of public higher education in America. And time and time again, a divided academic community has failed to combat them effectively. We can and must do better. Seeds of resistance are sprouting. Together, we must nurture their growth. There is no time to lose.\n\n(Though it was written in 2022, this is an excellent historic overview beginning with Reagan’s rise on the backs of student protestors at UC Berkeley.)"

Allow Ed Tech to offer more predatory degrees, then allow more admin friendly accreditors, then go after existing accreditors?)\n\n“As an accreditor with institutions that have been stalled in the process, this guidance will have a positive impact on the work we have been doing with several institutions. We look forward to helping our institutions understand what this may mean for them and for us,” MSCHE president Heather Perfetti wrote. “We appreciate that there are well-defined restrictions that will not allow for institutions to change accreditors to avoid accountability with an existing accreditor.”\n\n\nAre You Ready for the AI University?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/are-you-ready-for-the-ai-university\n\nIn the movie Blade Runner 2049, one of the characters (coincidentally an AI humanoid) says about the rise of AI: “You can’t hold the tide back with a broom.” We are at a tidal moment.\n\n\nColleges have traditionally relied on economies of scale to maintain their bottom lines. With labs, dormitories, lecture halls, athletic facilities, and so much else, colleges have exorbitant fixed costs. Those fixed costs have typically been covered in large part by student enrollment. Now that enrollment is declining, higher education’s cost curve is breaking. No amount of cutting will fix the underlying problem. Many colleges have masked their operating deficiencies by using Covid-relief funds in the past few years, but now, with those funds exhausted, they are dealing with a broken economic model. The Trump administration’s cuts to research funding are adding additional stress to colleges’ already precarious cost structure.\n\n\nMore damaging than the cost curve is the shift in how students view the value of higher education. Having grown up with Amazon, Netflix, and Google, students expect a speedy, on-demand, and low-friction experience. Moreover, they increasingly view college through a transactional lens: They pursue a degree to get a job. So they regard college much like any other consumer product, and like those other products, they expect it to be delivered how they want, when they want. Why wouldn’t they?\n\nI’d quote the next line, but it ends with “AI is going to decimate faculty ranks”… But I will quote this one:\n\nThe big mistake faculty members make is underestimating the existential threat AI represents to their livelihoods.\n\n\nIs Your Online Student a Bot?\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/is-your-online-student-a-bot\n(Following an article K had shared earlier)"

The report said that bias incidents had been occurring before the Hamas attack and were intensified by the war in Gaza. It found that antisemitism seemed to be more pronounced in branches of the university with a social justice bent, including the graduate school of education, the divinity school and the school of public health.\n\n\nA similar task force held hundreds of conversations with Muslim, Arab and Palestinian students, staff and faculty members about anti-Muslim bias.

Over the next month and a half, it would turn to the same playbook to wrest billions of dollars from universities it accused of antisemitism and other forms of discrimination, ignoring legal and procedural safeguards that had been set up to ensure due process.\n\n\nPresident Trump’s willingness to break norms and bend the rule of law has sparked confusion and alarm on college campuses.\n\n\nEducation Dept.

The university’s president, James E. Ryan, said the move signaled that “becoming a more diverse, equitable place is both the right and the smart thing to do.”\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the board voted unanimously to rescind any such numerical goals as part of a sweeping effort to wipe out evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The Trump administration had warned university officials, only the day before, that it had received complaints that the university wasn’t acting fast enough to carry through on its promise to “dismantle DEI apparatuses.”\n\n\nIn its letter on Monday, the Justice Department said the president had failed to produce a sufficiently detailed progress report. (A campus spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about whether the required report had been submitted.) It demanded that Ryan and Hardie certify by Friday that the vestiges of DEI have been removed from every division, department, program, and school.\n\n\nThe Board of Visitors deliberated during a closed session on Tuesday. The public portion of the meeting was not live-streamed. It’s unclear whether the board brought up the fact that Ryan, who became president in 2018, was one of more than 550 higher-education leaders who signed a statement circulated by the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) that condemned “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe.\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate was concerned enough about the board’s reaction that on Monday, it passed a resolution supporting Ryan and his decision to sign the AAC&U statement, saying it “expresses principles that are essential to upholding UVA’s mission, reputation, and operations.”\n\n\nThe Faculty Senate had encouraged Ryan to collaborate with other university presidents to promote higher education’s contributions to the nation. Ryan’s signature, it said, reaffirmed the university’s established policies on institutional statements and free expression. The former discourages the university from commenting on social or political issues “unless the matter directly affects the university’s mission or operations.”\n\n\nTrump’s 100-Day War on Higher Ed\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/04/30/how-trumps-first-100-days-transformed-higher-ed\n10 things done such as “Pursuing Punishment as Policy” and “Breeding Financial Uncertainty” and “Tanking America’s Global Stature”.

Newton wrote in an email. “It would result in diminished financial aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs, and lost opportunities for innovation. The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America,” he wrote.\n\nAlso reported here\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/us/white-house-harvard-tax-status\n\nNYTimes: Harvard’s Trick for Fighting Trump?

Those additions, made at the 11th hour, include a post-tenure review process that measures productivity, guidance that makes faculty-governance groups “advisory only,” and a provision that gives the governor sole power to appoint trustees at Indiana University at Bloomington.\n\n\nThree Competing Visions Drive Trump’s Higher-Ed Policy\n\nhttps://www.chronicle.com/article/three-competing-visions-drive-trumps-higher-ed-policy?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=campaign_13379969_nl_Academe-Today_date_20250430\n\n.

Rufo’s culture war. Ironically, none of these three people are Trump appointees themselves.
