<p>(This is Marshak building.)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia that is caused by Legionella bacteria, which grow in warm water and spread through building water systems. The city’s outbreak has been linked to cooling towers, which use water and a fan to cool buildings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Health officials disclosed Thursday that 12 cooling towers within Harlem buildings tested positive for the bacteria. Those affected include Harlem Hospital, a city health clinic, a popular retail center on 125th Street, a CUNY college science building and the Harlem condo center on Lenox Avenue.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We are pleased to inform that the test results were negative for legionella bacteria. This confirms that the cooling tower system is in compliance with The New York CITY Department of Health and mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) requirements and poses no health risk to building occupants or the community.</p>

<p>(Much here in T. Edsall’s piece applies to higher education)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Culturally, Trump is seeking to redefine the boundaries of public discourse: pressuring universities, elevating grievance politics and reshaping federal agencies to reflect ideological loyalty rather than expertise or experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For Sean Wilentz, a historian at Princeton, the word “intrusive” fails to capture the full scope of Trump’s agenda. Writing by email, Wilentz argued that Trump “has intimidated major institutions of civil society, including universities, major law firms, and the corporate media, to bend them to his will. He has deployed the military for political purposes. He has militarized ICE and turned it into nation’s largest law enforcement force, accountable only to himself and Stephen Miller, thus laying the basis for a police state. …”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For Trump, the rule of law is not a principle of democratic government; it is a speed bump on the road to exercising unilateral authority. In his own mind, he is on a path to the ultimate in gold-plated power.</p>

<li>Tex. Boards Abolish Faculty Senates, Create Toothless Councils</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/08/22/tex-boards-abolish-faculty-senates-create">https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/shared-governance/2025/08/22/tex-boards-abolish-faculty-senates-create</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The University of Texas System Board of Regents voted Thursday to disband the system’s long-standing faculty senates in compliance with Senate Bill 37, the sweeping Texas higher education law that gives university boards and presidents control over faculty governing bodies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The UT board also voted Thursday to create faculty advisory groups, which will “perform the work of faculty governance bodies”—such as reviewing degree requirements, suggesting curricular changes, coordinating campus events and revising the faculty handbook—while keeping all decision-making power in the hands of the administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But the groups won’t give the faculty independent representation or any real power. In accordance with SB 37, the board bylaws now state, “a faculty council is advisory only and may not be delegated the final decision-making authority on any matter.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Even as university governing boards design their toothless, SB 37–compliant groups, two professors at the University of Houston on Monday unveiled what they’re calling the Faux Faculty Senate. “I know that people feel that faculty senates are kind of arcane … but it’s a part of civil society,” said David Mazella, an associate professor in the English Department at the University of Houston and president-elect of the faux senate. “[SB 37] is an antidemocratic bill that essentially eliminates the faculty voice in order for the state to directly control what we do.”</p>

<p>Q: We’re now more than six months into Trump’s second administration. What is the current state of academic freedom?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A: It’s being washed over by an administration that has no respect, or even probably understanding, of the concept. We’re seeing massive infringement of academic freedom at the individual level. But then, it’s also the academic freedom of institutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I never expected the Trump administration to take a democracy, or the health of American society, to heart, because they’re grifters and they’re in it for their own personal power and their own personal wealth. But I did not expect that they would be so outlandishly intent on destroying a sector that’s so important to the fundamental values and power of American society.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Vance and Trump and [Christopher] Rufo and Stephen Miller and the ilk that run our government are fascist in a 21st-century variant—not operating within the constructs of our society, [but] trying to rip those constructs down.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[Secondly,] we sued the Trump administration on our own six times. With our AFT [American Federation of Teachers] as our [union] affiliate … probably another three or four times.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>They’re doing so many things that are so obviously unconstitutional and illegal, and so we’re trying to use the courts to slow them down.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The third [tactic]—and you’ll see more of this, but you’ve probably been watching and seen it throughout the spring of last year—is getting our people into the streets, fighting back, offering a different vision. This has primarily happened in response to the NIH, NSF cuts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The fourth area is that we need to offer … a countervision of higher education to the Trump vision, which is higher education ideologically controlled by the federal government, in its most extreme form, as well as the complete destruction of our biomedical research infrastructure and our research over all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>We’re working on a policy vision that will move us into the midterms … a counterimaginary of higher ed to the imaginary that’s been developed by the Trump administration, by Chris Rufo, one where we’re all Marxist ideologues indoctrinating our students.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Over the past seven months, Mr.&nbsp;Trump’s words and actions have revealed what he sees as an ideal picture of the United States, in which the concept of diversity is taboo; the traditional power centers in America — white and wealthy men — get the benefit of the doubt; immigrants are suspect or unwelcome; and people of color must set their grievances and outrage aside.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the view of his critics, Mr.&nbsp;Trump has used the power of the federal government to promote a vision of America that not only challenges the legitimacy of the Black experience, but also demeans and dehumanizes people of color. In the process, they say, he has elevated and even endorsed a version of American culture that venerates a white-dominated society of old, and casts the history and reality of race in the United States as unwelcome or suspiciously “woke.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the first months of his second term, Mr.&nbsp;Trump has abandoned core tenets of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Pentagon has ordered military leaders to review all books in their libraries that address racism and sexism. The administration announced this week that it would begin screening immigrants seeking to live or work in the United States for “anti-American ideologies.” Mr.&nbsp;Trump has banned almost every refugee from entering the country, with the exception of white South African farmers who federal officials have said would better assimilate into the United States.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Federal agencies have obscured published references to the contributions of Black heroes, from the Tuskegee Airmen who fought in the military, to Harriet Tubman, who guided enslaved people along the Underground Railroad. He has accused the Smithsonian Institution of incorporating “divisive, race-centered ideology” in its exhibits on race.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Several of Mr.&nbsp;Trump’s appointees have amplified extremist views, including on official social media accounts. The Department of Homeland Security in June shared a poster that called for reporting “foreign invaders,” an image that was originally shared by a podcaster who hosts a Christian nationalist show and calls himself a supporter of the “Old American Right.” The host has said the concept affirms “the domination and pre-eminence of the European-derived peoples, their institutions and their way of life.”</p>

<p>Between the federal government’s heightened vetting of student visas and President Trump’s travel ban, the number of international students newly enrolled in American universities seems certain to drop — by a lot.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There were about a million international students studying in the United States a year ago, according to figures published by the State Department.

<p>The regulations are expected to replace “duration of status,” a 1991 rule that allows international students to remain in the country as long as they are enrolled at a college or university. In 2020, the administration proposed limiting that time to just four years—a period shorter than most Ph.D.&nbsp;programs and shorter than the average student takes to complete a bachelor’s degree—though it would have allowed students to apply for extensions.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights is so short-staffed that some attorneys have as many as 300 cases, making it impossible to devote attention to most of them, current and former employees said. Fewer cases are being closed, and 90 percent of those resolved were dismissed, typically without an investigation, up from 80 percent last year, according to data obtained by The Washington Post.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>At the same time, under Trump, the civil rights office has announced investigations of at least 99 schools, often based on news coverage or complaints from conservative groups. As of early August, the administration had launched 27 directed investigations, probes that are opened without an outside complaint, court filings show.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On January 28, hours after the Trump administration announced the first round of grant cancellations (which was later scaled back before being renewed last week), UChicago administrators sent out an alarming directive to researchers at the school:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“We are requesting that all University researchers working on federal grants temporarily suspend their non-personnel spending on [sic] federal grants as much as possible during this period of substantial uncertainty. For example, do not make any additional spending commitments, purchase new supplies or equipment, start new experiments, embark on funded travel, etc.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>UChicago has since walked back their directive, sending a clarifying email that researchers could resume normal spending, unless they’d received a specific directive otherwise. However, behind the scenes, the situation remains dire: Labs have received orders to downsize, faculty are being paid out to retire early, and fear and uncertainty pervade the academic community.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>UChicago’s financial position is clear: Unlike near-peer institutions, its endowment is not large enough to sustain its spending and debt. The university carries nearly $6 billion in debt while running annual budget deficits exceeding $200 million, all on an endowment three times smaller than Stanford’s. To compensate, the university has focused on expanding lucrative certification programs, increasing donations, raising tuitions, and cutting costs, though many faculty and students viscerally disagree with the administration on which costs to cut.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Possibly the most notorious example is the university’s foray into cryptocurrency. Four sources, as well as widespread campus rumors, allege that the university lost tens of millions investing in crypto around 2021. Given UChicago’s extraordinary 37.6% endowment gain that year, far beyond what conventional investments would have yielded, it’s likely they took significant risks. But if those gambles paid off in the short term, they quickly unraveled. … UChicago’s endowment remains lower today than in 2021.</p>

<p>This investigation comes amid credible reports … “Like many other institutions of higher education, Haverford College is alleged to have … said Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor. … During President Raymond’s Congressional testimony, she claimed that there is “no room for discrimination” at Haverford but failed to give a concrete example of an action taken to combat alleged anti-Semitic harassment …</p>

<li>NYTimes: How College Financial Troubles Could Reshape the Student Experience</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Colleges are eliminating or consolidating programs, sometimes dozens of them on a single campus. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is planning to more than halve its financial aid budget for out-of-state students. From coast to coast, graduate schools are admitting fewer applicants.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The financial squeeze comes just as demographic trends point toward plunging enrollments in the coming years that could force further belt-tightening.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Although months may pass before some of the most drastic shifts take effect, students and administrators alike are facing uncertainty over how much a school could potentially change over the course of a semester, much less an entire degree program.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Some of the turmoil traces directly to the Trump administration, which has been seeking to punish a clutch of elite schools. It is also, more broadly, trying to transform the financial ties between Washington and the nation’s colleges.</p>

<p>With higher education under political assault, and opportunities as well as job security diminished by enrollment declines, Cossette felt burnt out and disillusioned. So she quit her hard-won job as an assistant professor of American government at a small private college in Maryland and used the skills she’d learned to go into business for herself as a freelance copy editor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now Cossette is hearing from other newly minted Ph.D.s and tenured faculty who want out — so many, she’s expanded her business to help them leave academia, as she did.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>An exodus appears to be under way of Ph.D.s and faculty generally, who are leaving academia in the face of political, financial and enrollment crises. It’s a trend federal data and other sources show began even before Trump returned to the White House.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As for faculty, more than a third of provosts reported higher-than-usual turnover last year, in a survey by Hanover Research and the industry publication Inside Higher Ed. That was before the turmoil of this late winter and spring.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“People who can get out will get out,” said L. Maren Wood, director and CEO of the Center for Graduate Career Success,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“You’re basically knee-capping that younger generation, which undermines the intergenerational dynamism that takes place in higher education. And that trickles down into the classroom,” said Isaac Kamola, an associate professor of political science at Trinity College and head of the Center for the Defense of Academic Freedom at the American Association of University Professors, or AAUP.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/08/22/rise-incompetents-opinion">https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2025/08/22/rise-incompetents-opinion</a></p>

<p>In one of the articles I found myself scrolling, John Villasenor, writing for the Brookings Institution, suggested that LLMs would lead to “the democratization of good writing.” I was surprised to see that description. The ChatGPT-produced assignments I see on a weekly basis are rarely mistakable for “good.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The USS also believes AI will democratize learning)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>More to the point, research suggests that uniform style and content will not produce a level playing field of competent writers but, more likely, a ceiling of barely capable thinkers. In a study published by Nature Human Behaviour, researchers discovered that “reliance on ChatGPT … reduces the diversity of ideas in a pool of ideas,” to the degree that “94 percent of ideas from those who used ChatGPT ‘shared overlapping concepts.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Of course, the choices don’t end there. I also decided how to approach the topic; what references to pull; how to order my paragraphs (both before and after I wrote them); what idioms, metaphors and introductory language to use; where to place hooks and callbacks; what to title the piece; and how to utilize grammar and punctuation to express my sassy indignation. These are vital skills for students to practice, not because they’re required in every profession, but because they emphasize executive function and cognitive reasoning. Writers are responsible for what they write, speakers for what they say, leaders for what they decide and voters for whom they elect. This in and of itself is reason enough to teach actual writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Both thematically and practically, this partnership, forged in campaign contributions, public appearances and the elimination of internal dissent (see: Jeff Bezos and The Washington Post), represents a threat to the university system. The Trump White House, intent on canceling research grants, deporting students and revoking accreditation, has very clearly demonstrated its opposition to “the elites” of academia. Ignorant consumers, like ignorant voters, are easier to manipulate, and ignorance thrives when education falters.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The falseness of LLM-generated content is a perfect fit for the reality-rejecting ethos of the Trump administration. Back in April, the White House was accused of outsourcing its world-altering tariff calculations to ChatGPT. In May, the Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., published a report that experts discovered was filled with what appeared to be AI-generated false citations.</p>
