<p>the Commission is authorizing additional funding of $566 million in 2025-2027, making Europe “a magnet for researchers.” This funding is in addition to the European Research Council’s budget of $18 billion for 2021-2027. Moreover, the EU will “enshrine freedom of scientific research into law” via a new enactment. Europe will not compromise on its long-standing principles of academic freedom.</p>

<p>(Where to categorize this ham-handed attempt to shut down discourse)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The email arrived in early February from the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen, carrying a blunt message. It informed the organizers of a Danish lecture series — one I was soon scheduled to speak at — that the final portion of American funding would be released only after they signed a statement essentially saying they were in compliance with a U.S. executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Before the organizers at the University of Southern Denmark could respond, the U.S. State Department sent an even blunter message: The grant was “being terminated for the convenience of the U.S. government.” It concluded by thanking the Danes “for your partnering with the Department of State and God Bless America.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Second, the cutoff of funding was followed nearly two weeks later by another message to the university. (I viewed copies of all the emails.) It said that a recent court hearing prevented the State Department from holding up congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds and ordered it to make the financing available. It further ordered the department to “provide written notice of this order” to recipients of grants. Notifying the Danish university was as far as the administration went in complying with the court. The remaining funds haven’t been released yet, organizers say — typical of the Trump administration’s defiance of the courts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Another core element of freedom — indeed something essential to its survival — is that power must be limited; there have to be checks and balances not just within government but within society. I have long warned that the concentration of wealth among a small percentage of the population would provide a fertile field for a demagogue, and that there was an ample supply of people who might play the part.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Universities, which protect academic freedom, are as important to this system of checks and balances as other civil rights protections like freedom of the press.</p>

<p>In February, the Yale School of Medicine began offering temporary funding to researchers with terminated grants—many related to topics the Trump administration has deemed unworthy of scientific inquiry, such as transgender health—to give them time to reorient their research. Yale’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is also investing $4 million to support graduate students who have lost training and research grants. Similarly, last month Johns Hopkins University announced that it is tapping earnings from its $13.2 billion endowment to give researchers $100,000 each for delayed grants, or $150,000 for terminated grants, during a 12-month period. And Northwestern University—which hasn’t received any grant payments from the National Institutes of Health since March—is offering faculty up to $50,000 to maintain projects for up to one year.</p>

<p>Over the past several decades, universities have already substantially increased the amount of money they spend on their own research and development—from 10 percent of the total in 1970 to 25 percent in 2023, according to federal data. Meanwhile, federal support for academic research has been on the decline, falling from 71 percent to 55 percent during that same timeframe. And support from industry, charities and other sources have always been marginal, collectively making up about 15 percent of contributions to research funding at colleges and universities in 2023.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While that won’t cover all of the terminated grants, “the bridge has to go somewhere,” he said, explaining that the program isn’t supporting projects that don’t have viable alternative long-term funding options.

<p>Freedom of expression is not merely an abstract principle, or even a constitutional right, but a practical necessity for meaningful advisory work. In Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, published as short stories in the late 1940s and as a novel in 1953, warned not only of the destruction of books, but of a society in which people had lost the desire to read them. The parallel today is not only the administration’s effort to destroy and suppress knowledge, but also the institution’s willingness to accept the cultivated irrelevance of it—a challenge that undermines any serious effort to conduct research, inform policy, or guide public institutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF)—established as an independent agency through the National Science Act of 1950 and marking its 75th anniversary this week—traces its roots to Vannevar Bush’s landmark report, “Science, the Endless Frontier,” addressed to President Harry S. Truman. But we might also see the establishment of this premier research institution as reflecting a response to fears depicted by Bradbury. The NSF can be understood not only as a catalyst of scientific promise for national purpose, but also as a guarded response to fears about centralized control over knowledge and thought, shaped by the dark shadows of the Third Reich and the emerging Red Scare.</p>

<p>Our closed-to-the-public deliberations were observed by Zachary Terrell from the DOGE team.

According to Nature Terrell, listed as a “consultant” in the NSF directory, had accessed the NSF awards system to block the dispersal of approved grants. The message I received was that the National Science Board had a role to play in name only.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>All of this is threatened by the creeping normalization of authoritarian approaches to knowledge management and academic freedom. The National Science Board has not been disbanded like so many other statutorily established, independent agencies in the federal government. But preservation of form provides little consolation when function has been strategically neutralized, mirroring the backsliding that scholars have thoroughly documented: maintaining legitimacy for institutions that no longer honor their founding purposes. This hollowing out is not just about governance in the abstract, it has material consequences for which research questions get asked, which datasets get produced, which knowledge gets produced, and which perspectives shape our understanding of pressing societal challenges. It has consequences for the integrity of knowledge itself.</p>

And it is false that the Library, which is intended to hold all books published in the United States, lends books to children. The ouster of Hayden is part of a broader pattern of political targeting of women and Black public servants across the federal government.</p>

<p>Penn State has submitted a declaration of support for a joint lawsuit that seeks to halt the Trump administration’s decision to significantly cut payments for costs associated with National Science Foundation-funded research grants and cooperative agreements.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The university, which is not a party to the lawsuit, said in a statement that based on its NSF funding for fiscal year 2023-24, the cut would mean a $20 million loss for Penn State’s research enterprise.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The NSF announced on May 2 that it would cap reimbursements for indirect costs — which include expenses such as specialized research equipment and facilities, operations and maintenance and administrative functions — at 15% for new grant awards made after May 5. The change, according to the NSF, “is intended to streamline funding practices, increase transparency, and ensure that more resources are directed toward direct scientific and engineering research activities.”</p>

<p>On May 8, the Department of Education announced an investigation of Western Carolina University, a comprehensive public institution in Cullowhee, North Carolina. The university, it alleged, had violated Title IX by allowing transgender female students in women’s restrooms, locker rooms, and dorm rooms.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Payton McNabb, a former student whose complaints about WCU’s transgender policies brought conservative media attention to the university, said she didn’t experience WCU as quiet. She felt professors treated conservative students differently, and she was hurt by a university Title IX investigation into her conduct after she posted a video of herself asking a transgender woman why she was in a women’s bathroom on campus.</p>

<p>The emails that seem to have triggered the Department of Education’s investigation have been framed by Speech First [a group dedicated to protecting the expression of certain conservative stances at colleges] as evidence that WCU is deliberately defying President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>The Department of Education’s scrutiny “feels punitive,” Gómez [secretary for the Faculty Senate] said. “It feels like this is part of a trend to both try to dismantle higher education and to ultimately undermine faculty governance and academic freedom.” The department’s Title IX investigation is related to faculty governance, Gómez said, because the Faculty Senate had previously supported an effort to make campus bathrooms more welcoming to transgender people.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The House Committee on Education &amp; Workforce recently drafted legislation that would cut $350 billion in student aid. The savings come mostly from increasing loan-payment requirements and making it harder to qualify for Pell Grants. As others have explained, these measures will harm the lowest-income borrowers and reduce college access. If the committee has its way, the cuts will be bundled into a reconciliation bill in which these savings would pay for tax cuts tilted heavily toward the wealthy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>another surprising roadblock to the House accountability provisions should loom large: …DOGE. … Now that DOGE has forced out half the Education Department’s staff and President Trump is looking to eviscerate it, such execution will be out of reach. In other words, today’s Republican Party has a lot of different factions, but they can’t all win: If conservative lawmakers mean for the department to implement the accountability ideas in their current proposal, they will need to confront the Trump administration.</p>
