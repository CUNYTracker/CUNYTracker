<h1>May 23</h1>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.</p>
<p>As BE said: “The quantity of higher ed related reporting and the speed with which this is all happening can take your breath away.”</p>
<p>Thanks to VAC, MP, EI, and BE for sharing articles.</p>
<p>Sorry this is a day off, but we wouldn’t have got to see the full cycle of sabotage of Harvard through international students: starting with a stated block on visas for international students, to our collective uttering “that must be illegal”, to a lawsuit by Harvard, to a judicial block.</p>

<p>(This article discusses the engineered backlash against protesters by the Heritage Foundation using federal funding as the cudgel. That idea has found quite wide use)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now the Heritage contingent was in Israel, in part, to discuss another contentious policy paper: Project Esther, the foundation’s proposal to rapidly dismantle the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States, along with its support at schools and universities, at progressive organizations and in Congress.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Drafted in the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel in 2023 and the mounting protests against the war in Gaza, Project Esther outlined an ambitious plan to fight antisemitism by branding a broad range of critics of Israel as “effectively a terrorist support network,” so that they could be deported, defunded, sued, fired, expelled, ostracized and otherwise excluded from what it considered “open society.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Project Esther’s architects envisioned outcomes that at the time might have seemed far-fetched. Curriculum it believed to be sympathetic to a “Hamas support” narrative would be taken out of schools and universities, and “supporting faculty” would be removed. Social media would be purged of content deemed to be antisemitic. Institutions would lose public funding. Foreign students who pushed for Palestinian rights would have their visas revoked, or be deported.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Heritage national security director who coauthored Project Esther, said it was “no coincidence that we called for a series of actions to take place privately and publicly, and they are now happening.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But Project Esther aims to go further, equating actions such as participating in pro-Palestinian campus protests with providing “material support” for terrorism, a broad legal construct that can lead to prison time, deportations, civil penalties and other serious consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Project Esther changed the paradigm by associating anyone who opposes Israeli policies with the ‘Hamas Support Network,’”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Some evangelical Christians have increasingly aligned themselves with conservative political forces in Israel, supporting their claims of biblical dominion over contested Palestinian territories. Many feel a kinship with Israel because of shared religious heritage. But some also believe that supporting Israel will hasten biblical end times, or advance Christianity’s global influence.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In recent months, foreign students—particularly those participating in pro-Palestine protests—have had their student visas threatened or have been detained and placed in deportation proceedings, signaling a sharp and politically charged shift in federal policy. At the same time, public and private research universities, which depend heavily on international students’ tuition and labor—especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines—are facing the erosion of a vital economic pillar. These developments threaten not only the foundational rights of free speech and academic freedom but also the financial stability of the institutions that anchor the U.S. higher education system and conduct the vital research on which the future will be built.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Far from isolated incidents, these cases reflect an emerging strategy—leveraging immigration enforcement as a tool of political suppression. International students have become an ideal scapegoat: politically vulnerable, culturally diverse, and often outspoken. Immigration officials now claim broad authority to revoke visas for “supporting terrorism,” using vague, expansive definitions. The result is a chilling effect on campus expression and a stark warning to those who would protest U.S. policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For academic leaders like Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, the strategy is transparent. “They want to undermine higher education and also heighten the new Cold War on campus,” Wolfson said.</p>

<li>Skilled immigration on the chopping block? Effects of eliminating “Optional Practical Training” in the US | PIIE</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/skilled-immigration-chopping-block-effects-eliminating-optional">https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2025/skilled-immigration-chopping-block-effects-eliminating-optional</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>That may soon change. The US administration is under pressure to constrict or eliminate the largest single pipeline into lawful immigration for high-skilled, university-educated workers. This pipeline is called Optional Practical Training (OPT)—a temporary work permit given to some foreign graduates of US universities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Optional Practical Training is a federal program that allows most international students at US universities the choice to work in the United States for a limited period after they graduate. About 72 percent of foreign graduates use OPT. The permit generally lasts one year but extends to three years for graduates at any educational level in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It is a work permit attached to the student visa, a bridge between university enrollment and the workforce, granted under regulations starting in 1947.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This [expecting a renaissance of rich controversies], of course, is politically naïve. As the historian of science Michael Hagner predicted in 2019, the commitment of right-wing populists to epistemic pluralism only lasts until they manage to establish their own views well enough to eliminate all other points of view. Consider book bans, grant cancellations, and the violation of the First Amendment rights of foreign students and faculty and you will find validated Hagner’s cynical perspective on the authoritarian promotion of viewpoint diversity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Both Harding and Haidt put their fingers on a very real problem: Our collective thinking benefits from looking at any given issue from multiple angles. For all sorts of historical reasons, colleges often do not represent a spectrum that is broad enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This balancing act requires what Aristotle called phronesis, the capacity for good judgment, and it cannot be formalized through viewpoint-diversity audits and affirmative-action policies.</p>

<p>Well, sadly, there’s kind of a long list. I think, from my vantage point, one of the greatest concerns is seeing students, and particularly international students, being, basically, taken away on what appears to be the basis of viewpoints and opinions that they might have shared, either in the form of protest or, in one case, an op-ed.&nbsp;That really flies in the face of exactly what the First Amendment is supposed to protect against, especially in a public institution, which is that it’s supposed to be a restraint on government.</p>

<li>NYTimes: Republican Plan to Tax Elite Colleges Could Hit in Unexpected Places</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The goal of the proposal, laid out in a report last week from Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, is to hold accountable “woke, elite universities that operate more like major corporations.” McPherson [small school that accepts the vast majority of its applicants] could be on the list because it has an endowment of $1.6 billion, thanks to an anonymous donation a few years ago.</p>

<p>(Don’t cry for McPherson, cry that this stealing from the rich to give to the richer is even being proposed.)</p>

<p>(Look at all the interventions from outside that have happened at the University of Utah)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the State Legislature passed an anti-DEI bill, prohibiting, among other things, offices and programs related to diversity, equity or inclusion. Administrators were required to purge these three words from university websites and other documents, such as RPT—retention, promotion and tenure review—guidelines, and the university administration interpreted the law as requiring that the Women’s Resource Center, the Black Cultural Center and the LGBT Resource Center be shuttered.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The state has also imposed a “bathroom bill” requiring trans university students to use locker rooms aligning with their sex assigned at birth, has banned Pride flags in public spaces (and in faculty offices if they can be seen through a window), and now requires faculty to post their syllabi in a publicly searchable database. It also prohibits university presidents from taking a stand on any issue that does not bear upon the “mission, role or pedagogical objectives” of the institution. And finally, as the coup de grâce for academic freedom and faculty expertise, it has funded and established the Center for Civic Excellence at Utah State University, mandating that all students take general education courses on the topics of Western civilization and the rise of Christianity. The law establishing the center identifies it as a pilot program to be rolled out to other Utah universities in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Recently passed laws dictate the process by which all post-tenure reviews of faculty must be conducted, curtail shared governance and cut state funds to all Utah public institutions by 10 percent ($60.5 million). Universities can have the funds “reallocated” if they use them for high-demand, high-wage majors. As a result, we lost our History and Philosophy of Science major, which drew some of our best students, many of them double majoring in STEM subjects and working toward careers in medicine and public health.</p>
