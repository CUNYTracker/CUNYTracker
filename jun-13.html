<h1>Jun 13</h1>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.</p>
<p>Of special note is the announcement that the Chancellor will be joined by the leaders from Georgetown and UC Berkeley at a congressional hearing. This will put CUNY further in the cross hairs of the federal government.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Protest organizers have billed June 14 as a “nationwide day of defiance,” during which Americans across the country stand up to “reject authoritarianism” and reclaim patriotism in the name of democracy. “The flag doesn’t belong to President Trump. It belongs to us,” the protest website declares.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Trump has menaced demonstrators planning to show up at his military procession: “If any protester wants to come out, they will be met with very big force,” he said Tuesday. Anticipating such a reaction, protest organizers specifically decided not to target the Trump parade route; there is not even a No Kings event planned in D.C. They envision, instead, demonstrators “showing up everywhere [Trump] isn’t — to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.”</p>

<p>For staff across the National Institutes of Health (NIH), we dissent to Administration policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe. Keeping NIH at the forefront of biomedical research requires our stalwart commitment to continuous improvement. But the life-and-death nature of our work demands that changes be thoughtful and vetted. We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources.</p>

<p>Over the past several weeks, many of us have been deeply concerned by the federal attacks on higher education – from catastrophic research-funding cuts to assaults on programs that make our universities more just and inclusive. Last year, a majority of us signed cards in support of forming our faculty union so that we can establish a real voice in our working lives.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Unfortunately, USC has so far refused to honor our desire for a stronger voice.</p>

<p>As the Trump administration escalates its pressure campaign, more people in American higher education — and in Vienna — believe the U.S. government is borrowing from a playbook refined in recent years by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who used state power to menace a university he disdained, upend academic independence and strengthen his ideological grip on Hungary.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“At the abstract level, it’s the same,” said Carsten Q. Schneider, a German scholar who has worked for C.E.U. for more than 20 years and will become its interim president and rector in August.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“These demands, these requirements, they are a scale of detail that Orban never bothered with,” Tim Crane, a Britain-born philosophy professor, said at C.E.U.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Universities and their allies need to speak up in defense of core values,” she [Amy Gutmann, a political scientist who led the University of Pennsylvania for nearly 18 years and then served as President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s ambassador to Germany] said, adding that “the C.E.U. experience warns against the instinct to make concessions to an administration that’s intent on punishing the political opposition.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In Mr.&nbsp;Orban’s Hungary, sometimes described as a “propaganda state,” the government transferred control of public universities to foundations — controlled by the ruling party’s allies — and gender studies essentially became a forbidden academic discipline.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In 2017, the Hungarian government, which some prominent figures on the American right have praised, stepped up its effort to undermine the American-accredited university. The campaign was built on legal maneuvering, including a hastily passed law, struck down years later by the European Court of Justice, effectively requiring C.E.U. to open a new campus in the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The university tried to negotiate, but talks with the Hungarian government failed in late 2018. Thousands of Hungarians protested the government’s tactics that year — “Even Voldemort didn’t kick Hogwarts out,” read one sign — but C.E.U. said it had no choice but to leave.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Eva Kiser, a museum studies student at C.E.U. who is from Knoxville, Tenn., said she had been counting on political firewalls in the United States to hold and that things would “blow over.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“But that’s not really looking probable,” she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Don’t expect mercy, or that this is normal and you need to sort of be nice and then they come to their senses,” Dr.&nbsp;Schneider, the incoming interim rector, said. “It is unhinged. …”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Borrowing an idea from the economist Albert O. Hirschman, Professor Dorsch, an American, said universities had three options: leave, obey the government or speak up.</p>

<li>Notes from an Occupation</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2025/06/26/notes-from-an-occupation-marilynne-robinson/">https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2025/06/26/notes-from-an-occupation-marilynne-robinson/</a></p>
<p>(Thanks VAC)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A well-planned occupation seizes the heights of the defeated civilization, so that the people will see their leaders ousted or humiliated and made docile. It will likewise discredit and weaken those features of the culture in which its people placed confidence and pride. If this model were applied to our situation, we might expect to see the Supreme Court diminished, the Congress disempowered, and the Constitution desacralized by indifference or contempt. The press would come under attack. Our incomparable universities and research institutions would lose autonomy and resources. The mighty dollar would be weakened. Bonds with allies would be breached, and the occupied country would be held in contempt for the damage its default had done to the world order, and to democracy, having put aside its responsibility for demonstrating the viability of popular government.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Examples of the seizing of cultural heights abound. In 70 AD the Romans utterly razed the Temple at Jerusalem and Jerusalem itself in order to deal with the Jewish population’s resistance to their oppression. In 1814 the British, still wanting to break the back of the Revolution, burned the American Capitol Building, destroying the Library of Congress.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I am proposing, of course, that America actually is, at present, an occupied country. I will call the occupiers Red and the occupied Blue, since these colors are in general use for distinctions of this kind and seemingly cause no offense.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Within days of taking office, the Trump administration began purging federal demographic data—on a wide range of topics, including public health, education and climate—from government websites to comply with the president’s bans on “gender ideology” and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One of the first data sets to disappear was the White House Council on Environmental Quality’s Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, an interactive map of U.S. Census tracts “marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution,” according to a description written under a previous administration.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The dozen board members of the prestigious Fulbright program that promotes international educational exchanges resigned on Wednesday because of what they said was political interference by the Trump administration in their operations, according to people familiar with the issues and a board memo obtained by The New York Times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://substack.com/inbox/post/165673358?r=17cemi">https://substack.com/inbox/post/165673358?r=17cemi</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The members are concerned that political appointees at the State Department, which manages the program, are acting illegally by canceling the awarding of Fulbright scholarships to almost 200 American professors and researchers who are prepared to go to universities and other research institutions overseas starting this summer,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In addition, the department is reviewing the applications of about 1,200 scholars from other countries who have already been approved by the board to come to the United States, the people said. Those foreign scholars were also supposed to receive acceptance letters around April.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The board is also concerned that the budget that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is requesting from Congress for the next fiscal year cuts spending for the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, which includes the Fulbright program, to $50 million from $691 million this fiscal year.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The bipartisan Fulbright Board was mandated by Congress to be a check on the executive and to ensure that students, researchers and educators are not subjected to the blatant political favoritism that this administration is known for,” Ms.&nbsp;Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“While I understand and respect the bipartisan Fulbright Board for resigning en masse rather than grant credibility to a politicized and unlawful process,” she added, “I am painfully aware that today’s move will change the quality of Fulbright programming and the independent research that has made our country a leader in so many fields.”</p>

<p>Support from the federal government has been so consistent and made such good sense that colleges and universities have built their budgets, infrastructure, and programming around the assumption of its permanence. Trump 2.0 has shown what happens when the government does not behave sensibly and has turned an essential lifeline into an existential risk.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The scorched-earth assault on Harvard University is generating all the headlines, but it might in fact be drawing attention away from an even larger story: the tectonic shift in the future activities and financial underpinnings of American higher education and the even greater risk to institutions that have neither Harvard’s resources nor Harvard’s reputation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Even if universities manage to muddle through Trump’s vindictive irrationality, can they return to building budget models that assume consistently high levels of federal support? JD Vance is waiting in the wings, and who knows what new Trumps and Vances the future might bring?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A small group of the most prestigious and selective universities might be able to substitute affluent domestic students for affluent international students at the undergraduate level, though even those institutions would likely have trouble doing so for master’s-degree programs, where costs are high and return on investment can be questionable. For most colleges, such a substitution would be impossible and tuition revenue would necessarily decline. Subtract the full-paying international students from the applicant pool and an already fragile financial structure would begin very quickly to collapse.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For the ideologues driving the administration’s policies on education and immigration — Linda McMahon and Kristi Noem are not the brains behind this operation — the destructive effects of these various policies are very much the point. None of the consequences we are seeing are unintended.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Devastating scientific research and systematically undermining the preeminence of American universities — like so many of the actions of the Trump administration — represents a triumph of vindictiveness and nihilism over sound public policy. But here we are, about to see how quickly and adroitly the embattled and change-resistant world of higher education can adapt to a future in which the government cannot be trusted.</p>

<p>A bill awaiting Gov.&nbsp;Abbott’s signature would require college administrators to set procedures for faculty governing bodies and appoint their leaders, part of an effort to address “liberal faculty control over universities.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Shared governance structures may not be used to obstruct, delay, or undermine necessary institutional reforms or serve as a mechanism for advancing ideological or political agendas,” says Senate Bill 37, which the Republican-dominated State Legislature passed May 31. Multiple states have considered GOP bills targeting shared governance, but SB 37 is a sweeping example.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If a college or university board decides to keep a faculty governing body, the institution’s president gets to prescribe how it conducts meetings. The president also gets to pick the “presiding officer, associate presiding officer, and secretary.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In addition, unless the college or university’s board decides otherwise, faculty senates and councils must shrink to no more than 60 members.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In another blow to faculty control of their own governance bodies, SB 37 establishes term limits for faculty senate and council members—and allows presidential appointees to serve longer than the elected members.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Two years, then a two year break)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A faculty senate or council member could also have their seat stripped at any time; the bill says the provost can recommend to the president that members be “immediately removed” for failing to attend meetings or conduct their “responsibilities within the council’s or senate’s parameters” or for “similar misconduct.”</p>

<p>Harvard University has spent the last year slowly dismantling a religious-studies program that critics said was biased against Israel, five current and former university employees told The Chronicle. Last week, the final hammer fell: The five remaining staff members employed by the Religion and Public Life program were called, one by one, into meetings with a representative from Harvard’s human-resources department and the program’s interim director, David F.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In an internal report on antisemitism published in April, a task force of professors, students, and advisers had suggested that a lack of rigor among “nonladder” faculty at Harvard was partly to blame for programs and events that task-force members characterized as antisemitic. The task force recommended tenured Harvard faculty members exercise greater oversight of programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Nonladder — or non-tenure-track — faculty deliver about half of the curriculum at the Divinity School, said McKanan, who has a nonladder contract and has been at Harvard for 17 years. “When Harvard chooses to rely on nonladder faculty,” he said, “it becomes a little bit strange and unnatural to exclude that half of the faculty from program leadership and from sponsoring public events on issues of urgent public concern.”</p>

<p>(More weaponization of the federal government, err “Trump administration’s whole-of-government approach to bringing the Ivy League university to heel.”)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio is pushing to investigate whether Harvard University violated federal sanctions by collaborating on a health insurance conference in China that may have included officials blacklisted by the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The New York Times.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Trump and his allies appear determined [hell-bent] to upend nearly all aspects of the institution, which has long symbolized the pinnacle of higher learning in the country and attracted influential scholars from around the globe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(And here we see the fingerprints of the Manhattan Institute)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Still, the X.P.C.C.’s involvement in the conference only recently gained attention from Trump allies, after a report about Harvard’s links to China published on April 22 by Strategy Risks, a New York-based intelligence company specializing in corporate exposure to China. The report was funded by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank that has advised Republican policymakers.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” school officials wrote in a lawsuit asking a judge to stop the federal government’s actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It left unsaid what Harvard, if it were no longer Harvard, would become.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But without federal dollars or international talent, experts say, Harvard could fall out of the top tier for research, where it currently sits with competitors like Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. By sheer dollars spent, its research budget could shrink to something similar to that of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, which spent just over $800 million on research in 2023, roughly half of what Harvard spends now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Harvard could choose to negotiate. But inside the university, officials appear reluctant to do that, given the backlash they could face for capitulating to Mr.&nbsp;Trump. This spring, the university took out $750 million in debt, giving it some cash flow as court decisions play out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The atmosphere is particularly tense inside the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which relies on federal funding for 46 percent of its budget and has a student body that is about 40 percent international. Senior officials there are planning for the worst, and have called the potential changes an “existential crisis” for the school’s future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But Harvard’s biggest source of funding is donations and payouts from its endowment, which together make up 45 percent of its revenue.</p>

<li>At Indiana U., Professors Spar With Administrators Over Nighttime Protests</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/at-indiana-u-professors-spar-with-administrators-over-nighttime-protests">https://www.chronicle.com/article/at-indiana-u-professors-spar-with-administrators-over-nighttime-protests</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Under a policy passed in response to a monthslong pro-Palestinian encampment at Indiana, certain forms of “expressive activity” — including holding protests, making speeches, and circulating petitions — were banned on campus between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Administrators argued that the changes were necessary to ensure safety after the encampment got out of hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The policy banned protests between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., required 10-day prior approval for installing “structures and/or mass physical objects,” and pushed protests 25 feet away from building entrances.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Students and staff sued over the policy. In late May, a federal judge temporarily blocked the nighttime restrictions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Meanwhile, the political climate surrounding the university remains contentious. Last week, Gov.&nbsp;Mike Braun, a Republican, removed the three alumni-elected trustees from Indiana’s board — including two who voted against the expressive-activity policy — and replaced them with conservatives, including a prominent lawyer and a former ESPN anchor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Texas lawmakers just approved legislation broadly banning “any speech or expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment” between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. at public universities. The measure now awaits the governor’s signature.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But Indiana’s expressive-activity policy never specified how many nighttime protesters were too many. That meant even a protest involving two people — unlikely to be a threat to public safety — would require prior approval, the judge said in her order granting the preliminary injunction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>While the decision was far from “novel or surprising,” it will hopefully send a message to universities imposing similar policies that “the courts are not going to put up with this kind of similarly open violation of the First Amendment and so they probably shouldn’t try it,” said Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the George Washington University Law School.</p>

<li>Trump Administration Proposes Cutting Tribal College Funds by Nearly 90% — ProPublica</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Trump administration has proposed cutting funding for tribal colleges and universities by nearly 90%, a move that would likely shut down most or all of the institutions created to serve students disadvantaged by the nation’s historic mistreatment of Indigenous communities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Last month, Peter Hans, president of the University of North Carolina system, casually dropped a bombshell announcement that the system and others were in talks to launch a new accreditor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“We’ve been having a number of discussions with several other major public university systems, where we’re exploring the idea of creating an accreditor that would offer sound oversight,” Hans said at a UNC system Board of Governors meeting last month, The News &amp; Observer reported.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>have been quietly engaged in conversations about launching a new accreditor for at least a year, including discussions with unnamed collaborators in Florida, where the effort could be headquartered. UNC officials have also spoken with officials at the U.S. Department of Education, even getting a heads-up on what an April 23 executive order from the Trump administration on accreditation would entail.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Everything Florida has done on accreditation over the past few years appears to be politically and ideologically driven, rather than about what is best for students and ensuring that they go to high-quality institutions and get a good education when they’re paying a lot of money for it and when taxpayers are investing a lot of money in public funding for higher education,” he said [Edward Conroy, a senior policy manager at the left-leaning think tank New America].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Conroy worries that state lawmakers in either Florida or North Carolina would require public colleges in their state to be accredited by their new accreditor. That would undermine the current requirement that colleges get to choose their own accreditor.</p>

<p>Rather than striking a blow for red-state America, these cuts would actually take a heavy toll on many of the communities in states that went for Mr.&nbsp;Trump in the last election — whose research universities serve as crucial anchors for industry and innovation.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If Mr.&nbsp;Trump wants to make all of America great again, he shouldn’t cut funding for scientific research. He should increase it.</p>

<p>Universities have long played pivotal roles in building world-class high-tech economies: Stanford University helped make Silicon Valley what it is today by fostering technological excellence in electrical engineering, establishing the Stanford Research Park and educating the founders of startups like Hewlett-Packard. Individuals from universities like M.I.T. and Harvard played central roles in transforming Boston from a center of textile and boot and shoe manufacturing to a health-sciences hub by starting the world’s first modern venture capital fund to commercialize academic research.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Carnegie Mellon University helped revitalize Pittsburgh through targeted investments in computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics, coupled with strategic initiatives to bolster local entrepreneurship. The University of Texas at Austin mobilized local business and political leaders to transform Austin into a leading high-tech region. In all of these cases, universities led efforts to reposition their regional economies toward high-tech sectors such as computers, software, biotechnology and robotics.</p>

<p>OpenAI’s campaign is part of an escalating A.I. arms race among tech giants to win over universities and students with their chatbots.

<p>As more than 13 million students filed into rooms across China to sit for the notoriously grueling, high-stakes gaokao college entrance exam, they already faced strict anti-cheating and real-time surveillance measures, including facial recognition technology, metal detectors, drones and cellphone-signal blockers. Vehicles transporting the test papers — classified as state secrets — are equipped with video surveillance. Copies of the test are stored in steel-reinforced rooms that can only be opened by three people, each wielding their own key. China made cheating on exams a criminal act in 2015 — punishable in some cases by prison sentences.</p>
