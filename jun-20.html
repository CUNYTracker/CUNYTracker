<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the spring of 1925, a group of academics, researchers and writers in Italy published an open letter in multiple newspapers, hoping to ring alarm bells over the creeping authoritarianism of Benito Mussolini and his Fascist party. It called for “intrinsic goodness” and recognizing the value of “liberal systems and methods” over “violence and bullying and the suppression of freedom of the press.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But exactly a century later, a modern group of academics, researchers and writers around the world is giving it another go — fearing that the world is once again sleepwalking into dictatorship and violence. More than 400 scholars from dozens of countries, including at least 30 Nobel laureates, are reprising the 1925 Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals to warn that “the threat of fascism is back.”</p>

<li>Tulane Environmentalist Resigns Amid Research ‘Gag Order’</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>An environmental researcher at Tulane University resigned Wednesday after accusing campus officials, reportedly under pressure from Gov.&nbsp;Jeff Landry, of issuing a “gag order” that prevented her from publicly discussing her work, which focused on racial disparities in the petrochemical workforce.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Scholarly publications, not gag orders, are the currency of academia,” Kimberly Terrell, the now-former director of community engagement at Tulane’s Environmental Law Clinic, wrote in her resignation letter. “There is always room for informed debate. But Tulane leaders have chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“It started with the pro-Palestinian activism on our campus and others across the country. It’s emboldened a lot of political leaders to feel they can make inroads by silencing faculty in other areas,” Michelle Lacey, a math professor and president of Tulane’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, told Inside Higher Ed. “That was the catalyst for creating a climate where university administrators are very nervous, especially now as we see the government pulling funding for areas of research they don’t like.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Last summer, he [Governor Landry, Trump aligned[ enacted a law that allows him to directly appoint board chairs at the state’s public colleges and universities. And in November, following Trump’s election, Landry publicly called on officials at Louisiana State University to punish a law professor who allegedly made brief comments in class about students who voted for the president.</p>

<p>A State Department cable dated May 27, 2025, which is not public but has been reviewed by numerous media outlets, orders U.S. embassies and consulates abroad to pause all new interviews for foreign nationals who are applying for a nonimmigrant (i.e.&nbsp;temporary) visa to come to the United States in the visa categories of F-1 (for foreign students participating an academic program), J-1 (for participants in the State Department’s Exchange Visitor Program), and M-1 (for international students pursuing vocational or other non-academic studies). The ostensible reason offered is so that State Department officials can conduct additional vetting of visas applicants, by reviewing their social media accounts. According to reports, the cable reads: “Effective immediately, in preparation for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting, consular sections should not add any additional student or exchange visitor (F, M, and J) visa appointment capacity until further guidance is issued [in a separate, forthcoming telegram], which we anticipate in the coming days.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As staff members examine students’ profiles, the cable instructed, they must look to “identify applicants who bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles; who advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists and other threats to U.S. national security; or who perpetrate unlawful antisemitic harassment or violence.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One State department official noted that the agency issued 446,000 student visas in 2023. “If everyone has to now have their social media scrubbed for derogatory information? Officers do not have that time.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The cable suggested that State Department officials should request that applicants make public and accessible all portions of their social media accounts and should penalize them if they refuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If portions of accounts remain “set to ‘private’ or otherwise limited, you should treat the case as any other where an applicant fails to provide certain information on request,” the cable stated. It added, in a bolded sentence, “You must consider whether such failure reflects evasiveness or otherwise calls into question the applicant’s credibility.”</p>

<p>Now, after just over six weeks of work, that group known as the Joint Associations Group is homing in on a plan to rework how the government funds research, and they want feedback from the university research community before they present a proposal to Congress and the Trump administration at the end of the month.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Unfortunately, something is going to change,” said Barbara Snyder, president of the Association of American Universities. “Either we will be part of it or it will be imposed upon us … Significant division in the research community is going to kill us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Both versions of what JAG is calling the Fiscal Accountability in Research model, or FAIR, are geared toward offering more accountability and transparency about how federal research dollars are spent. JAG hopes that in the end, the new model will be simpler than the current one. They also want to nix terms like “indirect costs rate” and “overhead” for either essential research support or general research operations in an effort to underscore that the money goes toward the real costs of research.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>One model, which the group calls FAIR No.&nbsp;1, would include costs related to managing the grant, general research operations and facilities as a fixed percentage of the total budget. The percentage would be based in part on the type of institution and research. This approach is designed to be simple and reasonable, according to the group’s presentation, but it’s more general, which makes it “difficult to account for the wide array of research frameworks that now exist.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The other model, FAIR No.&nbsp;2, would more accurately reflect the actual costs of a project and make the structure for federal grants more like those from private foundations. Under this model, essential research support would be lumped into the project costs while funding for general research operations, such as payroll and procurement, would be a fixed percentage of the total budget. That change would likely increase the direct costs of the project.</p>

<p>Under the Trump administration, the conditions for accepting federal funding have become increasingly partisan. The Chronicle first reported in May that at least two notice-of-award letters from the National Institutes of Health, which are legal documents spelling out the terms of grants, mandated compliance with Trump’s executive order recognizing only two sexes, effectively excluding transgender people from U.S. policy.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now, according to scientists and colleges contacted by The Chronicle, an increasing number of grant letters — from the NIH and other agencies — require compliance with one or more of Trump’s executive orders and with civil-rights laws, which Trump has sought to reinterpret.</p>

<p>The high chamber’s proposal, which ties a university’s access to federal loans to how much their students earn after graduation, is simpler and more productive than the House proposal, known as risk-sharing, which would require colleges to pay an annual penalty based on their students’ outstanding loan balances, they say.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Senate plan seems to be based on an existing regulation known as gainful employment, which uses students’ earnings and debt to measure whether for-profit and non-degree programs adequately prepare their students for the workforce.

</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The NIH has rarely revoked funding once it has been awarded. Out of the tens of thousands of grants overseen by the institution since 2012, it terminated fewer than five for violations of the agency’s terms and conditions.</p>

<p>The mass cancellation of grants in response to political policy shifts has no precedent, former and current NIH officials told ProPublica. It threatens the stability of the institution and the scientific enterprise of the nation at large.</p>

<p>(And more details on sabotage at the NIH)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Nearly two weeks after the court’s preliminary injunction was issued, the National Institutes of Health’s then-acting head, Dr.&nbsp;Matthew J. Memoli, drafted a memo that details how the agency, in response to Trump’s executive orders, cut funding for research grants that “promote or inculcate gender ideology.” An internal spreadsheet of terminated NIH grants also references “gender ideology” and lists the number associated with Trump’s executive order as the reason for the termination of more than a half dozen research grants. [Yet, “Lawyers for the federal government have repeatedly claimed in court filings that the administration has been complying with the order (stopping it from cutting funding related to gender identity and the provision of gender-affirming care in response to President Donald Trump’s executive orders)”]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Washington attorney general’s allegation that the Trump administration violated a court order comes as the country lurches toward a constitutional crisis amid accusations that the executive branch has defied or ignored court orders in several other cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>in depositions filed in the case last week, two NIH officials testified that DOGE itself gave directions in hundreds of grant terminations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The lawsuit offers an unprecedented view into the termination of more than 600 grants at the NIH over the past two months. Many of the canceled grants appear to have focused on subjects that the administration claims are unscientific or that the agency should no longer focus on under new priorities, such as gender identity, vaccine hesitancy and diversity, equity and inclusion. Grants related to research in China have also been cut, and climate change projects are under scrutiny.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Mike Faulk, the deputy communications director for the Washington state attorney general’s office, told ProPublica in an email that the administration “appears to have used DOGE in this instance to keep career NIH officials in the dark about what was happening and why.” “While claiming to be transparent, DOGE has actively hidden its activities and its true motivations,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Their claim to have complied with the preliminary injunction is almost laughable,” said Faulk, the office’s deputy communications director. “The Trump administration is playing games with no apparent respect for the rule of law.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The executive order detailing DOGE’s responsibilities describes the cost-cutting team as advisers that consult agency heads on the termination of contracts and grants. No language in the orders gives the DOGE team members the authority to direct the cancellation of grants or contracts. However, the depositions portray Riley [former consultant for McKinsey &amp; Co.&nbsp;and DOGE member] as giving directions on how to conduct the terminations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Jeremy Berg, who led the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the NIH from 2003 to 2011, told ProPublica that the administration’s assessment of the institution was “not fair and not based on any substantial analysis or evidence,” and the proposed cuts “would be absolutely devastating to NIH and to biomedical research in the United States.”</p>

<p>In a hearing on Monday, a federal judge put off making a ruling on whether to continue blocking President Trump’s proclamation banning Harvard international students and researchers from entering the country. The judge, Allison Burroughs of the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, agreed to decide within a week and extended an order to temporarily halt the policy until then.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The hearing came after Harvard swiftly filed a legal challenge to Trump’s directive in early June, a day after it was issued. Burroughs quickly granted a temporary restraining order and is now weighing a longer-lasting injunction.</p>

<p>While many in the academic world have accused Columbia of caving to Mr.&nbsp;Trump’s pressure, the university’s strategy — so far — has limited the bleeding, even as Harvard has absorbed cut after cut, stretching into billions of dollars. While opponents of the Trump administration’s crackdown have lauded Harvard for standing its ground, it is far from clear which school will be better off in the long run. And the question remains whether Columbia’s path can offer a road map for other universities attacked by the president.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Still, the federal Department of Education threatened Columbia’s accreditation in early June, saying that in its eyes, the school was no longer meeting the standards necessary for the key credential, alleging it had “acted with deliberate indifference” toward the harassment of Jewish students.</p>

<p>Through the spring, Northwestern used university money to pay bills previously covered by NIH grants, spending tens of millions of dollars monthly to keep labs and trials running without a break. Researchers and administrators now worry this stopgap can’t last.</p>

<p>The sudden collapse of the once-symbiotic relationship between the federal government and higher education is torpedoing a half-century-old university business model and upending how science is done.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s a complete turnaround for today’s university researchers, for whom federal funding—from NIH, National Science Foundation, and other agencies—has never been in question. Billions of dollars have flowed annually to universities through competitive grants, funding basic research that can lead to cutting-edge medicine and technological innovations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>At places like Harvard and Columbia, funding cuts or freezes have come with lists of demands spanning changes to admissions and faculty hiring.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>At others, like Northwestern, the path to restoration is less clear. In April, a Trump administration official told media that $790 million in federal funds to the Illinois university would be frozen, but that number has never been detailed or communicated directly to school officials, a school spokesman said. Nor has Trump told the university what they can do to get the money returned, the spokesman said, though the school’s president has met with Trump’s education secretary to discuss the situation on campus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>University officials say bills to NIH have simply gone unpaid. NIH grant officers in April were told not to communicate with Northwestern and other affected universities about the freeze, according to an email viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Northwestern researchers have had grants terminated or frozen from multiple agencies, the university said.</p>

<p>Asked by a faculty member what he and his peers could do to help, the University of Iowa’s interim vice president for research suggested only “acting as a private citizen to call our legislators and tell them what a bad idea this is (from your own phone or using your own email).” The campus’s location in a solidly red state hindered it from fighting the policy change, Lois J. Geist seemed to imply in her reply. “Being located where we are we have limited ability to publicly fight this as faculty or as an institution.”</p>

<p>The Trump administration’s efforts to reduce research funding are siphoning cash from many campuses, sometimes by hundreds of millions of dollars.

<p>As the educational impact of LLM use only begins to settle with the general population, in this study we demonstrate the pressing matter of a likely decrease in learning skills based on the results of our study.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A recent report from the consulting firm Deloitte confirms what everyone working in higher education already knows: Donald Trump “brings a layer of complexity to questions of financial sustainability for colleges and universities.” The administration’s dizzying range of punitive measures for academe comes at an inconvenient time: Our institutions are already grappling with diminished state support and a looming demographic cliff.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Research universities face the greatest financial pressure. Grant cancellations and planned cuts to the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health are creating enormous budgetary holes: The budgets for graduate programs and scientific-research staffing were developed on the assumption that federal funding was a constant.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In red states like Florida, Indiana, and Texas, Trump-supporting Legislatures are also working to bust up faculty and administrative autonomy as a condition of public funding. The administration’s cultural agenda for higher ed is likely to be advanced most fully in states where MAGA-friendly legislatures have near-total control. This doesn’t mean blue-state public research universities are off the hook. Data shows that state financial support for higher ed has been up over the past couple of years, but we might have reached high tide. Ebbing state funding would pair dangerously with cuts to federal research.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Regional Publics and Community Colleges</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>At first glance these institutions appear to be in an enviable position: They don’t rely heavily on federal research funding, they don’t have big endowments to tax, they don’t enroll lots of international students, and they tend to fly below the political radar. Domestic undergraduate enrollment is unlikely to collapse, and a looming economic downturn could even cause an uptick in demand for these institutions since people look to increase their skills and retrain during recessions. Still, the major financial-aid reform provisions tucked away in the “Big, Beautiful” reconciliation bill recently passed by the House will clearly affect these institutions if enacted, though in mixed ways. For community colleges, their lower tuition prices, shorter program duration, and a vocational orientation might yield comparative advantages in a world with diminished federal student aid. Risk-sharing provisions that put campuses on the hook for portions of unpaid student debt might harm minority-serving institutions and campuses that serve low-income and other students with historically higher rates of loan default. Requiring full-time enrollment for Pell Grant eligibility, as proposed in the House bill, would harm these institutions too. The Senate seems less excited about the risk-sharing and full-time Pell provisions, but the financial-aid outlook remains murky.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Regional universities and community colleges also face enrollment risks. Pennsylvania State University plans to shutter several regional campuses, and federal pressure on research universities will have knock-on effects within state university systems. Looking to secure their own budgets, research universities might employ aggressive tactics to lure students otherwise headed to regional campuses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Rather than forming partnerships with the federal government, colleges will now have to endure the headwinds created by federal policy and, in some cases, engage in direct confrontation with the administration. I do not believe Trump will be able to destroy American higher education, but his administration will try, and the sector will suffer. Research footprints will shrink, the number of programs and activities on offer will be reduced, and the workloads of already-overextended faculty and staff will increase. Senior administrators can’t say so, but in the next few years colleges and universities will become diminished versions of themselves. Those of us who teach or work in higher ed will watch our institutions decline.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Campuses will look for revenue to replace federal dollars. Public research universities will increase their enrollments, often at the expense of their regional counterparts. Our wealthiest colleges may quietly roll back their need-blind admissions policies. The steady trickle of emails from university communications announcing exciting new cancer research efforts and new science facilities will slow. Departmental budgets will be slashed to the point where faculty concern is less for vanishing tenure lines than for the survival of the department itself. Teaching course loads will grow, library operational hours will shrink, and students, stung by loan restrictions and red tape, will increasingly rush from class to part-time jobs. In short, the sector will be smaller, poorer, and capable of doing fewer things.</p>
