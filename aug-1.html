<h1>Aug 1</h1>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week.</p>
<p>Thanks to ES, VAC, JC, BE, KK, MP for helping out with the digest this week.</p>
<p>And now the come for faculty senates …. (See George Mason)</p>

<li>The Review: Georgetown president says ‘we police’ the faculty. What?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/newsletter/the-review/2025-07-28">https://www.chronicle.com/newsletter/the-review/2025-07-28</a></p>
<p>(Thanks BE!!)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“As in earlier rounds of hearings, the leaders tried hard to depict their institutions as eager to quash any sign of the putative scourge of anti-Jewish hatred on campus….[ Interim President of Georgetown Robert M. Groves said] that, since the October 7 attacks, Georgetown has ‘learned that we need to adapt to changing circumstances, almost continuously.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A congressional hearing is presumably one such circumstance; Groves had to adapt in real time to North Carolina Republican Virginia Foxx’s campaign against a Georgetown faculty member’s [ Jonathan A.C. Brown’s] right to extramural political speech. [ Brown is cited for his tweet saying, “I hope Iran does some symbolic strike on a [US military] base.”]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“As far as academic freedom goes, this isn’t remotely an edge case. Brown’s speech is obviously protected. He is commenting both as a scholar of the region (one who is careful, indeed, to note the limits of his own expertise) and as a citizen about a major geopolitical event.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Jonathan A.C. Brown is being investigated by Georgetown and condemned by Congress precisely for “speech in the public domain.” Given the susceptibility of campus discourse on the Middle East to Congressional censure, it is hard not to hear, in Groves’s blithe assurance that he and his fellow administrators ‘police’ their professors, something more intrusive than the rhetoric of academic rights and responsibilities.”</p>

<li>AAUP Letter Supports CUNY Law Professor Ramzi Kassem</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.aaup.org/news/aaup-letter-supports-cuny-law-professor-ramzi-kassem">https://www.aaup.org/news/aaup-letter-supports-cuny-law-professor-ramzi-kassem</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>These accusations are outrageous. Any discipline leveled against Professor Kassem for his representation of Mr.&nbsp;Khalil would violate AAUP standards on academic freedom and tenure and the terms of CUNY’s faculty labor contract. Even more critically, such discipline would contravene Professor Kassem’s constitutionally-protected speech and association. Federal courts have interpreted the First Amendment to protect the right of faculty to engage in an “independent and uninhibited exchange of ideas” as well as the right of the university to engage in “autonomous decisionmaking” free of legislative or, for that matter, judicial control.1 Courts have interpreted the First Amendment to prohibit efforts by the government to “usurp” the right of academic institutions to “determine [for themselves] who may teach” or “what may be taught.” Professor Kassem’s representation of Mr.&nbsp;Khalil as part of his clinical practice falls squarely within these protections.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The National AAUP stands in staunch support of Professor Ramzi Kassem’s academic and constitutional freedoms, and we will continue to closely watch CUNY’s defense of its faculty.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But the agency’s memo goes even further than ED’s guidance, suggesting that programs that rely on what they describe as stand-ins for race, like recruitment efforts that focus on majority-minority geographic areas, could violate federal civil rights laws. The directive applies to any organization that receives federal funds, and DOJ officials warned that engaging in potentially unlawful practices could lead to a loss in grant funding.</p>

<p>Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, said that the memo is “another example of governmental overreach into academic freedom, institutional autonomy and shared governance that conditions federal funding on ideological alignment with the administration’s viewpoints.”</p>

<p>The halt stemmed from a footnote in an Office of Management and Budget document, according to an email sent to NIH staff Tuesday afternoon by the NIH’s associate director for budget, Neil Shapiro.

And on December 5, a couple months before such deportations began in earnest, Jeffrey Lax—chair of the business department at Kingsborough College at the City University of New York (CUNY)—joined the advisory board of DJHC. S.A.F.E. Campus, an organization that Lax had founded in 2023, was already serving as DJHC’s fiscal sponsor, which allowed the newer group to receive tax-exempt donations.</p>

<p>On the DHJC board of advisors, Lax is joined by prominent pro-Israel agitator and former Columbia business professor Shai Davidai, who has long been trying to penalize pro-Palestine voices at the university, and who has also participated in a Columbia alumni WhatsApp group where members aimed to identify student protesters and call for their expulsion, firing, or deportation. And Lax and Davidai are only the most prominent of a handful of campus affiliates backing such groups. Drop Site News’ reporting reveals that current and former instructors at least four schools across the northeastern U.S. have publicly supported Betar, DJHC, and Canary Mission.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>George Mason University’s Faculty Senate has ramped up its support of the university’s president, Gregory Washington, as the institution faces four federal investigations that some observers believe are designed to force his ouster. Washington is contending with a hostile Board of Visitors and no protection from the state’s attorney general.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Faculty Senate is demanding that the board provide the “strongest defense possible” of Washington, George Mason’s first Black president, and the university’s diversity initiatives, as the Justice and Education Departments probe whether GMU has engaged in race-based hiring and discriminatory admissions practices and failed to address antisemitism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“President Washington has shown every indication of consistently and faithfully exercising compliance with evolving directives from federal and Commonwealth authorities,” the resolution states. “Evidence, truth, and due process should be the foundation for all decisions, not allegations that have not been fully investigated.”</p>

<p>Professors quickly published a resolution supporting their president and the university’s efforts around diversity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Now, Justice Department officials say they will investigate the faculty, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In a letter sent on Friday, the Trump administration said it would seek drafts of the faculty resolution, all written communications among the Faculty Senate members who drafted the resolution, and all communications between those faculty members and the office of the university’s president, Gregory Washington.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Free speech advocates quickly denounced the move as an attack on academic freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Faculty senate resolutions are positions taken by a university’s elected faculty body, like the one at George Mason. They typically carry no force and normally attract little notice beyond the campus newspaper. But these are not normal times for higher education.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Solon Simmons, a sociologist who is president of the Faculty Senate, called the government’s inquiry “flabbergasting.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“None of us has any idea why the Department of Justice is so interested in a matter of local academic shared governance,” Dr.&nbsp;Simmons wrote in an email.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“An outcome the Board committed to was to ‘faculty and staff demographics that mirror student demographics,’” Dr.&nbsp;Simmons said. “It is not our language, it is theirs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>”While FIRE would prefer governing bodies such as faculty senates remain neutral on issues of political contention,” she said, “the federal government’s actions represent the latest in a pattern of shakedowns against colleges and universities that will certainly chill faculty speech.”</p>

<p>In a series of seven letters obtained by Inside Higher Ed via an open records request, Dhillon and other Department of Justice officials laid out their increasingly aggressive case that the university was at risk of losing federal funding, just as Ivy League institutions like Harvard and Columbia Universities had in the months prior for allegations of antisemitism. The Cavalier Daily first published the letters in full.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Taken together, the letters sent between April 11 and June 17 were used to launch what the DOJ called an investigation but that legal experts say is among the latest instances in an all-out pressure campaign against higher education.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But now, with similar investigations launched against George Mason University (also located in Virginia), many onlookers view these letters as a template for how President Trump will continue to leverage federal funding to impose his priorities on colleges and universities across the country—altering who is admitted and what is taught and by whom. Higher education experts say it’s an aggressive tactic that will create a climate of uncertainty for years to come.</p>

<p>Trump Administration Freezes $108 Million in Funds to Duke University - The New York Times</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Duke University is the latest high-profile school, from Columbia University to Harvard, that the Trump administration has targeted and stripped of a large amount of federal funding, based on vague accusations that the university abets antisemitism or supports diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The move comes amid a wider pressure campaign from the Trump administration to shift the ideological tilt of American higher education.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The university is weighing layoffs amid a budget crunch. It’s considering about $350 million in cuts, amounting to roughly 10 percent of its budget. In a video message last month, Duke’s president, Vincent E. Price, said the university was trying to sort out proposals from the federal government “that have quite dire implications for the university.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The university, which is in Providence, R.I., secured a pledge from the government that the deal would not be used “to dictate Brown’s curriculum or the content of academic speech.” The Trump administration is also required to restore millions of dollars in federal research funding that it had blocked in recent months, and Brown avoided the naming of an independent monitor to oversee the deal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Paxson appeared to sense the prospect of a backlash, even as she promoted the agreement, devoting more than 350 words of her letter to explain why Brown had elected to negotiate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Before her school came under such direct pressure from the White House, Dr.&nbsp;Paxson was more vocal than many higher education leaders about the Trump administration’s tactics against prominent universities. In March, she said that the administration’s “demands raise new and previously unthinkable questions about the future of academic freedom and self-governance for those that are committed to continuing to serve this country as leading research institutions.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In the lawsuit, three Jewish students and a Jewish professor said that the university had countenanced antisemitic behavior at a tent encampment set up in 2024 by protesters demonstrating against the war in Gaza.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The plaintiffs said the university had not intervened when protesters prevented students who were wearing Jewish symbols like a star of David or the Israeli flag or a skullcap from crossing campus. The university even provided the barricades used to keep people out and stationed security guards on campus who sent Jewish students away instead of helping them get through, the court papers said.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The settlement, announced Tuesday, will require the university to give $6.45 million, including legal fees, to the plaintiffs and to charitable entities. The money will also support the university’s own efforts to combat antisemitism and support the Jewish community on campus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Just hours after the settlement was announced, the Department of Justice said it had found U.C.L.A. in violation of civil rights law and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment for failing to adequately respond to complaints of “severe, pervasive and objectively offensive harassment and abuse” of Jewish and Israeli students during the protest encampment in the spring of 2024.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The department sent a 10-page letter to Dr.&nbsp;Michael V. Drake, president of the University of California, laying out the evidence it had reviewed, including the lawsuit. It said that the department was now looking to enter into a voluntary resolution agreement with U.C.L.A. or go to court.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For generations, 529 college savings plans were a no-brainer for most parents wanting to start a college fund. They are tax-advantaged and primarily used to pay for higher education expenses. The accounts can be used for a range of education-related expenses, not just college tuition, like books, private K-12 tuition and more. If funds go unused, the account can be transferred to another beneficiary, like a sibling or a grandchild.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But now, some parents are pumping the brakes on the accounts and rethinking how they plan to save for their children’s future. With growing uncertainty around the value of higher education, and a fear of locking funds into something their child may not use, many of these parents are looking for flexible plans that don’t tie their money exclusively to higher education.</p>
