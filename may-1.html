<h1>May 1</h1>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>Please find a partial summary of some of the actions taken by the federal government as relates to Higher Education in general and CUNY in specific in the past week. Sadly another terrible, horrible, no good, very bad week. More tricks (re) emplyed: monkeying with grants; tax-exempt status; accreditation; student visas; and a Draconian proposed budget. Atleast it seems clear – resistance is the only means forward.</p>

<p>You are on the frontlines of a war that is unfolding against U.S. higher education. We look to you for leadership and coalition-building during a time when the stakes have never been higher.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://president.brown.edu/president/advocating-brown-whats-stake">https://president.brown.edu/president/advocating-brown-whats-stake</a></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s important to share what is at stake for Brown. The research funding cuts that Brown has already suffered are causing immediate harm, forcing us to reconfigure our operations and budget to address funding shortfalls. Any long-term cuts of significant magnitude would imperil, or possibly end, several areas of high-impact research at Brown. This would be devastating to Brown’s research community, including the undergraduate, graduate and medical students we teach, and the people, patients and communities that benefit from the results of our research.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Even more concerning, since early April, Brown has not been reimbursed for any expenses associated with active (i.e., not terminated) grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), whose grants make up roughly 70% of Brown’s overall research portfolio. Again, we have not been given any official explanation for why expenses for active grants are not being reimbursed. These unreimbursed expenses, which amount to millions of dollars per week, represent a significant threat to Brown’s financial sustainability and its ability to conduct federally funded research.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>As we navigate the current environment, I continue to share a set of core principles:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Brown will always defend the ability for students and scholars to teach and learn without fear of government intrusion or censorship, which is fundamental to efforts to protect academic freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Brown is deeply committed to following the law and maintaining an academic community where all can participate fully in the life of the institution. This means maintaining a campus that is free of all forms of harassment and discrimination for all community members, including addressing allegations of discrimination based on shared ancestry. We are proud of our initiatives to combat antisemitism, many of which we launched even before this became a major area of focus for the federal government.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Brown will continue to provide resources and support to members of our international community.</p>

<p>Since then [Harvard saying “no”], a group of more than 500 higher ed leaders signed a statement, released by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, opposing “undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses.” Presidents of highly selective universities, threatened by some of the most severe federal funding cuts, have reportedly developed a network to agree on shared boundaries and talk strategy. And faculty members at the Big Ten universities are ramping up pressure on their institutions to collaborate and defend one another against threats from the administration.</p>

<p>Faculty senates across the nation are endorsing the idea of standing collectively against the actions of the Trump administration.

<p>“while it’s encouraging to see some organizations coming together within their existing siloes, that’s not enough. There’s a real opportunity – and imperative – for all stakeholders in the research community to join forces. Each group plays a vital role in the research endeavor. Now is the time to show our support for everyone’s contributions, and to help everyone understand that, by dismantling the research infrastructure through censorship and defunding, we hamper research progress and its benefits in the US and across the world. We call on the industry bodies that represent all these different stakeholders to leverage their relationships and networks to develop something that’s bigger than just a campaign — a movement that spans all individuals and organizations working to fund, conduct, support, and disseminate the science and scholarship essential for our survival and success.</p>

<p>Lots here non-higher ed.&nbsp;but the editorial board uses this as a model</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The leaders of Harvard University have offered a model of principled opposition that maximizes the chances of success. When Mr.&nbsp;Trump began threatening the university with canceled funds this spring, many Harvard professors and students urged administrators to head straight to the ramparts and denounce him. Alan Garber, Harvard’s president, took a wiser approach. He acknowledged that some of Mr.&nbsp;Trump’s criticisms had merit. Harvard, like much of elite higher education, has, in fact, been blasé about antisemitism, and it has too often prioritized progressive ideology over an independent search for truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By admitting as much, Mr.&nbsp;Garber strengthened Harvard’s political position. He said what many Americans believed. But when the administration issued a list of ludicrous demands, Harvard fought back hard. It filed a lawsuit, with help from a legal team that included conservative litigators, and became a national symbol of resistance to his lawlessness. Mr.&nbsp;Garber made Harvard look reasonable and Mr.&nbsp;Trump unreasonable.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To understand what’s happening, you need to see how the backlash against higher education began. You need to trace its roots in the 1960s, its evolution through the culture wars of the 1980s and ’90s, and into the current populist fray. Then you need to do something about it. Professors, administrators, students, and concerned citizens can no longer stand on the sidelines, shaking our heads and deploring the potentially devastating consequences. The simple truth is this: For decades, outside forces have — both consciously and unintentionally — undermined the integrity and quality of public higher education in America. And time and time again, a divided academic community has failed to combat them effectively. We can and must do better. Seeds of resistance are sprouting. Together, we must nurture their growth. There is no time to lose.</p>

<p>Colleges have traditionally relied on economies of scale to maintain their bottom lines. With labs, dormitories, lecture halls, athletic facilities, and so much else, colleges have exorbitant fixed costs. Those fixed costs have typically been covered in large part by student enrollment. Now that enrollment is declining, higher education’s cost curve is breaking. No amount of cutting will fix the underlying problem. Many colleges have masked their operating deficiencies by using Covid-relief funds in the past few years, but now, with those funds exhausted, they are dealing with a broken economic model. The Trump administration’s cuts to research funding are adding additional stress to colleges’ already precarious cost structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>More damaging than the cost curve is the shift in how students view the value of higher education. Having grown up with Amazon, Netflix, and Google, students expect a speedy, on-demand, and low-friction experience. Moreover, they increasingly view college through a transactional lens: They pursue a degree to get a job. So they regard college much like any other consumer product, and like those other products, they expect it to be delivered how they want, when they want. Why wouldn’t they?</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Four years ago, the University of Virginia Board of Visitors endorsed a call to double the number of underrepresented faculty by 2030 and to develop a plan for building a student population that better reflected the state’s racial and socioeconomic diversity. The university’s president, James E. Ryan, said the move signaled that “becoming a more diverse, equitable place is both the right and the smart thing to do.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>On Tuesday, the board voted unanimously to rescind any such numerical goals as part of a sweeping effort to wipe out evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The Trump administration had warned university officials, only the day before, that it had received complaints that the university wasn’t acting fast enough to carry through on its promise to “dismantle DEI apparatuses.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In its letter on Monday, the Justice Department said the president had failed to produce a sufficiently detailed progress report. (A campus spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question about whether the required report had been submitted.) It demanded that Ryan and Hardie certify by Friday that the vestiges of DEI have been removed from every division, department, program, and school.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Board of Visitors deliberated during a closed session on Tuesday. The public portion of the meeting was not live-streamed. It’s unclear whether the board brought up the fact that Ryan, who became president in 2018, was one of more than 550 higher-education leaders who signed a statement circulated by the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&amp;U) that condemned “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” in academe.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Faculty Senate was concerned enough about the board’s reaction that on Monday, it passed a resolution supporting Ryan and his decision to sign the AAC&amp;U statement, saying it “expresses principles that are essential to upholding UVA’s mission, reputation, and operations.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Faculty Senate had encouraged Ryan to collaborate with other university presidents to promote higher education’s contributions to the nation. Ryan’s signature, it said, reaffirmed the university’s established policies on institutional statements and free expression. The former discourages the university from commenting on social or political issues “unless the matter directly affects the university’s mission or operations.”</p>

<p>Reports from CNN and The Washington Post both cite unnamed administration officials who confirmed that the Internal Revenue Service has been asked to consider if the university has violated any of the requirements of charitable organizations, such as engaging in political activity.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?’ Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Guess who said that last rant)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The loss of tax-exempt status “would endanger our ability to carry out our educational mission,” Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an email. “It would result in diminished financial aid for students, abandonment of critical medical research programs, and lost opportunities for innovation. The unlawful use of this instrument more broadly would have grave consequences for the future of higher education in America,” he wrote.</p>

<p>. Beneath the surface, three different visions are competing to define the Trump higher-education agenda: Elon Musk’s attempt to reform government with a chainsaw, Rep.&nbsp;Virginia Foxx’s plans to slash student-aid spending, and Christopher F. Rufo’s culture war. Ironically, none of these three people are Trump appointees themselves. But the confluence and conflict among them will determine the course of a White House that moves forward decisively when there is internal consensus but swerves erratically when major players fight over the steering wheel.</p>
